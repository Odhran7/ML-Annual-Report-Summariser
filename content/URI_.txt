covid19 

covid19 was first identified in people in late 2019 covid19 spread rapidly throughout the world and in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of covid19 on the operations and financial position of united rentals and on the global economy uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the covid19 pandemic to ultimately subside which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against covid19 including against emerging variant strains and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health see industry overview and economic outlook below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020 the health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority and we also implemented a detailed covid19 response plan which is explained in more detail in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and which we believe helped mitigate the impact of covid19 on our results 

we began to experience a decline in revenues in march 2020 when rental volume declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions the volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021 and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets as well as encouraging gains in endmarket indicators as reflected in our 2022 forecast covid19 is discussed in more detail throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

strategy 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

we are continuing to manage the impact of covid19 as discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital and in particular calls for 

• a consistently superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the crossselling of the various services we offer throughout our network we utilize a proprietary software application total control ®  which provides our key customers with a single inhouse software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs total control ® is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong longterm relationships with our larger customers our digital capabilities including our total control ® platform allow our sales teams to provide contactless endtoend customer service 

• the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix with a dual objective to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth we believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts primarily large construction and industrial customers as well as select local contractors our fleet teams analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns 

• a continued focus on “lean” management techniques including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement  we continue to implement lean kaizen processes across our branch network with the objectives of reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers improving invoice accuracy and service quality reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations 

• the continued expansion of our specialty footprint as well as our tools and onsite services offerings and the crossselling of these services throughout our network  we believe that the expansion of our specialty business as exhibited by our acquisition of general finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as well as our tools and onsite services offerings will further position united rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings and 

• the pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business  strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals 

industry overview and economic outlook 

united rentals serves the following three principal endmarkets for equipment rental in north america industrial and other nonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential construction which includes remodeling in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp international holdings inc “bakercorp” which allowed for our entry into select european markets as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in may 2021 we completed the acquisition of general finance which allowed for our entry into select markets in australia and new zealand see item 2—properties for further geographical detail on our rental network in 2021 based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

• industrial and other nonconstruction rentals represented approximately 50 percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals to manufacturers energy companies chemical companies paper mills railroads shipbuilders utilities retailers and infrastructure entities 

• commercial construction rentals represented approximately 46 percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals related to the construction and remodeling of facilities for office space lodging healthcare entertainment and other commercial purposes and 

• residential rentals represented approximately four percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals of equipment for the construction and renovation of homes 

we estimate that based on industry estimates from the ara 2021 north american equipment rental industry revenue grew approximately 4 percent yearoveryear in 2021 our full year rental revenue increased by 149 percent yearoveryear which included the impact of the general finance acquisition that was completed in may 2021 and is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as discussed in more detail throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the increase in rental revenue includes the significant impact in 2020 of covid19 which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions our estimated north american market share of approximately 15 percent in 2021 increased from 14 percent in 2020 

in 2022 based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect a continuation of the market recovery experienced in 2021 following a market decline in 2020 which included the pronounced impact of 

covid19 specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 10 percent in 2022

competition 

we primarily operate in the united states and canada and have a limited presence in europe australia and new zealand the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 15 percent market share in north america based on 2021 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara estimated market share is calculated by dividing our total 2021 north american rental revenue by ara’s forecasted 2021 industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure see industry overview and economic outlook above for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020 which included the pronounced impact of covid19 as well as projected performance in 2022 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from storage tanks at certain locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain locations

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as 

the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

industry and economic risks 

our business is cyclical in nature economic slowdowns and decreases in general economic activity have in the past caused weakness in our endmarkets and had adverse effects on our revenues and operating results and could do so again in the future 

our general rental equipment and specialty equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature in the past weakness in our endmarkets has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our endmarkets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our endmarkets either temporarily or longterm 

• a decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending 

• a lack of availability of credit 

• excess fleet in the equipment rental industry 

• a decrease in the level of exploration development production activity and capital spending by oil and natural gas companies 

• an increase in the cost of construction materials 

• an increase in interest rates 

• adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region 

• a prolonged shutdown of the us government 

• public health crises and epidemics such as covid19 

• supply chain disruptions or 

• terrorism or hostilities involving the united states canada europe australia or new zealand 

the covid19 pandemic and its impact on business and economic conditions have adversely affected and may in the future again adversely affect our results of operations and financial position those adverse effects could be material 

the scale and scope of the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the effectiveness of vaccines against covid19 including against emerging variant strains and the impact that the covid19 pandemic and the various measures that have been implemented to protect public health have had on the economy and financial markets have adversely affected and may in the future again adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in particular the covid19 pandemic 

• impacted customer demand for equipment rentals 

• reduced the availability and productivity of our employees 

• caused us to experience an increase in costs as a result of among other factors our emergency and business continuity measures supply chain disruptions cost inflation delayed payments from our customers and uncollectible accounts and 

• impacted previously announced strategic plans including our share repurchase program 

the covid19 pandemic could cause any of the impacts described above to recur or could cause other unpredictable events including events that could impact our ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets on terms favorable to us or at all and there can be no assurance that the covid19 pandemic will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position in the future further even though certain vaccines have been widely distributed and accepted in some geographies there can be no assurance that the vaccines will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 either over the longterm or against new emerging variants of covid19 even after the covid19 pandemic subsides the us economy and other major global economies may experience a recession and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the us and other major markets therefore it remains difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our results of operations and financial position in addition 

to the extent that covid19 adversely affects our results of operations or financial position it may also heighten the other risks described in this item 1arisk factors 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects additionally potential climate change regulation including a potential carbon tax could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products see “operational risks– climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets ” 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states national and global companies or divisions of national and global companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

increases in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business in the past has been and in the future could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additionally potential climate change regulation including a potential carbon tax could increase the overall cost of fuel to us and have a material adverse effect on us see “operational risks– climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets ” 

risks related to our indebtedness and liquidity 

our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2021 our total indebtedness was 97 billion our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to adverse economic industry or competitive developments including adverse economic impacts from covid19 

• making it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic financial market or industry conditions 

• requiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service reducing the funds available for other purposes including funding working capital capital expenditures acquisitions execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes or otherwise constraining our financial flexibility 

• restricting our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” our senior secured term loan credit facility “term loan facility” and the indentures governing urna’s outstanding indebtedness   

• affecting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness 

• decreasing our profitability or cash flow 

• causing us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions 

• causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less debt and lower debt service requirements 

• resulting in a downgrade in our credit rating or the credit ratings of any of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries which could increase the cost of further borrowings 

• requiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2021 we had 28 billion of indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates as of december 31 2021 our variable rate indebtedness represented 29 percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

• reducing or delaying capital expenditures 

• limiting our growth 

• seeking additional capital 

• selling assets or 

• restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness 

even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future and such indebtedness may be secured indebtedness the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness permit us to recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant or comply with other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

we rely on our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility to provide liquidity for our business including to fund capital expenditures acquisitions operating expenses and other liquidity needs the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2021 specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant under the abl facility or the financial tests under the accounts receivable securitization facility or comply with any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations future debt arrangements we enter into may contain similar provisions 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to the financial covenant and other financial tests various other covenants in the abl facility term loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii indebtedness iii mergers consolidations and acquisitions iv sales transfers and other dispositions of assets v loans and other investments vi dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments vii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries viii transactions with affiliates and ix issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced 

or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

risks related to our strategic transactions and investments 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition over the timeframe we expect or at all or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

• unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies and unidentified issues that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller 

• greater than expected expenses such as the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any transaction 

• unfavorable accounting treatment and unexpected increases in taxes 

• adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees and suppliers 

• inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited experience 

• difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired company within our existing operations including the consolidation of corporate and administrative functions 

• difficulty in integrating marketing information technology and other systems 

• difficulty in conforming standards controls procedures and policies business cultures and compensation structures 

• difficulty in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets 

• loss of key employees of the acquired company 

• operating inefficiencies that have a negative impact on profitability 

• impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

• failure to achieve anticipated synergies or receiving an inadequate return of capital and 

• strains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate negotiate and integrate acquisitions 

our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business 

results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes other indebtedness andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2021 we had 55 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our securities 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

• the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

• changes in the size of our rental fleet andor in the rate at which we sell our used equipment 

• excess fleet in the equipment rental industry 

• changes in private nonresidential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects 

• changes in demand for or utilization of our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions competition or other factors 

• commodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of fuel and steel to our equipment suppliers which can result in increased equipment costs for us 

• other cost fluctuations such as costs for employeerelated compensation and healthcare benefits 

• labor shortages andor disputes work stoppages or other labor difficulties 

• potential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations 

• supply chain or other disruptions that impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all 

• completion of acquisitions divestitures or recapitalizations 

• increases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations 

• the possible need from time to time to record goodwill impairment charges or other writeoffs or charges due to a variety of occurrences such as the adoption of new accounting standards the impairment of assets rental location divestitures dislocation in the equity andor credit markets consolidations or closings restructurings the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the buyout of equipment leases and 

• currency risks and other risks associated with international operations 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

• announcements of developments related to our business 

• market perceptions of any proposed merger or acquisition and the likelihood of our involvement in other merger and acquisition activity 

• variations in our revenues gross margins earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations 

• departure of key personnel 

• purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by institutional investors or transactions by insiders 

• fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy our market and the markets served by our customers 

• investor perceptions of the equipment rental industry in general and our company in particular 

• fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas 

• expectations regarding our share repurchase program and 

• the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries 

in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in january 2022 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under the new program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 1 billion excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses the new authorization replaces the prior 500 million program which was paused in march 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and under which we had 243 million of remaining authorization 

although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities in addition the current administration has proposed a tax on share repurchases which if adopted in its current form or another form that makes share repurchases more expensive may also impact our decision to engage in share repurchases also our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under each of the abl facility and the term loan facility a 

change of control as defined in the applicable credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility or the term loan facility as applicable and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

operational risks 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions while delinquencies and credit losses did not materially increase during 2021 they may increase in the future if economic conditions worsen as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover in the past we have experienced volatility in our stock price and we may experience such volatility again in the future which may make it more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

in addition we must continue to identify hire train and retain key personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who provide technical skills required for our companys growth there is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent the failure to recruit and retain necessary key personnel could cause disruption harm our business and hamper our ability to grow our company 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a general strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to address potential labor shortages improve servicing capabilities improve sales force effectiveness and focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we also continue to pursue general cost reduction strategies the extent to which these efforts and strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2022 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material 

adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner at a reasonable cost or at all 

disruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance 

supply chain disruptions could impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all to date our supply chain disruptions have been limited but we may experience including as a result of the covid19 pandemic more severe supply chain disruptions in the future or supplier inability to manufacture or deliver equipment or parts any suspension or delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide us adequate equipment or supplies or in our ability to procure equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all could impair our ability to meet customer demand and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers including tariffs on raw materials or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could adversely affect our ability to access and use certain applications and could depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software employee error or malfeasance phishing attacks security breaches disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain which include cloudbased networks and data center storage 

we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks we are continuously developing and enhancing our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access this continued development and enhancement requires us to expend significant additional resources however we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants during the covid19 pandemic we face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities 

in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others have led in one limited instance and could in the future lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems and could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits fines and other means of regulatory enforcement for example the general data protection regulation regulation eu 2016679 the “gdpr” has caused european union “eu” data protection requirements to be more stringent and provides for greater penalties noncompliance with the gdpr could lead to lower revenues increased costs including fines which could be significant and other material adverse effects on our results of operations in addition 

countries such as the united kingdom the “uk” have implemented the gdpr through their own legislation for example the uk data protection act 2018 and certain countries and us states have proposed or adopted their own data protection legislation complying with any new regulatory requirements could require us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business 

any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets 

climate change and its association with greenhouse gas emissions is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities the us federal government certain us states and certain other countries and regions have adopted or are considering legislation or regulation imposing overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors or facility categories such new laws or regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations could increase the costs of operating our businesses reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations failure to comply with any legislation or regulation could potentially result in substantial fines criminal sanctions or operational changes moreover even without such legislation or regulation the perspectives of our customers stockholders employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change are continuing to evolve and increased awareness of or any adverse publicity regarding the effects of greenhouse gases could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our products and services 

additionally as severe weather events become increasingly common our or our customers’ operations may be disrupted which could result in increased operational costs or reduced demand for our products and services and climate change may also reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for weatherrelated events in addition climate change may impact the global economy including as a result of disruptions to supply chains while we have invested in the administration of programs and physical loss prevention improvements to mitigate the risk of natural disasters causing disruption to our ability to serve our customers and communities in times of need extended periods of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we anticipate that climate changerelated risks will increase over time 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

• the market price for new equipment of a like kind 

• wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance 

• the time of year that it is sold 

• the supply of used equipment on the market 

• the existence and capacities of different sales outlets 

• the age of the equipment at the time it is sold 

• worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment and 

• general economic conditions 

we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states in canada europe australia and new zealand as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada europe australia and new zealand are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on 

fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions changes in such laws or regulations or any material failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways in addition laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction could result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk 

we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

• our insurance policies reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies our size are often subject to significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions 

• our director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual nonindemnifiable loss but is subject to a deductible for company reimbursement coverage 

• we do not currently maintain companywide standalone coverage for environmental liability other than legally required coverage since we believe the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides and 

• certain types of claims such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct which are often alleged in third party lawsuits might not be covered by our insurance 

we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs in addition as environmental and safety regulations have tended to become stricter we could incur additional costs in complying 

with requirements that are promulgated in the future these include climate change regulation which could materially affect our operating results through increased compliance costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 1149 branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states and puerto rico which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different and potentially conflicting requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 1450 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 18950 employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated 

as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in 2021 we adopted sec guidance that is intended to modernize simplify and enhance certain disclosures throughout this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in accordance with this guidance we have omitted discussions comparing 2020 and 2019 results as such disclosures were included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 as discussed below in march 2020 we first experienced rental volume declines associated with covid19 and the covid19 impact was more pronounced in 2020 than 2021 our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 and our quarterly reports on form 10q filed in 2021 include detailed disclosures addressing the covid19 response plan that is summarized below 

covid19 

as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of covid19 on the operations and financial position of united rentals and on the global economy uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the covid19 pandemic to ultimately subside which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against covid19 including against emerging variant strains and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health see item 1 businessindustry overview and economic outlook for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020 

we began to experience a decline in revenues in march 2020 which is when the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic and when our rental volume first declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions the volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021 and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets as well as encouraging gains in endmarket indicators as reflected in our 2022 forecast in early march 2020 we initiated contingency planning ahead of the impact of covid19 on our endmarkets 

our covid19 response plan is focused on five workstreams 1 ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers 2 leveraging our competitive advantages to support the needs of customers 3 aggressively managing capital expenditures 4 controlling core operating expenses and 5 proactively managing the balance sheet with a focus on liquidity we believe that this response plan helped mitigate the impact of covid19 on our results as noted above our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 and our quarterly reports on form 10q filed in 2021 include additional detailed covid19 disclosures the impact of covid19 on our business is discussed throughout this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 1345 rental locations we primarily operate in the united states and canada and have a limited presence in europe australia and new zealand see item 2—properties for further detail although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” of 158 billion and a north american branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the us our size also gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 4300 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2021 equipment rental revenues represented 84 percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

we are continuing to manage the impact of covid19 which is discussed above our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital and in particular calls for 

• a consistently superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the crossselling of the various services we offer throughout our network we utilize a proprietary software application total control ®  which provides our key customers with a single inhouse software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs total control ® is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong longterm relationships with our larger customers our digital capabilities including our total control ® platform allow our sales teams to provide contactless endtoend customer service 

• the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix with a dual objective to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth we believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts primarily large construction and industrial customers as well as select local contractors our fleet teams analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns 

• a continued focus on “lean” management techniques including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement  we continue to implement lean kaizen processes across our branch network with the objectives of reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers improving invoice accuracy and service quality reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations 

• the continued expansion of our specialty footprint as well as our tools and onsite services offerings and the crossselling of these services throughout our network  we believe that the expansion of our specialty business as exhibited by our acquisition of general finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as well as our tools and onsite services offerings will further position united rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings and 

• the pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business  strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals 

in 2022 based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect a continuation of the market recovery experienced in 2021 following a market decline in 2020 which included the pronounced impact of covid19 specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 10 percent in 2022 see item 1 business industry overview and economic outlook for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020 

as discussed below fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates time utilization and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue for the full year 2021 

• equipment rentals increased 149 percent yearoveryear including the impact of the may 2021 acquisition of general finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

• average oec increased 40 percent yearoveryear including the impact of the general finance acquisition 

• fleet productivity increased 104 percent primarily due to improved fleet absorption in 2021 2020 reflected more pronounced rental volume declines associated with covid19 and in 2021 we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our endmarkets and 

• 72 percent of equipment rental revenue was derived from key accounts as compared to 74 percent in 2020 key accounts are each managed by a single point of contact to enhance customer service the slight decrease from 2020 includes the impact of the general finance acquisition which added revenue from australia and new zealand that is not from key accounts 

financial overview 

prior to taking actions pertaining to our financial flexibility and liquidity we consider the impact of covid19 on liquidity and assess our available sources and anticipated uses of cash including with respect to sources cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment in 2021 we took the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business 

• issued 750 principal amount of 3 3  4 percent senior notes due 2032 

• redeemed all 1 billion principal amount of our 5 7  8 percent senior notes due 2026 and 

• amended and extended our accounts receivable securitization facility which expires on june 24 2022 and may be further extended on a 364day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility including an increase in the size of the facility from 800 to 900 

total debt as of december 31 2021 was flat yearoveryear in 2021 borrowings under the abl facility were used to fund most of the cost of the general finance acquisition discussed above 2021 debt activity also included the use of cash generated from operations net of the funds used for capital expenditures to reduce borrowings under the abl facility excluding the impact of the general finance acquisition and the net impact of the debt issuance and redemption discussed above as of december 31 2021 we had available liquidity of 2851 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and availability under the abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities

the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects lower margins from equipment rentals excluding depreciation and increased sga expense partially offset by higher margins from sales of rental equipment gross margin from equipment rentals excluding depreciation decreased 110 basis points primarily due to a higher bonus accrual which reflects improved profitability and increases in certain operating expenses including delivery costs as a percentage of revenue sga expense increased primarily due to increased bonus expense which reflects improved profitability gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 were as follows   



 

1 reflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on oec which is recorded at cost 

2 reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates time utilization and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue rental rate changes are calculated based on the yearoveryear variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year mix includes the impact of changes in customer fleet geographic and segment mix the positive fleet productivity for 2021 and the negative fleet productivity for 2020 include the impact of covid19 which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions as discussed further above the covid19 volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021 and in 2021 we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our endmarkets 

3 reflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue see note 3 for further detail excluding owned equipment rental revenue 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs collectively these ancillary fees represented approximately 14 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2021 delivery and pickup revenue which represented approximately eight percent of equipment rental revenue in 2021 is the most significant ancillary revenue component sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

2021 total revenues of 97 billion increased 139 percent compared with 2020 equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types together they accounted for 94 percent of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 equipment rentals increased 149 percent primarily due to a 104 percent increase in fleet productivity which included the more pronounced impact of covid19 which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions in 2020 covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 in 2021 we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our endmarkets sales of rental equipment increased 128 percent primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market and the impact of the general finance acquisition 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience and as applicable current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 50 percent of cost the weighted average salvage value of our rental equipment is 11 percent of cost immaterial salvage values are assigned to our property and equipment rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset can generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 170 or 213 respectively if the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately 19 any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 36 or 55 respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost market or income approach or a combination of certain of these methods depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks the estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates revenue growth rates operating margins terminal values useful lives and other prospective financial information goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions the significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital when appropriate our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired as well as the estimated life of the assets can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization and in certain instances through impairment charges if the asset becomes impaired in the future as discussed below we regularly review for impairments 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

when conducting the goodwill impairment test we are required to compare the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions with the carrying amount as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 our divisions were our operating segments we conducted the goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2021 at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level we conducted the goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2020 at the same reporting unit level although at that time the reporting unit was also the operating segment see note 5 for further discussion of our segment structure 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

  business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

  longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

  discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2021 we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our mobile storage and mobile storage international reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 59 percent as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in may 2021 we completed the acquisition of general finance all of the assets in the mobile storage and mobile storage international reporting units were acquired in the general finance acquisition the estimated fair values of our mobile storage and mobile storage international reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 10 percent and 17 percent respectively as all of the assets in the mobile storage and mobile storage international reporting units were recorded at fair value as of the may 2021 acquisition date we 

expected the percentages by which the fair values for these reporting units exceeded the carrying values to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2020 we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts we considered the impact of covid19 when performing the test and it did not have a material impact on the test results our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 42 percent as discussed above in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 22 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill we review the recoverability of our rental equipment property and equipment and lease assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if there are such indications we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business as discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded asset impairment charges of 14 36 and 5 respectively the 2020 charges principally related to the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and were not related to covid19 

in support of our review for indicators of impairment we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance and conclude whether indicators of impairment exist associated with our longlived assets including rental equipment we also specifically review the financial performance of our rental equipment such review includes an estimate of the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment property and equipment or lease assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

we have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of nearterm working capital needs and determined that such cash could no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested as a result our prior assertion that all undistributed earnings of our foreign 

subsidiaries should be considered indefinitely reinvested changed in the fourth quarter of 2021 we identified additional cash in our foreign operations in excess of nearterm working capital needs and remitted 203 of cash from foreign operations such amount represents the cumulative amount of identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of nearterm working capital needs the taxes recorded associated with the remitted cash were immaterial in both 2020 and 2021 

we continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested if we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and specialty the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities this segment operates throughout the united states and canada the specialty segment includes the rental of specialty construction products such as i trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment iii fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment transfer and treatment and iv mobile storage equipment and modular office space the specialty segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment primarily operates in the united states and canada and has a limited presence in europe australia and new zealand 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our four geographic divisions—central northeast southeast and west—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have occasionally been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these divisions though such variances have generally been small close to or less than 10 percent measured versus the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals divisions for the five year period ended december 31 2021 there was no general rentals division with an equipment rentals gross margin that differed materially from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals divisions the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have occasionally been divisions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals divisions though the specific divisions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated and such variances have generally not exceeded 10 percent by a significant amount we monitor the margin variances and confirm margin similarity between divisions on a quarterly basis 

we believe that the divisions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each division is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our divisions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these divisions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the divisions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these reporting segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   



equipment rentals 2021 equipment rentals of 82 billion increased 149 percent as compared to 2020 primarily due to a 104 percent increase in fleet productivity which included the more pronounced impact of covid19 which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions in 2020 covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 in 2021 we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our endmarkets equipment rentals represented 84 percent of total revenues in 2021 

on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 83 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and specialty respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 110 percent as compared to 2020 primarily due to increased fleet productivity which included the more pronounced impact of covid19 during 2020 in 2021 we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our endmarkets specialty rentals increased 279 percent as compared to 2020 including the impact of the general finance acquisition on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition revenues of general finance equipment rentals increased 18 percent the increase in equipment rentals reflects increased fleet productivity which included the more pronounced impact of covid19 during 2020 as well as a slight increase in average oec 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 sales of rental equipment represented approximately 10 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2021 sales of rental equipment increased 128 percent from 2020 primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market and the impact of the general finance acquisition 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 sales of new equipment represented approximately 3 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2021 sales of new equipment of 203 decreased 178 percent from 2020 primarily due to supply chain challenges for a discussion of the risks associated with supply chain disruptions see item 1a risk factors “operational risks disruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance  

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2021 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2020 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 service and other revenues represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2021 service and other revenues increased 225 percent from 2020 primarily due to the more pronounced impact of covid19 in 2020 

  fourth quarter items  there were no unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 that had a material impact on our financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2020 we redeemed all of our 4 5  8 percent senior notes due 2025 using borrowings available under our abl facility upon redemption we recognized a loss of 24 in interest expense net reflecting the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes 

segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 were as follows 



general rentals for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 general rentals accounted for 72 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period for the year ended december 31 2021 general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit increased by 315 and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 170 basis points from 2020 which included a 26 asset impairment charge that primarily reflected the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and was not related to covid19 excluding the impact of asset impairment charges equipment rentals gross margin increased 130 basis points yearoveryear primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by a higher bonus accrual which reflects improved profitability and increases in certain operating expenses including delivery costs as a percentage of revenue 

specialty  for the year ended december 31 2021 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 233 and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 90 basis points from 2020 gross margin increased primarily due to decreases in depreciation and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue partially offset by a higher proportion of revenue from certain lower margin ancillary fees in 2021 and increases in certain operating expenses including delivery costs as a percentage of revenue 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   



2021 gross margin of 397 percent increased 240 basis points from 2020 equipment rentals gross margin increased 170 basis points from 2020 which included a 30 asset impairment charge that primarily reflected the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and was not related to covid19 excluding the impact of asset impairment charges equipment rentals 

gross margin increased 150 basis points yearoveryear primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by higher bonus expense which reflects improved profitability and increases in certain operating expenses including delivery costs as a percentage of revenue gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 580 basis points from 2020 primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability the more pronounced impact of covid19 in 2020 and the impact of the general finance acquisition and such revenue types did not account for a significant portion of total gross profit gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2021 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2021   



sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the increase in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to higher bonus and stock compensation expenses which reflect improved profitability 

the merger related costs primarily reflect transaction costs associated with the general finance acquisition that was completed in may 2021 as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions each of which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to acquisition that significantly impact our operations 

the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks 

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 included aggregate debt redemption losses of 30 and 183 respectively the debt redemption losses reflect the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased by 189 percent yearoveryear primarily due to decreases in average debt and the average cost of debt 

other expense income net primarily includes i currency gains and losses ii finance charges iii gains and losses on sales of nonrental equipment and iv other miscellaneous items 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 increased yearoveryear primarily due to the release in 2020 of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits 

in march 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act” was enacted the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods alternative minimum tax credit refunds modifications to the net interest deduction limitations technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property and deferral of employer payroll taxes the cares act did not materially impact our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 we have deferred employer payroll taxes of 27 under the cares act all of which is due in 2022 

balance sheet  accounts receivable net increased by 362 or 275 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to increased revenue prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by 209 or 557 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to refundable deposits on expected purchases primarily of rental equipment pursuant to advanced purchase agreements as discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements rental equipment net increased by 1855 billion or 213 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to the impact of the general finance acquisition and increased capital expenditures as discussed above capital expenditures were significantly reduced in 2020 due to covid19 while capital expenditures in 2021 have exceeded historic precovid19 levels accounts payable increased by 350 or 751 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to increased business activity accrued expenses and other liabilities increased 161 or 224 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to a higher bonus accrual which reflects increased profitability and the impact of the general finance acquisition see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on accrued expenses and other liabilities deferred taxes increased by 386 or 218 percent from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 primarily due to the impact of the general finance acquisition and increased capital expenditures see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on deferred taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the 2021 capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 37 billion of holdings common stock under five completed share repurchase programs on january 28 2020 our board of directors authorized a 500 share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 and was intended to run for 12 months through march 2020 when the program was paused due to the covid19 pandemic we repurchased 257 of common stock under the program on january 25 2022 our board authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program which is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022 and be completed in 2022 this program replaces the prior 500 program 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 144 cash equivalents at december 31 2021 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2021 



  

1 the maximum outstanding debt under the abl facility exceeded the average outstanding debt primarily due to the use of borrowings under the abl facility to fund most of the cost of the general finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

2 as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements the accounts receivable securitization facility expires on june 24 2022 and may be further extended on a 364day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility 

we expect that our principal shortterm over the next 12 months and longterm needs for cash relating to our operations will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit the table below presents information on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash excluding operating cash flows pertaining to normal business operations such as human capital costs which are not accurately estimable as of december 31 2021 

  

 

1 the payments due with respect to a period represent i in the case of debt and finance leases the scheduled principal payments due in such period and ii in the case of operating leases the payments due in such period for noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further debt information and note 14 for further finance lease and operating lease information 

2 estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of december 31 2021 

3 as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding advance purchase orders which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business with our equipment and inventory suppliers these purchase orders can generally be cancelled by us without cancellation penalties the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers pursuant to these purchase orders and the related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout 2022 and 2023 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were 2030 billion and 103 in 2021 and 2020 respectively as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan which contributed to net rental capital expenditures in 2020 that were significantly below historic levels 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 24 2022 were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

loan covenants and compliance as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2021 specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl and term loan facilities and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2021 we i generated cash from operating activities of 3689 billion and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 998 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment and intangible assets of 3198 billion ii purchase other companies for 1436 billion and iii make debt payments net of proceeds of 98 during 2020 we i generated cash from operating activities of 2658 billion which included 300 of cash outflow for refundable deposits on expected rental equipment purchases as discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 900 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 1158 billion ii make debt payments net of proceeds of 1985 billion and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 286 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of and plus proceeds from equipment and intangible assets the equipment and intangible asset purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2021 was 1514 billion a decrease of 926 as compared to 2440 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased net rental capital expenditures purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities net rental capital expenditures increased 1927 billion or 1871 percent yearoveryear as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan which contributed to net rental capital expenditures in 2020 that were significantly below historic precovid19 levels while capital expenditures in 2021 have exceeded historic levels 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and 

support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 

information regarding guarantors of urna indebtedness 

urna is 100 percent owned by holdings and has certain outstanding indebtedness that is guaranteed by both holdings and with the exception of its us special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the company’s accounts receivable securitization facility the “spv” captive insurance subsidiaries and immaterial subsidiaries acquired in connection with the general finance acquisition all of urna’s us subsidiaries the “guarantor subsidiaries” other than the guarantee by our canadian subsidiary of urnas indebtedness under the abl facility none of urna’s indebtedness is guaranteed by urnas foreign subsidiaries the spv captive insurance subsidiaries or immaterial subsidiaries acquired in connection with the general finance acquisition together the “nonguarantor subsidiaries” the receivable assets owned by the spv have been sold or contributed by urna to the spv and are not available to satisfy the obligations of urna or holdings’ other subsidiaries holdings consolidates each of urna and the guarantor subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements urna and the guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percentowned and controlled by holdings holdings’ guarantees of urna’s indebtedness are full and unconditional except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met the holdings guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws 

the guarantees of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries are made on a joint and several basis the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances including sale of the guarantor subsidiary the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiarys assets the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants or the notes being rated investment grade by both standard  poor’s ratings services and moody’s investors service inc or in certain circumstances another rating agency selected by urna like the holdings guarantees the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to subordination provisions to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws 

all of the existing guarantees by holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness the secured indebtedness of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries including guarantees of urna’s existing and future secured indebtedness will rank effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors the guarantees of urna’s indebtedness are effectively junior to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors including our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2021 indebtedness of our nonguarantors included i 843 of outstanding borrowings by the spv in connection with the company’s accounts receivable securitization facility ii 141 of outstanding borrowings under the abl facility by nonguarantor subsidiaries and iii 9 of finance leases of our nonguarantor subsidiaries 

covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the other agreements governing our debt impose operating and financial restrictions on urna holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries including limitations on the ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments as of december 31 2021 the amount available for distribution under the most restrictive of these covenants was 1602 billion the company’s total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of holdings as of december 31 2021 our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments which includes urna’s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of holdings was 5396 billion 

based on our understanding of rule 310 of regulation sx rule 310 we believe that holdings’ guarantees of urna indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in rule 310 which enable us to present summarized financial information for holdings urna and the consolidated guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with rule 1301 of regulation sx the summarized financial information excludes information regarding the nonguarantor subsidiaries in accordance with rule 310 separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented 

the summarized financial information of holdings urna and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis is as follows 






 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2021 we had an aggregate of 28 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2021 under these facilities as of december 31 2021 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 21 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2021 we had an aggregate of 69 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 12 see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  we primarily operate in the us and canada and have a limited presence in europe australia and new zealand during the year ended december 31 2021 our foreign subsidiaries accounted for 955 or 10 percent of our total revenue of 9716 billion and 134 or 7 percent of our total pretax income of 1846 billion based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the company as a whole we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the company’s management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a–15e and 15d–15e of the exchange act as of december 31 2021 based on the evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2021 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

strategy 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

we are currently managing the impact of covid19 as discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital and in particular calls for 

• a consistently superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the crossselling of the various services we offer throughout our network we utilize a proprietary software application total control ®  which provides our key customers with a single inhouse software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs total control ® is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong longterm relationships with our larger customers our digital capabilities including our total control ® platform allow our sales teams to provide contactless endtoend customer service 

• the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix with a dual objective to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth we believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts primarily large construction and industrial customers as well as select local contractors our fleet teams analyses 

are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns 

• a continued focus on “lean” management techniques including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement  we continue to implement lean kaizen processes across our branch network with the objectives of reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers improving invoice accuracy and service quality reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations 

• the continued expansion of our trench power and fluid solutions footprint as well as our tools and onsite services offerings and the crossselling of these services throughout our network  we believe that the expansion of our trench power and fluid solutions business as well as our tools and onsite services offerings will further position united rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings and 

• the pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business  strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals 

industry overview and economic outlook 

united rentals serves the following three principal endmarkets for equipment rental in north america industrial and other nonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential construction which includes remodeling in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets the acquisition added 11 european locations in france germany the united kingdom and the netherlands to our branch network in 2020 based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

• industrial and other nonconstruction rentals represented approximately 49 percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals to manufacturers energy companies chemical companies paper mills railroads shipbuilders utilities retailers and infrastructure entities 

• commercial construction rentals represented approximately 47 percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals related to the construction and remodeling of facilities for office space lodging healthcare entertainment and other commercial purposes and 

• residential rentals represented approximately four percent of our rental revenue primarily reflecting rentals of equipment for the construction and renovation of homes 

we estimate that based on industry estimates from the american rental association ara 2020 north american equipment rental industry revenue decreased approximately 12 percent yearoveryear with similar declines in the us and canada in 2020 our full year rental revenue decreased by 103 percent yearoveryear we estimate that our north american market share of approximately 13 percent increased slightly in 2020 as discussed in more detail throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the decline in rental revenue includes the impact of the novel coronavirus “covid19” which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions 

in 2021 based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect modest market recovery following the declines experienced in 2020 which included the pronounced impact of covid19 specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 2 percent with higher growth expected in canada than the us 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment we believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repair and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet the optimum time to dispose of an asset 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence national accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least 500000 or customers doing business in multiple states we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs national accounts are a subset of key accounts which are our accounts that are managed by a single point of contact establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

• equipment sharing among branches  each branch within a region can access equipment located elsewhere in the region this fleet sharing increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches additionally fleet sharing allows us to be more disciplined with our capital spend 

• customer care center  we have a customer care center ccc in charlotte north carolina that handles all telephone calls to our customer service telephone line 1800urrents the ccc handles many of the 1800urrents telephone calls without having to route them to individual branches and allows us to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time 

• consolidation of common functions  we reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches such as accounts payable payroll benefits and risk management information technology and credit and collection 

our information technology systems  some of which are proprietary and some of which are licensed support our operations our information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of information technology specialists that supports our systems

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms 

we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 13 percent market share in north america based on 2020 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara estimated market share is calculated by dividing our total 2020 north american rental revenue by ara’s forecasted 2020 industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure see industry overview and economic outlook above for a discussion of market performance in 2020 which included the pronounced impact of covid19 as well as projected performance in 2021

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

industry and economic risks 

our business is cyclical in nature economic slowdowns and decreases in general economic activity have in the past caused weakness in our end markets and had adverse effects on our revenues and operating results and could do so again in the future 

our general rental equipment and trench power and fluid solutions equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature in the past weakness in our end markets has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

• a decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending 

• a lack of availability of credit 

• excess fleet in the equipment rental industry 

• a decrease in the level of exploration development production activity and capital spending by oil and natural gas companies 

• an increase in the cost of construction materials 

• an increase in interest rates 

• adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region 

• a prolonged shutdown of the us government 

• public health crises and epidemics such as covid19 or 

• terrorism or hostilities involving the united states canada or europe 

the covid19 pandemic and its impact on business and economic conditions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial position those adverse effects could be material 

the scale and scope of the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the distribution acceptance and effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the impact that the covid19 pandemic and the various measures that have been implemented to protect public health have had on the economy and financial markets have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we have implemented business continuity and emergency response plans to continue to provide equipment rental services to our customers and to support our operations while taking health and safety measures such as implementing worker distancing measures and using a remote workforce where possible there can be no assurance that the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus including but not limited to vaccination social distancing policies restrictions on travel and reduced operations and extended closures of many businesses and institutions including our customers will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position in particular the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus could 

• impact customer demand for equipment rentals 

• reduce the availability and productivity of our employees including by requiring temporary branch closures in the event that positive tests for covid19 are identified 

• cause us to experience an increase in costs as a result of our emergency and business continuity measures delayed payments from our customers and uncollectable accounts 

• impact our cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets on terms favorable to us or at all 

• impact our ability to complete previously announced strategic plans including our share repurchase program on time or at all and 

• cause other unpredictable events 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact on us that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the locations in which we operate in particular a delay in wide distribution of a vaccine or a lack of public acceptance of a vaccine could lead people to continue to selfisolate and not participate in the economy at prepandemic levels for a prolonged period of time further even if a vaccine is widely distributed and accepted there can be no assurance that the vaccine will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 even after the covid19 pandemic subsides the us economy and other major global economies may experience a recession and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the us and other major markets therefore it remains difficult to predict the potential impact of the virus on our results of operations and financial position in addition to the extent that covid19 adversely affects our results of operations or financial position it may also heighten the other risks described in this item 1arisk factors 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects additionally potential climate change regulation including a potential carbon tax could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

increases in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business in the past has been and in the future could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additionally potential climate change regulation including a potential carbon tax could increase the overall cost of fuel to us and have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our indebtedness and liquidity 

our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2020 our total indebtedness was 97 billion our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to adverse economic industry or competitive developments including adverse economic impacts from covid19 

• making it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic financial market or industry conditions 

• requiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service reducing the funds available for other purposes including funding working capital capital expenditures acquisitions execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes or otherwise constraining our financial flexibility 

• restricting our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” our senior secured term loan credit facility “term loan facility” and the indentures governing urna’s outstanding indebtedness   

• affecting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness 

• decreasing our profitability or cash flow 

• causing us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions 

• causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less debt and lower debt service requirements 

• resulting in a downgrade in our credit rating or the credit ratings of any of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries which could increase the cost of further borrowings 

• requiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2020 we had 26 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 27 percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

• reducing or delaying capital expenditures 

• limiting our growth 

• seeking additional capital 

• selling assets or 

• restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness 

even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future and such indebtedness may be secured indebtedness the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness permit us to recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants or comply with other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

we rely on our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility to provide liquidity for our business including to fund capital expenditures acquisitions operating expenses and other liquidity needs the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2020 specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant under the abl facility or the financial tests under the accounts receivable securitization facility or comply with any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility the term loan facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations future debt arrangements we enter into may contain similar provisions 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility term loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii indebtedness iii mergers consolidations and acquisitions iv sales transfers and other dispositions of assets v loans and other investments vi dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments vii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries viii transactions with affiliates and ix issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

risks related to our strategic transactions and investments 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

• unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies and unidentified issues that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller 

• greater than expected expenses such as the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any transaction 

• unfavorable accounting treatment and unexpected increases in taxes 

• adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees and suppliers 

• inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited experience 

• difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired company within our existing operations including the consolidation of corporate and administrative functions 

• difficulty in integrating marketing information technology and other systems 

• difficulty in conforming standards controls procedures and policies business cultures and compensation structures 

• difficulty in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets 

• loss of key employees of the acquired company 

• operating inefficiencies that have a negative impact on profitability 

• impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

• failure to achieve anticipated synergies or receiving an inadequate return of capital and 

• strains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate negotiate and integrate acquisitions 

our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes other indebtedness andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2020 we had 52 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our securities 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

• the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

• changes in the size of our rental fleet andor in the rate at which we sell our used equipment 

• excess fleet in the equipment rental industry 

• changes in private nonresidential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects 

• changes in demand for or utilization of our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions competition or other factors 

• commodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of fuel and steel to our equipment suppliers which can result in increased equipment costs for us 

• other cost fluctuations such as costs for employeerelated compensation and healthcare benefits 

• labor shortages work stoppages or other labor difficulties 

• potential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations 

• completion of acquisitions divestitures or recapitalizations 

• increases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations 

• the possible need from time to time to record goodwill impairment charges or other writeoffs or charges due to a variety of occurrences such as the adoption of new accounting standards the impairment of assets rental location divestitures dislocation in the equity andor credit markets consolidations or closings restructurings the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the buyout of equipment leases and 

• currency risks and other risks associated with international operations 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

• announcements of developments related to our business 

• market perceptions of any proposed merger or acquisition and the likelihood of our involvement in other merger and acquisition activity 

• variations in our revenues gross margins earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations 

• departure of key personnel 

• purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by institutional investors or transactions by insiders 

• fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy our market and the markets served by our customers 

• investor perceptions of the equipment rental industry in general and our company in particular 

• fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas 

• expectations regarding our share repurchase program and 

• the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries 

in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in january 2020 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 and was intended to run for 12 months under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 500 million excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses through march 18 2020 when the program was paused due to the covid19 pandemic we repurchased 257 million of common stock under the program we are currently unable to estimate when or if the program will be restarted and we expect to provide an update at a future date 

although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities also our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under each of the abl facility and the term loan facility a change of control as defined in the applicable credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility or the term loan facility as applicable and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

operational risks 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions while delinquencies and credit losses did not materially increase during 2020 they may increase in the future if economic conditions worsen as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of reducing core operating expenses including overtime and temporary labor costs in response to the covid19 pandemic in addition we have been pursuing a general strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2021 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers including tariffs on raw materials or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software employee error or malfeasance phishing attacks security breaches disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain which include cloudbased networks and data center storage 

we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks we are continuously developing and enhancing our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access this continued development and enhancement requires us to expend additional resources however we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants during the covid19 pandemic we face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits fines and other means of regulatory enforcement for example the general data protection regulation regulation eu 2016679 the “gdpr” has caused european union “eu” data protection requirements to be more stringent and provides for greater penalties noncompliance with the gdpr can trigger fines of up to €20 million or 4 percent of annual worldwide revenue whichever is higher such failures could lead to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations in addition the requirements of the gdpr may necessitate changes to our existing business practices in order to comply with the gdpr or to address the concerns of our customers or business partners relating to the gdpr in addition countries such as the united kingdom the “uk” have implemented the gdpr through their own legislation for example the uk data protection act 2018 complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business further any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

• the market price for new equipment of a like kind 

• wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance 

• the time of year that it is sold 

• the supply of used equipment on the market 

• the existence and capacities of different sales outlets 

• the age of the equipment at the time it is sold 

• worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment and 

• general economic conditions 

we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states in canada and europe as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and europe are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk 

in addition effective december 31 2020 the uk officially withdrew its membership from the european union “brexit” the longterm effects of brexit are uncertain and may include among other things greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity our operations in the uk and europe as well as our north american operations could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by brexit or the actual withdrawal by the uk from the eu if we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively our business could be adversely affected our operations in the eu represented an immaterial part of our business as of december 31 2020 

climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets 

climate change and its association with greenhouse gas emissions is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities the us federal government certain us states and certain other countries and regions have adopted or are considering legislation or regulation imposing overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors or facility categories among other matters such new laws or regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations could increase the costs of operating our businesses reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations failure to comply with any legislation or regulation could potentially result in substantial fines criminal sanctions or operational changes moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness of or any adverse publicity regarding the effects of greenhouse gases could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our products and services 

additionally as severe weather events become increasingly common our or our customers’ operations may be disrupted which could result in increased operational costs or reduced demand for our products and services while we have invested in administration of programs and physical loss prevention improvements to mitigate the risk of natural disasters causing disruption to our ability to serve our customers and communities in times of need extended periods of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

• our insurance policies reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies our size are often subject to significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions 

• our director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual nonindemnifiable loss but is subject to a deductible for company reimbursement coverage 

• we do not currently maintain companywide standalone coverage for environmental liability other than legally required coverage since we believe the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides and 

• certain types of claims such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct which are often alleged in third party lawsuits might not be covered by our insurance 

we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs in addition as environmental and safety regulations have tended to become stricter we could incur additional costs in complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future these include climate change regulation which could materially affect our operating results through increased compliance costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 1018 branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states and puerto rico which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different and potentially conflicting requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 1330 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 16920 employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however 

there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal

covid19 

as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world the extent and duration of the covid19 impact on the operations and financial position of united rentals and on the global economy is uncertain see item 1 business industry overview and economic outlook above for a discussion of market performance in 2020 

prior to midmarch 2020 our performance was largely in line with expectations in earlymarch we initiated contingency planning ahead of the impact of covid19 on our endmarkets this planning has focused on five key workstreams that are the basis for our crisis response plan 

1 ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers above all else we are committed to ensuring the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers we have implemented a variety of covid19 safety measures including ensuring that branches have sufficient and adequate personal protection equipment we have also implemented appropriate social distancing practices and increased disinfecting of equipment and facilities 

2 leveraging our competitive advantages to support the needs of customers we have made modifications to enhance safety measures in our operating processes and protocols that support the needs of our customers additionally our digital capabilities allow customers to perform fully contactless transactions 

3 disciplined capital expenditures we have a substantial degree of flexibility in managing our capital expenditures and fleet capacity net rental capital expenditures purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment for 2020 decreased 1198 billion or 92 percent yearoveryear 

4 controlling core operating expenses a significant portion of our cash operating costs are variable in nature since march 2020 we have significantly reduced overtime and temporary labor primarily in response to the impact of covid19 furthermore we continue to leverage our current capacity to reduce the need for thirdparty delivery and repair services and minimize other discretionary expenses across general and administrative areas 

5 proactively managing the balance sheet with a focus on liquidity we are focused on ensuring that we maintain ample liquidity to meet our business needs as the impact of covid19 evolves as a result our current 500 share repurchase program was paused in midmarch 2020 at december 31 2020 our total liquidity was 3073 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and availability under the abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities we have no note maturities until 2026 

the impact of covid19 on our business is discussed throughout this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” as discussed below the response plan above helped mitigate the impact of covid19 on our results 

executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 1165 rental locations in the us canada and europe in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” of 138 billion and a north american branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the us the bakercorp acquisition discussed above added 11 european locations in france germany the united kingdom and the netherlands to our branch network our size also gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 4000 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2020 equipment rental revenues represented 84 percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

we are currently managing the impact of covid19 as discussed above our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital and in particular calls for 

• a consistently superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the crossselling of the various services we offer throughout our network we utilize a proprietary software application total control ®  which provides our key customers with a single inhouse software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs total control ® is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong longterm relationships with our larger customers our digital capabilities including our total control ® platform allow our sales teams to provide contactless endtoend customer service 

• the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix with a dual objective to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth we believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts primarily large construction and industrial customers as well as select local contractors our fleet teams analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns 

• a continued focus on “lean” management techniques including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement  we continue to implement lean kaizen processes across our branch network with the objectives of reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers improving invoice accuracy and service quality reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations 

• the continued expansion of our trench power and fluid solutions footprint as well as our tools and onsite services offerings and the crossselling of these services throughout our network  we believe that the expansion of our trench power and fluid solutions business as well as our tools and onsite services offerings will further position united rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings and 

• the pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business  strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals 

in 2021 based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect modest market recovery following the declines experienced in 2020 which included the pronounced impact of covid19 see item 1 business industry overview and economic outlook above for a discussion of market performance in 2020 specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 2 percent with higher growth expected in canada than the us 

as discussed below fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates time utilization and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue for the full year 2020 

• equipment rentals decreased 103 percent yearoveryear including the impact of covid19 on volumes 

• average oec decreased 22 percent yearoveryear 

• fleet productivity decreased 69 percent primarily due to the impact of covid19 since march when rental volume declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions and 

• 74 percent of equipment rental revenue was derived from key accounts as compared to 72 percent in 2019 key accounts are each managed by a single point of contact to enhance customer service 

financial overview 

prior to taking actions pertaining to our financial flexibility and liquidity we considered the impact of covid19 on liquidity and assessed our available sources and anticipated uses of cash including with respect to sources cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment in 2020 we took the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business 

• issued 750 principal amount of 4 percent senior notes due 2030 

• issued 11 billion principal amount of 3 7  8 percent senior notes due 2031 

• redeemed all 800 principal amount of our 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2025 

• redeemed all 11 billion principal amount of our 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2026 

• redeemed all 750 principal amount of our 4 5  8 percent senior notes due 2025 and 

• amended and extended our accounts receivable securitization facility including a reduction in the size of the facility from 975 to 800 

we have also used cash generated from operations to reduce borrowings under the abl facility and total debt has decreased 1746 billion or 153 percent since december 31 2019 as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan and in 2020 capital expenditures decreased significantly yearoveryear the decreased capital expenditures contributed to our ability to use proceeds from operations to reduce borrowings under the abl facility as of december 31 2020 we had available liquidity of 3073 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and availability under the abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities

equipment rentals gross margin interest expense net increased 21 yearoveryear interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 included debt redemption losses of 183 and 61 respectively excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased primarily due to decreases in average debt and the average cost of debt yearoveryear the effective income tax rate was largely flat but income tax expense decreased as a percentage of revenue sga expense as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to significant reductions in professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses which were implemented in response to covid19 partially offset by increases in salaries and stock compensation as a percentage of revenue total salary and stock compensation expense was largely flat yearoveryear generally reflecting normal variability but increased as a percentage of revenue due in part to the covid19 impact on revenue

as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of bakercorp and blueline in july 2018 and october 2018 respectively and the adjusted ebitda increase for 2019 includes the impact of these acquisitions the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 were as follows   



 

1 reflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on oec which is recorded at cost 

2 reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates time utilization and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue rental rate changes are calculated based on the yearoveryear variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year mix includes the impact of changes in customer fleet geographic and segment mix 

3 reflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue see note 3 for further detail excluding owned equipment rental revenue 

4 we completed the acquisitions of bakercorp and blueline in july 2018 and october 2018 respectively the pro forma information includes the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline the pro forma components are not reflected above for 2020 versus 2019 because bakercorp and blueline are fully reflected in our results for these periods 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs collectively these ancillary fees represented approximately 13 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2020 delivery and pickup revenue which represented approximately seven percent of equipment rental revenue in 2020 is the most significant ancillary revenue component sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

2020 total revenues of 85 billion decreased 88 percent compared with 2019 equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types together they accounted for 94 percent of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 equipment rentals decreased 103 percent covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 through february 2020 equipment rentals were up slightly yearoveryear since march equipment rentals have decreased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of covid19 fleet productivity decreased 69 percent primarily due to the impact of covid19 since march when rental volume declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions 

through february fleet productivity was flat yearoveryear and in line with expectations sales of rental equipment did not change materially yearoveryear 

2019 total revenues of 94 billion increased 162 percent compared with 2018 equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types together they accounted for 94 percent of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 equipment rentals increased 148 percent primarily due to a 177 percent increase in average oec which includes the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 41 percent primarily due to a 49 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 06 percent partially offset by the impact of fleet inflation sales of rental equipment increased 252 percent primarily due to increased volume which included the impact of the blueline acquisition driven by a larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience and as applicable current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2020 included an adjustment for the estimated impact of covid19 on future collectibility that was not material to our financial statements our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 174 or 226 respectively if the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately 18 any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 35 or 54 respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost market or income approach or a combination of certain of these methods depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks the estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates revenue growth rates operating margins terminal values useful lives and other prospective financial information goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities 

assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions the significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital when appropriate our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired as well as the estimated life of the assets can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization and in certain instances through impairment charges if the asset becomes impaired in the future as discussed below we regularly review for impairments 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 

as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in 2020 we adopted accounting guidance that eliminated the second step from the goodwill impairment test this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements prior guidance required utilizing a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment a second step was required if there was an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step required calculating the potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill we did not perform this second step for the goodwill impairment test conducted as of october 1 2020 or 2019 for 2020 because the adopted accounting guidance eliminated the second step and for 2019 because there was no indication that an impairment may have existed the first step of the impairment test requires comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

  business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

  longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

  discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2020 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts we considered the impact of covid19 when performing the test and it did not have a material impact on the test results our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 42 percent as discussed above in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 22 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2019 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 32 percent as discussed above in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 12 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill we review the recoverability of our rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if there are such indications we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded asset impairment charges of 36 which principally relate to the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and were not related to covid19 we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

in support of our review for indicators of impairment we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance and conclude whether indicators of impairment exist associated with our longlived assets including rental equipment we also specifically review the financial performance of our rental equipment such review includes an estimate of the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment or property and equipment 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant 

information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

we have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we identified 135 of cash in our foreign operations in excess of nearterm working capital needs and determined that this amount could no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested as a result our prior assertion that all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries should be considered indefinitely reinvested has changed and in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recorded the immaterial taxes on a distribution of the 135 of cash 

we continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested if we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes 

the tax act discussed above required a onetime transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments which we primarily recognized upon adoption of the tax act in 2017 as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax act in 2018 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities this segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and fluid solutions segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the fluid solutions and iv fluid solutions europe regions both of which rent equipment primarily used for fluid containment transfer and treatment the trench power and fluid solutions segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada and europe 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our eleven geographic regions—carolinas gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic mid central midwest northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for the five year period ended december 31 2020 three of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 25 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period for the five year period ended december 31 2020 the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was western canada the western canada regions equipment rentals gross margin of 309 percent for the five year period ended december 31 2020 was 25 percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the western canada regions equipment rentals gross margin was less than the 

other general rentals regions during this period primarily due to declines in the oil and gas business in the region the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and fluid solutions segment the trench power and fluid solutions segment includes the locations acquired in the july 2018 bakercorp acquisition as such there is not a long history of the acquired locations rental margins included in the trench power and fluid solutions segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and fluid solutions segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis the historic preacquisition margins for the acquired bakercorp locations are lower than the margins achieved at the other locations in the segment we expect that the margins at the acquired locations will increase as we realize synergies following the acquisition as a result of which we expect future margin convergence 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   



equipment rentals 2020 equipment rentals of 71 billion decreased 103 percent covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 through february 2020 equipment rentals were up slightly yearoveryear since march equipment rentals have decreased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of covid19 fleet productivity decreased 69 percent primarily due to the impact of covid19 since march when rental volume declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions through february fleet productivity was flat yearoveryear and in line with expectations equipment rentals represented 84 percent of total revenues in 2020 

on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 82 percent and 91 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased 118 percent as compared to 2019 primarily due to covid19 as noted above covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 when rental volume declined in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals decreased 53 percent as compared to 2019 primarily due to covid19 partially offset by a slight increase in average oec 

2019 equipment rentals of 80 billion increased 148 percent primarily due to a 177 percent increase in average oec which includes the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 41 percent primarily due to a 49 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 06 percent partially offset by the impact of inflation equipment rentals represented 85 percent of total revenues in 2019 

on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 83 percent and 92 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 117 percent as compared to 2018 primarily reflecting a 154 percent increase in average oec which includes the impact of the blueline acquisition on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of blueline equipment rental revenue increased 18 percent yearoveryear primarily due to a 38 percent increase in average oec partially offset by the impact of fleet inflation trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 268 percent as compared to 2018 primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions including bakercorp and cold starts on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp equipment rental revenue increased 128 percent yearoveryear primarily due to a 141 percent increase in average oec partially offset by the impact of fleet inflation the pro forma increase in average oec includes the impact of cold starts and acquisitions other than bakercorp 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 sales of rental equipment represented approximately 9 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2020 sales of rental equipment did not change materially from 2019 2019 sales of rental equipment of 831 increased 252 percent from 2018 primarily reflecting increased volume which included the impact of the blueline acquisition driven by a larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market average oec for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 177 percent yearoveryear 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 sales of new equipment represented approximately 3 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2020 sales of new equipment of 247 decreased 78 percent from 2019 primarily due to the impact of covid19 2019 sales of new equipment of 268 increased 288 percent from 2018 primarily reflecting increased volume driven by broadbased demand 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2020 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2019 and 2019 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2018 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 service and other revenues represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2020 service and other revenues did not change materially from 2019 2019 service and other revenues of 184 increased 278 percent from 2018 primarily reflecting an increased emphasis on this line of business and the impact of the blueline acquisition 

fourth quarter 2020 items  as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2020 we redeemed all of our 4 5  8 percent senior notes due 2025 using borrowings available under our abl facility upon redemption we recognized a loss of 24 in interest expense net reflecting the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes 

  fourth quarter 2019 items  in the fourth quarter of 2019 we issued 750 aggregate principal amount of 3 7  8 percent senior secured notes due 2027 and redeemed all of our 4 5  8 percent senior secured notes upon redemption we recognized a 

loss of 29 in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also completed the 125 billion share repurchase program that commenced in july 2018 

segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 were as follows 



general rentals for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 general rentals accounted for 75 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period for the year ended december 31 2020 general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit decreased by 453 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased by 310 basis points from 2019 with 240 basis points of the margin decline due to an increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue the increase in depreciation expense includes a 26 asset impairment charge which was not related to covid19 associated with the discontinuation of certain equipment programs excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge depreciation expense decreased slightly from 2019 but increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to covid19 as noted above covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 and since then equipment rentals have remained down yearoveryear in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions the remaining 70 basis point decline in equipment rentals gross margin was primarily due to the impact of covid19 partially offset by the impact of actions we have taken to manage operating costs such as the reduction of overtime and temporary labor and the leveraging of our current capacity to reduce the need for thirdparty delivery and repair services 

general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2019 increased by 114 primarily due to increased equipment rentals including the impact of the blueline acquisition as discussed above equipment rentals increased 117 percent as compared to 2018 primarily reflecting a 154 percent increase in average oec equipment rentals gross margin decreased 250 basis points from 2018 due primarily to the impact of the blueline acquisition and increased operating costs the blueline acquisition was a significant driver of the 177 percent depreciation increase which exceeded the equipment rentals increase of 117 percent operating costs were impacted by repair and repositioning initiatives that resulted in increased repairs and maintenance expense which increased 198 percent such increase includes the impact of both the blueline acquisition and the repair and repositioning initiatives 

trench power and fluid solutions  for the year ended december 31 2020 equipment rentals gross profit decreased by 35 and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 50 basis points from 2019 the increased gross margin primarily reflected decreases in certain operating costs including delivery repairs and labor partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and certain fixed expenses such as facility costs as a percentage of revenue as noted above we have reduced overtime and temporary labor primarily in response to the impact of covid19 and have leveraged our current capacity to reduce the need for thirdparty delivery and repair services depreciation expense was largely flat yearoveryear but increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to covid19 

for the year ended december 31 2019 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 130 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 280 basis points from 2018 the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 268 percent and average oec increased 360 percent primarily due to the impact of acquisitions including bakercorp and cold starts on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp equipment rental revenue increased 

128 percent yearoveryear primarily due to a 141 percent increase in average oec the decrease in the equipment rentals gross margin was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   



2020 gross margin of 373 percent decreased 190 basis points from 2019 equipment rentals gross margin decreased 220 basis points yearoveryear with 190 basis points of the margin decline due to an increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue depreciation expense included a 30 asset impairment charge which was not related to covid19 associated with the discontinuation of certain equipment programs excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge depreciation expense decreased slightly from 2019 but increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to covid19 as noted above covid19 began to impact our operations in march 2020 and since then equipment rentals have remained down yearoveryear in response to shelterinplace orders and other market restrictions the remaining 30 basis point decline in equipment rentals gross margin was primarily due to the impact of covid19 partially offset by the impact of actions we have taken to manage operating costs such as the reduction of overtime and temporary labor and the leveraging of our current capacity to reduce the need for thirdparty delivery and repair services gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 100 basis points from 2019 primarily due to lower margin sales of fleet acquired in the blueline acquisition in 2019 the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability and to varying degrees the impact of covid19 and such revenue types did not account for a significant portion of total gross profit gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2020 gross margin from service and other revenues was particularly impacted by covid19 which resulted in reduced training revenue without a proportionate reduction in costs 

2019 gross margin of 392 percent decreased 260 basis points from 2018 equipment rentals gross margin decreased 240 basis points yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions and increased operating costs the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions were significant drivers of the 197 percent depreciation increase which exceeded the equipment rentals increase of 148 percent operating costs were impacted by repair and repositioning initiatives that resulted in increased repairs and maintenance expense which increased 224 percent such increase includes the impact of both 1 the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions and 2 the repair and repositioning initiatives on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 41 percent primarily due to a 49 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 06 percent partially offset by the impact of inflation gross margin from sales of rental equipment decreased 420 basis points from 2018 primarily due to lower margin sales of fleet acquired in the blueline acquisition and changes in the mix of equipment sold and channel mix the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability and such margins did not have a significant impact on total gross margin gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2019 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2020   



sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily reflects significant reductions in professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses which were implemented in response to covid19 partially offset by increases in salaries and stock compensation as a percentage of revenue total salary and stock compensation expense was largely flat yearoveryear generally reflecting normal variability but increased as a percentage of revenue due in part to the covid19 impact on revenue the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily reflects a reduction in stock compensation as a percentage of revenue and decreased bad debt expense the reduced bad debt expense primarily reflects our adoption in 2019 of an updated lease accounting standard see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail this standard requires that we recognize doubtful accounts associated with lease revenues as a reduction to equipment rentals revenue such amounts were recognized as sga expense prior to 2019 

the merger related costs reflect transaction costs associated with the nes and neff acquisitions that were completed in 2017 and the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions that were completed in 2018 we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations the historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are rsc which had annual revenues of approximately 15 billion prior to the acquisition national pump which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to the acquisition nes which had annual revenues of approximately 369 prior to the acquisition neff which had annual revenues of approximately 413 prior to the acquisition bakercorp which had annual revenues of approximately 295 prior to the acquisition and blueline which had annual revenues of approximately 786 prior to the acquisition 

the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks the yearoveryear increase in nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily reflects the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed above 

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 included aggregate debt redemption losses of 183 and 61 respectively the debt redemption losses primarily reflect the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 172 percent yearoveryear primarily due to decreases in average debt and the average cost of debt excluding the impact of the 2019 losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2019 increased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of higher average debt the yearoveryear increase in average debt includes the impact of the debt used to finance the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed above 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act” was enacted the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods alternative minimum tax credit 

refunds modifications to the net interest deduction limitations technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property and deferral of employer payroll taxes the cares act did not materially impact our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 although it will impact the timing of future cash payments for taxes as of december 31 2020 we have deferred employer payroll taxes of 54 under the cares act with approximately half of the deferral due in each of 2021 and 2022 

balance sheet  accounts receivable net decreased by 215 or 141 percent from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 primarily due to decreased revenue which included the impact of covid19 prepaid expenses and other assets increased by 235 or 1679 percent from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 primarily due to deposits placed on rental equipment as of december 31 2020 as discussed further in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the 2020 capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 37 billion of holdings common stock under five completed share repurchase programs on january 28 2020 our board of directors authorized a new 500 share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 and was intended to run for 12 months through march 18 2020 when the program was paused due to the covid19 pandemic we repurchased 257 of common stock under the program we are currently unable to estimate when or if the program will be restarted and we expect to provide an update at a future date 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 202 cash equivalents at december 31 2020 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2020 



  

1 the outstanding amount of debt under the abl facility and the average outstanding amount are less than the maximum outstanding amount primarily due to the use of proceeds i from the issuance of 4 percent senior notes discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and ii from operations to reduce borrowings under the facility at the time of the 4 percent senior notes offering we indicated our expectation that we would reborrow an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering along with additional borrowings under the abl facility to redeem the 800 principal amount of our 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2025 on or after july 15 2020 prior to redeeming the 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2025 we considered the impact of covid19 on liquidity and assessed our available sources and anticipated uses of cash including with respect to sources cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment in august 2020 we redeemed the 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2025 as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan and in 2020 capital expenditures 

decreased significantly yearoveryear the decreased capital expenditures contributed to our ability to use proceeds from operations to reduce borrowings under the abl facility 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 25 2021 were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were 103 and 1301 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan which contributed to the yearoveryear decrease in net rental capital expenditures 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2020 specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl and term loan facilities and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2020 we i generated cash from operating activities of 2658 billion which included 300 of cash outflow for refundable deposits on expected rental equipment purchases as discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 900 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 1158 billion ii make debt payments net of proceeds of 1985 billion and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 286 during 2019 we i generated cash from operating activities of 3024 billion and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 868 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 2350 billion ii purchase other companies for 249 iii make debt payments net of proceeds of 418 and iv purchase shares of our common stock for 870 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of and plus proceeds from equipment the equipment purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2020 was 2440 billion an increase of 874 as compared to 1566 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 free cash flow increased primarily due to decreased net rental capital expenditures purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by reduced net cash provided by operating activities which included the impact of a 300 cash outflow in 2020 for refundable deposits on expected rental equipment purchases as discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements net rental capital expenditures decreased 1198 billion or 92 percent yearoveryear as discussed above disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our covid19 response plan which contributed to the yearoveryear decrease in net rental capital expenditures free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2019 was 1566 billion an increase of 295 as compared to 1271 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 free cash flow increased primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment net rental capital expenditures decreased 141 or 10 percent yearoveryear 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



  

 

1 the payments due with respect to a period represent i in the case of debt and finance leases the scheduled principal payments due in such period and ii in the case of operating leases the payments due in such period for noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further debt information and note 13 for further finance lease and operating lease information 

2 estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of december 31 2020 

3 these primarily represent service agreements with third parties to provide wireless and network services 

4 as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding advance purchase orders which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business with our equipment and inventory suppliers these purchase orders can generally be cancelled by us without cancellation penalties the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers pursuant to these purchase orders and the related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout 2021 the total above includes 300 for 

refundable deposits on expected rental equipment purchases as discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in 2020 due primarily to covid19 we canceled a significant portion of our purchase orders in the fourth quarter of 2020 we entered into a significant amount of purchase commitments which increased the obligations to levels that are consistent with historic obligations  the obligations above reflect our continuing assessment of the impact of covid19 which will also inform our future purchases 

5 the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted in december 2017 included a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits we have elected to pay the transition tax amount payable of 55 over an eightyear period the amount that we expect to pay as reflected in the table above represents the total we owe net of an overpayment of federal taxes which we are required to apply to the transition tax 

6 this information excludes 10 of unrecognized tax benefits it is not possible to estimate the time period during which these unrecognized tax benefits may be paid to tax authorities additionally we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” our selfinsurance reserves totaled 127 at december 31 2020 selfinsurance liabilities are based on estimates and actuarial assumptions and can fluctuate in both amount and in timing of cash settlement because historical trends are not necessarily predictive of the future and accordingly are not included in the table above 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 

information regarding guarantors of urna indebtedness 

urna is 100 percent owned by holdings and has certain outstanding indebtedness that is guaranteed by both holdings and with the exception of its us special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the company’s accounts receivable securitization facility the “spv” all of urna’s us subsidiaries the “guarantor subsidiaries” other than the guarantee by our canadian subsidiary of urnas indebtedness under the abl facility none of urna’s indebtedness is guaranteed by urnas foreign subsidiaries or the spv together the “nonguarantor subsidiaries” the receivable assets owned by the spv have been sold or contributed by urna to the spv and are not available to satisfy the obligations of urna or holdings’ other subsidiaries holdings consolidates each of urna and the guarantor subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements urna and the guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percentowned and controlled by holdings holdings’ guarantees of urna’s indebtedness are full and unconditional except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met the holdings guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws 

the guarantees of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries are made on a joint and several basis the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances including sale of the guarantor subsidiary the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiarys assets the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants or the notes being rated investment grade by both standard  poor’s ratings services and moody’s investors service inc or in certain circumstances another rating agency selected by urna like the holdings guarantees the guarantees of the guarantors subsidiaries are subject to subordination provisions to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws 

all of the existing guarantees by holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness the secured indebtedness of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries including guarantees of urna’s existing and future secured indebtedness will rank effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors the guarantees of urna’s indebtedness are effectively junior to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors including our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2020 indebtedness of our nonguarantors included i 634 of outstanding borrowings by the 

spv in connection with the company’s accounts receivable securitization facility ii 5 of outstanding borrowings under the abl facility by nonguarantor subsidiaries and iii 11 of finance leases of our nonguarantor subsidiaries 

covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the other agreements governing our debt impose operating and financial restrictions on urna holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries including limitations on the ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments as of december 31 2020 the amount available for distribution under the most restrictive of these covenants was 1060 billion the company’s total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of holdings as of december 31 2020 our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments which includes urna’s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of holdings was 4064 billion 

based on our understanding of rule 310 of regulation sx rule 310 we believe that holdings’ guarantees of urna indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in rule 310 which enable us to present summarized financial information for holdings urna and the consolidated guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with rule 1301 of regulation sx the summarized financial information excludes information regarding the nonguarantor subsidiaries in accordance with rule 310 separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented 

the summarized financial information of holdings urna and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis is as follows 






 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2020 we had an aggregate of 26 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2020 under these facilities as of december 31 2020 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 20 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2020 we had an aggregate of 71 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2020 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately seven percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11 see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  we operate in the us canada and europe in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets our presence in europe is limited and most of our foreign revenue and income is from canada during the year ended december 31 2020 our foreign subsidiaries accounted for 733 or 9 percent of our total revenue of 8530 billion and 83 or 7 percent of our total pretax income of 1139 billion 

based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the company as a whole we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 13 percent market share in north america based on 2019 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara estimated market share is calculated by dividing our total 2019 north american rental revenue by ara’s forecasted 2019 industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality 

our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

approximately 5700 of our employees are salaried and approximately 13400 are hourly collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 116 separate locations cover approximately 1350 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature an economic slowdown or a decrease in general economic activity could cause weakness in our end markets and have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our general rental equipment and trench power and fluid solutions equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2019  our total indebtedness was 114 billion our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2019  we had 35 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 31 percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a 

refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future and such indebtedness may be secured indebtedness the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness permit us to recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants or comply with other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

we rely on our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility to provide liquidity for our business including to fund capital expenditures acquisitions operating expenses and other liquidity needs the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2019  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant under the abl facility or the financial tests under the accounts receivable securitization facility or comply with any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility the term loan facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations future debt arrangements we enter into may contain similar provisions 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility term loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii indebtedness iii mergers consolidations and acquisitions iv sales transfers and other dispositions of assets v loans and other investments vi dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments vii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries viii transactions with affiliates and ix issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross 

acceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business 

results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes other indebtedness andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 



 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in january 2020 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 500 million excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses as of december 31 2019  we have completed all repurchases under the prior 125 billion program 

although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities also our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2019  we had 52 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include 

 we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 



 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under each of the abl facility and the term loan facility a change of control as defined in the applicable credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility or the term loan facility as applicable and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2020 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses 

insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers including tariffs on raw materials or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software employee error or malfeasance phishing attacks security breaches disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain which include cloudbased networks and data center storage 

we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks we are continuously developing and enhancing our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access this continued development and enhancement requires us to expend additional resources however we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits fines and other means of regulatory enforcement for example the general data protection regulation regulation eu 2016679 the “gdpr” which took full effect on may 25 2018 has caused european union “eu” data protection requirements to be more stringent and provides for greater penalties noncompliance with the gdpr can trigger fines of up to €20 million or 4 percent of annual worldwide revenue whichever is higher such failures could lead to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations in addition the requirements 

of the gdpr may necessitate changes to our existing business practices in order to comply with the gdpr or to address the concerns of our customers or business partners relating to the gdpr complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business further any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs in addition as environmental and safety regulations have tended to become stricter we could incur additional costs in complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future these include climate change regulation which could materially affect our operating results through increased compliance costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 1024 branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states and puerto rico which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 1350 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 17750 employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts 

to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states including in europe as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and europe are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk 

in addition on march 29 2017 the united kingdom the “uk” government triggered article 50 of the treaty on european union “brexit” this officially confirmed the uk’s intention to withdraw its membership from the eu and the start of a two year negotiation process where the uk and the eu need to agree the terms of the withdrawal and potentially give consideration to the future of the relationship between the parties on november 14 2018 the eu and the uk government agreed to the terms of a withdrawal agreement that required ratification by the uk and the european parliament ahead of the uk’s withdrawal on march 29 2019 the deadline for uk’s withdrawal has been subsequently extended to january 31 2020 however it remains unclear whether the withdrawal agreement or any alternative agreement will be finalized and ratified ahead of this revised deadline uncertainty over whether the uk will ultimately withdraw from the eu the timing for such withdrawal as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the uk and the eu could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results the longterm effects of brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the uk and the eu which may take years to complete and may include among other things greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity our operations in the uk and europe as well as our north american operations could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by brexit or the actual withdrawal by the uk from the eu if we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively our business could be adversely affected our operations in the eu represented an immaterial part of our business as of december 31 2019

tableend executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 1175 rental locations in the us canada and europe as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” of  146 billion and a north american branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the us the bakercorp acquisition discussed above added 11 european locations in france germany the united kingdom and the netherlands to our branch network our size also gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 4000 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2019  equipment rental revenues represented 85 percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2020  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2020  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to experience solid demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 3 percent with similar growth expected in the us and canada 

as discussed below fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates time utilization and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue the pro forma metrics below include the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline for the full year 2019  

 financial overview 

in 2019  we took the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business 

 as of december 31 2019  we had available liquidity of  2143 billion  including cash and cash equivalents of  52  

net income  net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 are presented below net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017 include a substantial benefit associated with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the enactment of the tax act resulted in an estimated net income increase for the year ended december 31 2017 of 689 or 805 per diluted share primarily due to a onetime revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a us federal tax rate of 21 percent which was partially offset by the impact of a onetime transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits which we elected to pay over an eightyear period the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and 2019 and 2018 reflect the lower tax rate the tax act is discussed further in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 



net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 include the aftertax impacts of the items below the tax rates applied to the items below reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entity the reduced tax rates for 2019 and 2018 reflect the enactment of the tax act 



  

 ebitda gaap reconciliations  ebitda represents the sum of net income provision benefit for income taxes interest expense net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the merger related costs restructuring charge stock compensation expense net and the impact of the fair value markup of acquired fleet these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies the ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins represent ebitda or adjusted ebitda divided by total revenue management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliations provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 

the table below provides a reconciliation between net income and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 



 for the year ended december 31 2019  ebitda increased  572  or 158 percent and adjusted ebitda increased  492  or 127 percent for the year ended december 31 2019  ebitda margin decreased 20 basis points to 449 percent and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 140 basis points to 466 percent as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of bakercorp and blueline in july 2018 and october 2018 respectively and the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases for 2019 include the impact of these acquisitions the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions 

for the year ended december 31 2018 ebitda increased 733 or 253 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 699 or 221 percent for the year ended december 31 2018 ebitda margin increased 150 basis points to 451 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 40 basis points to 480 percent as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes neff bakercorp and blueline in april 2017 october 2017 july 2018 and october 2018 respectively and ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2018 include the impact of these acquisitions the increase in the ebitda margin primarily reflects i a decrease in selling general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue and ii reduced merger related costs and restructuring charges the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects a decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 were as follows   



 



and october 2017 respectively the pro forma information includes the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs collectively these ancillary fees represented approximately 13 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2019  delivery and pickup revenue which represented approximately seven percent of equipment rental revenue in 2019  is the most significant ancillary revenue component sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

2019 total revenues of  94 billion increased 162 percent compared with 2018  equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types together they accounted for 94 percent of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  equipment rentals increased 148 percent primarily due to a 177 percent increase in average oec which includes the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 41 percent primarily due to a 49 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 06 percent partially offset by the impact of fleet inflation sales of rental equipment increased 252 percent primarily due to increased volume which included the impact of the blueline acquisition driven by a larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market 

2018 total revenues of  80 billion increased 212 percent compared with 2017 equipment rentals increased 214 percent primarily due to a 203 percent increase in average oec which included the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 105 percent primarily due to a 66 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 50 percent partially offset by the impact of inflation the fleet productivity increase reflected improving demand in many of our core markets sales of rental equipment increased 207 percent primarily due to increased volume driven by a significantly larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market as noted above average oec increased 203 percent which included the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we recognized total additions excluding acquisitions to our allowances for doubtful accounts of  42   45 and  40  respectively primarily 1 as a reduction to equipment rental revenue primarily for 2019 doubtful accounts associated with lease revenues or 2 as bad debt expense within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 

we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  187 or  243  respectively if the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  19  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  31 or  48  respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost market or income approach or a combination of certain of these methods depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks the estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates revenue growth rates operating margins terminal values useful lives and other prospective financial information goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions the significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital when appropriate our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired as well as the estimated life of the assets can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization and in certain instances through impairment charges if the asset becomes impaired in the future as discussed below we regularly review for impairments 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of 

management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in 2020 we will adopt accounting guidance that eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2018 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 52 percent as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which added 11 european locations to our branch network the european locations are in our fluid solutions europe reporting unit all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 7 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2019 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 32 percent as discussed above in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 12 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill we review the recoverability of our rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if there are such indications we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

in support of our review for indicators of impairment we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance and conclude whether indicators of impairment exist associated with our longlived assets including rental equipment we also specifically review the financial performance of our rental equipment such review includes an estimate of 

the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment or property and equipment 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

we have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no taxes have been provided on such earnings we continue to evaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and have not changed our previous indefinite reinvestment determination following the enactment of the tax act discussed above we have not repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs nor do we anticipate the need to do so the tax act required a onetime transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax act in 2018 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings if we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities this segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and fluid solutions segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates 

construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the fluid solutions and iv fluid solutions europe regions both of which rent equipment primarily used for fluid containment transfer and treatment the trench power and fluid solutions segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada and europe 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our eleven geographic regions—carolinas gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic mid central midwest northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for the five year period ended december 31 2019  three of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 22 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period for the five year period ended december 31 2019  the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was western canada the western canada regions equipment rentals gross margin of 332 percent for the five year period ended december 31 2019 was 22 percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the western canada regions equipment rentals gross margin was less than the other general rentals regions during this period primarily due to declines in the oil and gas business in the region the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and fluid solutions segment the trench power and fluid solutions segment includes the locations acquired in the july 2018 bakercorp acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as such there is not a long history of the acquired locations rental margins included in the trench power and fluid solutions segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and fluid solutions segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis the historic preacquisition margins for the acquired bakercorp locations are lower than the margins achieved at the other locations in the segment we expect that the margins at the acquired locations will increase as we realize synergies following the acquisition as a result of which we expect future margin convergence 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter

segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 were as follows 



general rentals for the three years in the period ended december 31 2019  general rentals accounted for 77 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2019 increased by  114  primarily due to increased equipment rentals including the impact of the blueline acquisition as discussed above equipment rentals increased 117 percent as compared to 2018  primarily reflecting a 154 percent increase in average oec equipment rentals gross margin decreased 250 basis points from 2018  due primarily to the impact of the blueline acquisition and increased operating costs the blueline acquisition was a significant driver of the 177 percent depreciation increase which exceeded the equipment rentals increase of 117 percent operating costs were impacted by repair and repositioning initiatives that resulted in increased repairs and maintenance expense which increased 198 percent such increase includes the impact of both the blueline acquisition and the repair and repositioning initiatives 

general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2018 increased 343 primarily due to increased equipment rentals including the impact of the nes neff and blueline acquisitions equipment rentals increased 174 percent as compared to 2017 primarily reflecting a 179 percent increase in average oec on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff and blueline equipment rental revenue increased 73 percent yearoveryear primarily due to a 55 percent increase in average oec equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2017 

trench power and fluid solutions  for the year ended december 31 2019  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  130 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 280 basis points from 2018  the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 268 percent and average oec increased 360 percent primarily due to the impact of acquisitions including bakercorp and cold starts on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp equipment rental revenue increased 128 percent yearoveryear primarily due to a 141 percent increase in average oec the decrease in the equipment rentals gross margin was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions 

for the year ended december 31 2018 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 180 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 140 basis points from 2017 the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 407 percent and average oec increased 430 percent the decrease in the equipment rentals gross margin includes the impact of the bakercorp acquisition and mix changes in particular fuel revenue which generates lower margins increased the historic preacquisition margins for the acquired bakercorp locations are lower than the margins achieved at the other locations in the segment we expect that the margins at the acquired locations will increase as we realize synergies following the acquisition 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   



2019 gross margin of 392 percent decreased 260 basis points from 2018  equipment rentals gross margin decreased 240 basis points yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions and increased operating costs the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions were significant drivers of the 197 percent depreciation increase which exceeded the equipment rentals increase of 148 percent operating costs were impacted by repair and repositioning initiatives that resulted in increased repairs and maintenance expense which increased 224 percent such increase includes the impact of both 1 the blueline and bakercorp acquisitions and 2 the repair and repositioning initiatives on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp and blueline equipment rentals increased 41 percent primarily due to a 49 percent increase in average oec and a fleet productivity increase of 06 percent partially offset by the impact of inflation gross margin from sales of rental equipment decreased 420 basis points from 2018 primarily due to lower margin sales of fleet acquired in the blueline acquisition and changes in the mix of equipment sold and channel mix the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability and such margins did not have a significant impact on total gross margin gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2019  

2018 gross margin of 418 percent increased 10 basis points equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2017 gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 190 basis points primarily reflecting improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability and such margins did not have a significant impact on total gross margin gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2018 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2019    



sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily reflects a reduction in stock compensation as a percentage of revenue and decreased bad debt expense the reduced bad debt expense primarily reflects our adoption in 2019 of an updated lease accounting standard see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail this new standard requires that we recognize doubtful accounts associated with lease revenues as a reduction to equipment rentals revenue such amounts were recognized as sga expense prior to 2019 the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue 

the merger related costs reflect transaction costs associated with the nes and neff acquisitions that were completed in 2017 and the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations the historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are rsc which had annual revenues of approximately 15 billion prior to the acquisition and national pump which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to the acquisition nes had annual revenues of approximately 369 and neff had annual revenues of approximately 413 as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements bakercorp had annual revenues of approximately 295 and blueline had annual revenues of approximately 786 

the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2017 included aggregate losses of 61 and 54  respectively associated with debt redemptions and the amendments of our abl facility excluding the impact of the 2019 losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2019 increased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of higher average debt the yearoveryear increase in average debt includes the impact of the debt used to finance the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed above excluding the impact of the 2017 losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2018 increased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of higher average debt the yearoveryear increase in average debt includes the impact of the debt used to finance the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed above 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements as discussed further in note 14  the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 includes the substantial impact of the enactment of the tax act discussed above the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 reflect the decreased tax rate 

balance sheet as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statement in 2019 we adopted an updated lease accounting standard that resulted in the recognition of operating lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities we adopted this standard using a transition method that does not require application to periods prior to adoption accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 70  or 103 percent from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019  due partially to the accounting for operating leases under the updated accounting standard accrued expenses and other liabilities as of december 31 2019 includes 178 of current operating lease liabilities excluding the impact of the operating lease liabilities accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased primarily due to an increase in anticipated income tax refunds accounts payable decreased by 82  or 153 percent from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 primarily due to the timing of i invoice payments and ii payroll taxes see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion addressing our deferred tax liability 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the 2019 capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 37 billion of holdings common stock under five completed share repurchase programs additionally in january 2020 our board authorized a new 500 share repurchase program which will commence in the first quarter of 2020 we intend to complete the new program over twelve months our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of  52  cash equivalents at december 31 2019 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2019  



we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 27 2020 were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  130 billion and  144 billion in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2019  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl and term loan facilities and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2019  we i generated cash from operating activities of  302 billion and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  868  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  235 billion  ii purchase other companies for  249  iii make debt payments net of proceeds of  418 and iv purchase shares of our common stock for 870  during 2018 we i generated cash from operating activities of 285 billion ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 687 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 224 billion we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 229 billion ii purchase other companies for 297 billion and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 817 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of and plus proceeds from equipment the equipment purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2019 was  1566 billion  an increase of  295 as compared to  1271 billion for the year ended december 31 2018  free cash flow increased primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment net rental capital expenditures purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment decreased  141  or 10 percent yearoveryear free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2018 was 1271 billion an increase of 364 as compared to 907 for the year ended december 31 2017 free cash flow increased primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental and nonrental equipment net rental capital expenditures increased 223 or 18 percent yearoveryear 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2019

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2019  we had an aggregate of  35 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2019 under these facilities as of december 31 2019  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  27 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2019  we had an aggregate of  79 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2019 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11 see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  we operate in the us canada and europe as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets our presence in europe is limited and most of our foreign revenue and income is from canada during the year ended december 31 2019  our foreign subsidiaries accounted for  817  or 9 percent of our total revenue of  9351 billion  and  62  or 4 percent of our total pretax income of  1514 billion  based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the company as a whole we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and operates throughout the united states and canada and has a limited presence in europe the table below presents key information about our business as of and for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  our business is discussed in more detail below the data below should be read in conjunction with and is qualified by reference to our management’s discussion and analysis and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we completed the acquisitions of nes rentals holdings ii inc “nes” neff corporation neff bakercorp international holdings inc “bakercorp” and vander holding corporation and its subsidiaries blueline in april 2017 october 2017 july 2018 and october 2018 respectively the results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline subsequent to their acquisition 

dates are reflected in the table below 

1 as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of bakercorp and blueline in july 2018 and october 2018 respectively estimated market share as of december 31 2018 includes the standalone preacquisition revenues of bakercorp and blueline as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes and neff in april 2017 and october 2017 respectively estimated market share as of december 31 2017 includes the standalone preacquisition revenues of nes and neff estimated market share as of december 31 2017 does not include bakercorp and blueline because we had not acquired them as of december 31 2017  if the standalone preacquisition revenues of bakercorp and blueline were included for the year ended december 31 2017  estimated market share as of december 31 2017 would have been 129 percent 

strategy 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2019  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 industry overview and economic outlook 

united rentals serves the following three principal end markets for equipment rental in north america industrial and other nonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential construction which includes remodeling as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets the acquisition added 11 european locations in france germany the united kingdom and the netherlands to our branch network in 2018  based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

 we estimate that based on industry estimates from the american rental association ara  2018 north american equipment rental industry revenue grew approximately 7 percent yearoveryear with higher growth on a constant currency basis in the us than canada in 2018  our full year rental revenue increased by 214 percent yearoveryear including the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline equipment rental revenue increased 105 percent yearoveryear 

in 2019  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to experience solid demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 6 percent with slightly higher growth on a constant currency basis in the us than canada 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment we believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repair and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet the optimum time to dispose of an asset 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence national accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least 500000 or customers doing business in multiple states we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs national accounts are a subset of key accounts which are our accounts that are managed by a single point of contact establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

 our information technology systems  some of which are proprietary and some of which are licensed support our operations our information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of information technology specialists that supports our systems

   our foreign operations are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions for additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements

equipment rental  we offer for rent approximately 3800 classes of rental equipment on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms trench safety equipment power and hvac equipment fluid solutions equipment and general tools and light equipment 

sales of rental equipment  we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment consistent with the lifecycle approach we use to manage our fleet the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the market for used equipment the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand 

we utilize many channels to sell used equipment through our national and export sales forces which can access many resale markets across our network at auction through brokers and directly to manufacturers we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale 

sales of new equipment  we sell equipment such as aerial lifts reach forklifts telehandlers compressors and generators from many leading equipment manufacturers the type of new equipment that we sell varies by location 

contractor supplies sales  we sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies 

service and other revenues  we offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers 

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including television trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local and national promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 133 percent market share in north america based on 2018 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of bakercorp and blueline in july 2018 and october 2018 respectively estimated market share includes the standalone preacquisition revenues of bakercorp and blueline and is calculated by dividing total 2018 rental revenue calculated using ara’s constant currency methodology by ara’s forecasted 2018 industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

approximately 5700 of our employees are salaried and approximately 12800 are hourly collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 120 separate locations cover approximately 1350 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature an economic slowdown or a decrease in general economic activity could cause weakness in our end markets and have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our general rental equipment and trench power and fluid solutions equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2018  our total indebtedness was 117 billion our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 



 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2018  we had 35 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 30 percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or other agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

the only financial maintenance covenant that currently exists under our abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2018  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility the term loan facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility term loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility term loan facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii saleleaseback transactions iii indebtedness iv mergers consolidations and acquisitions v sales transfers and other dispositions of assets vi loans and other investments vii dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments viii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries ix transactions with affiliates and x issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in 

addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes other indebtedness andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic 

conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in april 2018 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 125 billion excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses we have completed  420 million of repurchases under the program as of december 31 2018  

although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities also our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2018  we had 51 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly 

reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include 

 we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in 

addition under each of the abl facility and the term loan facility a change of control as defined in the applicable credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility or the term loan facility as applicable and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2019 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers including tariffs on raw materials or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software employee error or malfeasance phishing attacks security breaches disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain which include cloudbased networks and data center storage 

we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks we are continuously developing and enhancing our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access this continued development and enhancement requires us to expend additional resources however we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits fines and other means of regulatory enforcement for example the general data protection regulation regulation eu 2016679 the “gdpr” which took full effect on may 25 2018 has caused european union “eu” data protection requirements to be more stringent and provides for greater penalties noncompliance with the gdpr can trigger fines of up to €20 million or 4 percent of annual worldwide revenue whichever is higher such failures could lead to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations in addition the requirements of the gdpr may necessitate changes to our existing business practices in order to comply with the gdpr or to address the concerns of our customers or business partners relating to the gdpr complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business further any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental 

compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 1038 branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states and puerto rico which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 1350 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 17150 employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our 

projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states including in europe as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and europe are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk 

in addition on march 29 2017 the united kingdom the “uk” government triggered article 50 of the treaty on european union “brexit” this officially confirmed the uk’s intention to withdraw its membership from the eu and the start for a two year negotiation process where the uk and the eu need to agree the terms of the withdrawal and potentially give consideration to the future of the relationship between the parties current uncertainty over whether the uk will ultimately leave the eu as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the uk and the eu could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results the longterm effects of brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the uk and the eu which may take years to complete may include among other things greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity our operations in the uk and europe as well as our north american operations could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by brexit or the actual withdrawal by the uk from the eu if we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively our business could be adversely affected our operations in the eu represented an immaterial part of our business as of december 31 2018

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 1197 rental locations in the us canada and europe as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities with the recently completed acquisition of bakercorp discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which added 11 european locations in france germany the united kingdom and the netherlands to our branch network we entered into select european markets although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  142 billion and a north american branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the us in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3800 classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2018  equipment rental revenues represented 86 percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2019  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2019  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to experience solid demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 6 percent with slightly higher growth on a constant currency basis in the us than canada 

we use the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes neff bakercorp and blueline in april 2017 october 2017 july 2018 and october 

2018 respectively the pro forma metrics below include the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline for the full year 2018  

 financial overview 

in 2018 and 2017  we took a number of actions related to our capital structure that have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity including 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital to take advantage of business opportunities as of december 31 2018  we had available liquidity of  1432 billion  including cash of  43  

net income  net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018 are presented below net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017 include a substantial benefit associated with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the enactment of the tax act resulted in an estimated net income increase for the year ended december 31 2017 of 689 or 805 per diluted share primarily due to a onetime revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a us federal tax rate of 21 percent which was partially offset by the impact of a onetime transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits which we elected to pay over an eightyear period the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent which contributed an estimated 236 to diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2018  the tax act is discussed further in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 



net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018 include the aftertax impacts of the items below the tax rates applied to the adjustments items below reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entity the reduction in the tax rate for 2018 reflects the enactment of the tax act 



  

 ebitda gaap reconciliations  ebitda represents the sum of net income provision benefit for income taxes interest expense net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the merger related costs restructuring charge stock compensation expense net and the impact of the fair value markup of acquired fleet these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies the ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins represent ebitda or adjusted ebitda divided by total revenue management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliations provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 

the table below provides a reconciliation between net income and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 



 for the year ended december 31 2018  ebitda increased  733  or 253 percent and adjusted ebitda increased  699  or 221 percent for the year ended december 31 2018  ebitda margin increased 150 basis points to 451 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 40 basis points to 480 percent as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes neff bakercorp and blueline in april 2017 october 2017 july 2018 and october 2018 respectively and ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2018 include the impact of these acquisitions the increase in the ebitda margin primarily reflects i a decrease in selling general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue and ii reduced merger related costs and restructuring charges the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects a decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2017 ebitda increased 230 or 86 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 405 or 147 percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals partially offset by i increased sga compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards and ii increased merger related costs and restructuring charges associated with the nes and neff acquisitions the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased sga compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue and improved profitability for the year ended december 31 2017 ebitda margin decreased 270 basis points to 436 percent and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 30 basis points to 476 percent the decrease in the ebitda margin primarily reflects i increased sga compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards and ii increased merger related costs and restructuring charges associated with the nes and neff acquisitions the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased sga compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue and improved profitability partially offset by increased profit from sales of rental equipment 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018 were as follows   



 



 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs collectively these ancillary fees represented approximately 12 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2018  delivery and pickup revenue which represented approximately seven percent of equipment rental revenue in 2018  is the most significant ancillary revenue component sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

2018 total revenues of  80 billion increased 212 percent compared with 2017  on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline 2018 total revenues increased 107 percent the revenue increase primarily reflects i a 214 percent increase in equipment rental revenue primarily due to an 188 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions and a 22 percent rental rate increase and ii a 207 percent increase in sales of rental equipment on the pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline equipment rental revenue increased 105 percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 69 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 26 percent rental rate increase we believe that the increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates reflect improving demand in many of our core markets sales of rental equipment increased primarily due to increased volume driven by a significantly larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market average oec for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 203 percent yearoveryear the increase in average oec includes the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions 

2017 total revenues of 66 billion increased 153 percent compared with 2016 on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff 2017 total revenues increased 77 percent the revenue increase primarily reflected a 157 percent increase in equipment rental revenue primarily due to an 182 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions partially offset by a 02 percent rental rate decrease on the pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff equipment rental revenue increased 76 percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 71 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 04 percent rental rate increase we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflected improving demand in many of our core markets sales of rental equipment increased 109 percent primarily due to increased volume sales of new equipment increased 236 percent primarily due to increased volume and increased sales of larger equipment 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straightline basis we account for such rentals as operating leases our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days this daily rate assumes that the equipment will be on rent for the full 28 days as we are unsure of when the customer will return the equipment and therefore unsure of which rental contract period will apply 

as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straightline methodology for instance continuing the 

above example if the customer rented the above piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay or 300 at the weekly rate and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis or 12856 which represents four days at 3214 per day 

we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of 56 and 46 as of december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the ancillary fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs delivery and pickup revenue is the most significant ancillary revenue component and is recognized when the service is performed 

revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds during the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  we recognized expenses of  45   40 and  24  respectively primarily within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income associated with our allowances for doubtful accounts 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  150 or  189  respectively if the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  16  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  28 or  43  respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost market or income approach or a combination of certain of these methods depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks the estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates revenue growth rates operating margins terminal values useful lives and other prospective financial information goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired as well 

as the estimated life of the assets can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization and in certain instances through impairment charges if the asset becomes impaired in the future as discussed below we regularly review for impairments 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we are currently assessing whether we will early adopt accounting guidance that eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test this guidance becomes effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2017 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 45 percent 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2018 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our fluid solutions europe reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 52 percent as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which added 11 european locations to our branch network the european locations are in our fluid solutions europe reporting unit all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were acquired in the bakercorp acquisition the estimated fair value of our fluid solutions europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 7 percent as all of the assets in the fluid solutions europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the july 2018 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the fluid solutions europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill we review the recoverability of our rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if there are such indications we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  

in support of our review for indicators of impairment we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance we also review the financial performance of our rental equipment in our rental equipment review we estimate the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment or property and equipment 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

the tax act discussed above which was enacted in december 2017 had a substantial impact on our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the year ended december 31 2018 reflects the decreased tax rate see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

we have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no taxes have been provided on such earnings we continue to evaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and have not changed our previous indefinite reinvestment determination following the enactment of the tax act we have not repatriated funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs nor do we anticipate the need to do so the tax act requires a onetime transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments as of december 31 2018  we have computed a transition tax amount payable of  62  of which  14 was included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to settle the remaining payable amount by applying an overpayment of federal taxes 

we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings if we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state income taxes beyond the tax acts onetime transition tax 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements our two reportable segments are i general rentals and ii trench power and fluid solutions the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and fluid solutions segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the fluid solutions and iv fluid solutions europe regions both of which rent equipment primarily used for fluid containment transfer and treatment the trench power and fluid solutions segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada and europe 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our eleven geographic regions—carolinas gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic mid central midwest northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment we periodically review the size and geographic scope of our regions and have occasionally reorganized the regions to create a more balanced and effective structure historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for the five year period ended december 31 2018  three of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 13 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated 

we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and fluid solutions segment the trench power and fluid solutions segment includes the locations acquired in the july 2018 bakercorp acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as such there is not a long history of the acquired locations rental margins included in the trench power and fluid solutions segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and fluid solutions segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis the historic preacquisition margins for the acquired bakercorp locations are lower than the margins achieved at the other locations in the segment we expect that the margins at the acquired locations will increase as we realize synergies following the acquisition as a result of which we expect future margin convergence 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   



equipment rentals 2018 equipment rentals of  69 billion increased  12 billion or 214 percent as compared to 2017  primarily reflecting an 188 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions and a 22 percent rental rate increase  on a pro forma basis including the standalone 

preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline equipment rental revenue increased 105 percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 69 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 26 percent rental rate increase we believe that the increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates reflect improving demand in many of our core markets equipment rentals represented 86 percent of total revenues in 2018  

on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 85 percent and 93 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  823  or 174 percent as compared to 2017  primarily reflecting a 165 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes neff and blueline acquisitions and increased rental rates on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff and blueline the volume of oec on rent increased 55 percent we believe that the increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates reflect improving demand in many of our core markets trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased  402  or 407 percent primarily reflecting a 465 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of bakercorp the volume of oec on rent increased 233 percent the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects improved performance in our fluid solutions and power and hvac regions the improvement in the fluid solutions region reflects growth in revenue from upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant volatility in recent years additionally due in part to the upstream oil and gas volatility we have sought to diversify our revenue mix to achieve a reduced portion of business tied to oil and gas we have diversified outside of oil and gas and have grown our revenue from most of our non oil and gas customers for example industrial construction and mining customers the power and hvac region experienced growth in revenue from oil and gas and nonresidential construction customers 

2017 equipment rentals of 57 billion increased 774 or 157 percent as compared to 2016 primarily reflecting an 182 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions partially offset by a 02 percent rental rate decrease on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff equipment rental revenue increased 76 percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 71 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 04 percent rental rate increase we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflected improving demand in many of our core markets equipment rentals represented 86 percent of total revenues in 2017 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 85 percent and 92 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and fluid solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 561 or 135 percent as compared to 2016 primarily reflecting a 169 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff the volume of oec on rent increased 55 percent we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflected improving demand in many of our core markets trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 213 or 275 percent primarily reflecting a 349 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent trench power and fluid solutions average oec increased 143 percent the increase in the volume of oec on rent significantly exceeded the increase in average oec primarily due to improved performance in our fluid solutions region the improvement in the fluid solutions region primarily reflected growth in revenue from i upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant volatility in recent years and ii construction and mining customers 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  sales of rental equipment represented approximately 8 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2018 sales of rental equipment of  664 increased 207 percent from 2017 primarily reflecting increased volume driven by a significantly larger fleet size in a strong used equipment market average oec for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 203 percent yearoveryear 2017 sales of rental equipment of 550 increased 109 percent from 2016 primarily reflecting increased volume 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  sales of new equipment represented approximately 3 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2018 sales of new equipment of  208 increased 169 percent from 2017 primarily reflecting increased volume driven partially by some larger sales 2017 sales of new equipment of 178 increased 236 percent from 2016 primarily reflecting increased volume and increased sales of larger equipment 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2018 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2017  and 2017 sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2016 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  service and other revenues represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2018 service and other revenues of  144 increased 220 percent from 2017 primarily reflecting an increased emphasis on this line of 

business 2017 service and other revenues of 118 increased 157 percent from 2016 primarily reflecting the impact of the nes acquisition and an increased emphasis on this line of business 

fourth quarter 2018 items  the fourth quarter of 2018 includes  22 of merger related costs and  16 of restructuring charges primarily associated with the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018  we entered into a 1 billion senior secured term loan facility and issued 11 billion principal amount of 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2026 as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the proceeds from the 6 1  2 percent senior notes and borrowings under the term loan facility were used to finance the acquisition of blueline in october 2018 

  fourth quarter 2017 items  the fourth quarter of 2017 includes an estimated benefit of 689 associated with the enactment of the tax act discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements the fourth quarter of 2017 also includes 18 of merger related costs and 22 of restructuring charges primarily associated with the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 we redeemed the remaining 225 principal amount of our 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 upon the redemption of these notes we recognized a loss of 11 in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflects a yearoveryear increase of 11 in stock compensation expense primarily due to the impact of increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards 

segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018 were as follows   



general rentals for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  general rentals accounted for 80 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2018 increased  343  and equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2017  time utilization was 694 percent and 702 percent for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in time utilization primarily reflected the impact of the nes neff and blueline acquisitions the impact of the decreased time utilization on equipment rentals gross margin was offset by the impact of increased rental rates the volume of oec on rent increased 165 percent  including the impact of the nes neff and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff and blueline the volume of oec on rent increased 55 percent and time utilization was flat we believe that the increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates reflect improving demand in many of our core markets 

general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2017 increased 225 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 10 basis points time utilization increased 90 basis points and was 702 percent and 693 percent for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively in 2017 we saw improving demand in many of our core markets as evidenced by a 169 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff the volume of oec on rent increased 55 percent 

trench power and fluid solutions  for the year ended december 31 2018  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  180 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 140 basis points from 2017  the increase in equipment rentals gross profit 

primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 407 percent average oec increased 430 percent and the volume of oec on rent increased 465 percent the decrease in the equipment rentals gross margin includes the impact of the bakercorp acquisition and mix changes in particular fuel revenue which generates lower margins increased the historic preacquisition margins for the acquired bakercorp locations are lower than the margins achieved at the other locations in the segment we expect that the margins at the acquired locations will increase as we realize synergies following the acquisition 

for the year ended december 31 2017 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 126 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 260 basis points from 2016 primarily reflecting increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and fluid solutions equipment rentals increased 275 percent average oec increased 143 percent and the volume of oec on rent increased 349 percent the increase in the volume of oec on rent significantly exceeded the increase in average oec primarily due to improved performance in our fluid solutions region the improvement in the fluid solutions region primarily reflected growth in revenue from i upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant volatility in recent years and ii construction and mining customers 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   



2018 gross margin of 418 percent increased 10 basis points equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2017 primarily reflecting a 22 percent rental rate increase offset by a 90 basis point decrease in time utilization time utilization was 686 percent and 695 percent for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in time utilization primarily reflected the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions the volume of oec on rent increased 188 percent including the impact of the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes neff bakercorp and blueline the volume of oec on rent increased 69 percent rental rates increased 26 percent and time utilization increased 20 basis points we believe that the increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates reflect improving demand in many of our core markets gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 190 basis points primarily reflecting improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability and such margins did not have a significant impact on total gross margin gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2018  

2017 gross margin of 417 percent was flat with 2016 equipment rentals gross margin increased 40 basis points primarily reflecting a 160 basis point increase in time utilization partially offset by a 02 percent rental rate decrease time utilization was 695 percent and 679 percent for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively time utilization for 2017 was a fullyear record the volume of oec on rent increased 182 percent including the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff the volume of oec on rent increased 71 percent and rental rates increased 04 percent we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflected improving demand in many of our core markets gross margin from sales of new equipment decreased 280 basis points sales of new equipment increased 236 percent primarily reflecting increased volume and increased sales of larger equipment some of which were at lower margins gross margin from service and other revenues decreased 980 basis points in 2017 as a result of our increased focus on the service line of business we increased the allocation of labor to it such labor costs were formerly included in cost of equipment rentals 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2018    



sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects a reduction in salaries and bonuses as a percentage of revenue 

the increase in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily reflects increased compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards 

the merger related costs reflect transaction costs associated with the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations the historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are rsc which had annual revenues of approximately 15 billion prior to the acquisition and national pump which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to the acquisition as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements nes had annual revenues of approximately 369 neff had annual revenues of approximately 413 bakercorp had annual revenues of approximately 295 and blueline had annual revenues of approximately  786  

the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs in the third quarter of 2018 we initiated a restructuring program following the closing of the bakercorp acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the restructuring program also includes actions undertaken associated with the blueline acquisition that is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks the yearoveryear increase in nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily reflects the impact of the neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 included aggregate losses of 54 and 101  respectively associated with debt redemptions and the amendments of our abl facility excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2018 increased yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of higher average debt the yearoveryear increase in average debt includes the impact of the debt used to finance the nes neff bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2017 was flat yearoveryear as the impact of higher average debt was offset by a lower average cost of debt 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements as discussed further in note 13  the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 includes the substantial impact of the enactment of the tax act discussed above the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the year ended december 31 2018 reflects the decreased tax rate 

balance sheet accounts receivable net increased by 312  or 253 percent from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 primarily due to increased revenue which included the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements rental equipment net increased by 1776 billion  or 227 percent and property and equipment net increased by 147  or 315 percent from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018  primarily due to the impact of the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in response to a strong operating environment accounts payable increased by 127  or 311 percent from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 primarily due to the timing of payments in december 2018 we had one fewer checkpaying days than in december 2017 and december 2018 also included one less pay period than december 2017 accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 141  or 263 percent from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 primarily due to i increased income taxes payable due to an overpayment of federal taxes that significantly reduced taxes payable as of december 31 2017  and ii increased interest payable due in part to the debt used to finance the bakercorp and blueline acquisitions see notes 9  12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussions addressing our goodwill and other intangible assets debt and deferred tax liability respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the capital structure actions taken in 2018 and 2017 to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 245 billion of holdings common stock under four completed share repurchase programs additionally in april 2018 our board authorized a 125 billion share repurchase program which commenced in july 2018 as of december 31 2018  we have repurchased 420 of holdings common stock under the 125 billion share repurchase program which we intend to complete in 2019 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of  43  cash equivalents at december 31 2018 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2018  



 

 we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for 

information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 21 2019 were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  144 billion and 122 billion in 2018 and 2017  respectively 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial maintenance covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2018  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl facility the term loan facility and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2018  we i generated cash from operating activities of  285 billion  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  687 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  224 billion  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  229 billion  ii purchase other companies for  297 billion and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 817  during 2017 we i generated cash from operating activities of  221 billion  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 566 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 159 billion we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 189 billion ii purchase other companies for 238 billion iii purchase shares of our common stock for 56 and iv pay financing costs of 44 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of and plus proceeds from equipment and plus excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements the equipment purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2018 was  127 billion  an increase of  364 as compared to  907 for the year ended december 31 2017  free cash flow increased primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental and nonrental equipment net rental capital expenditures purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment increased  223  or 18 percent yearoveryear free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2017 was 907 a decrease of 275 as compared to 118 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased purchases of rental equipment partially offset by increased cash provided by operating activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2018  we had an aggregate of  35 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2018 under these facilities as of december 31 2018  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  26 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2018  we had an aggregate of  82 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2018 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11 see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  we operate in the us canada and europe as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in july 2018 we completed the acquisition of bakercorp which allowed for our entry into select european markets during the year ended december 31 2018  our foreign subsidiaries accounted for  660  or 8 percent of our total revenue of  8047 billion  and  71  or 5 percent of our total pretax income of  1476 billion  based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the company as a whole we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including television trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local and national promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 114  percent market share based on 2017  total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes and neff in april 2017 and october 2017 respectively estimated market share includes the standalone preacquisition revenues of nes and neff and is calculated by dividing total 2017  rental revenue calculated using ara’s constant currency methodology by ara’s forecasted 2017  industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as 

 7 

the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature an economic slowdown or a decrease in general economic activity could cause weakness in our end markets and have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our general rental equipment and trench power and pump equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2017  our total indebtedness was 94  billion our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 



 8 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2017  we had 24  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 25  percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

the only financial maintenance covenant that currently exists under our abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2017  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio 

 9 

and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any of the other relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii saleleaseback transactions iii indebtedness iv mergers consolidations and acquisitions v sales transfers and other dispositions of assets vi loans and other investments vii dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments viii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries ix transactions with affiliates and x issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 10 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 



 11 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 1 billion excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses in october 2016 we paused repurchases under the program as we evaluated a number of potential acquisition opportunities as discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements we completed the acquisitions of nes in april 2017 and neff in october 2017 in october 2017 our board authorized the resumption of the 1 billion share repurchase program and we intend to complete the program in 2018 the company had completed  655 million  of repurchases under the program as of december 31 2017 

although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to 

 12 

enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2017  we had 41  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7amanagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include 



 13 

 we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful 

 14 

moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2018  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or 

 15 

the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software phishing attacks security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks additionally we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 874  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 1100  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 13700  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the union 

 16 

represented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 997  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  115  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3400  classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2017  equipment rental revenues represented 86  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2018  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2018  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to experience solid demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 4  percent with slightly higher growth on a constant currency basis in the us than canada 

we use the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec as discussed above we completed the acquisitions of nes and neff in april 2017 and october 2017 respectively the pro forma metrics below include the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff for the full year 2017

 financial overview 

in 2017  and 2016  we took a number of positive actions related to our capital structure that have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity including 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital to take advantage of business opportunities as of december 31 2017  we had available liquidity of  171 billion  including cash of  352  

net income  net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  are presented below net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017  include a substantial benefit associated with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the act the enactment of the act resulted in an estimated net income increase of  689  or  805  per diluted share primarily due to a onetime revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a us federal tax rate of 21 percent which was partially offset by the impact of a onetime transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits which we will elect to pay over an eightyear period we expect to meaningfully benefit from the act in future periods primarily due to the impact of the lower us federal tax rate

 for the year ended december 31 2017  ebitda increased  230  or 86  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  405  or 147  percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals partially offset by i increased selling general and administrative sga compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards and ii increased merger related costs and restructuring charges associated with the nes and neff acquisitions the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased sga compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue and improved profitability for the year ended december 31 2017  ebitda margin decreased 270  basis points to 436  percent and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 30  basis points to 476  percent the decrease in the ebitda margin primarily reflects i increased sga compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards and ii increased merger related costs and restructuring charges associated with the nes and neff acquisitions the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased sga compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions increased revenue and improved profitability partially offset by increased profit from sales of rental equipment 

for the year ended december 31 2016 ebitda decreased 109 or 39 percent and adjusted ebitda decreased 73 or 26 percent the ebitda decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and the impact of the merger credit recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 associated with a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets the adjusted ebitda decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment for the year ended december 31 2016 ebitda margin decreased 140 basis points to 463 percent and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 80 basis points to 479 percent the decrease in the ebitda margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals and the impact of the national pump merger credit recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  were as follows   



 



 26 

 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs collectively these ancillary fees represented approximately 12  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2017  delivery and pickup revenue which represented approximately seven  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2017  is the most significant ancillary revenue component sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

2017  total revenues of  66  billion increased 153  percent compared with 2016  on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff 2017  total revenues increased 77  percent the revenue increase primarily reflects a 157  percent increase in equipment rental revenue primarily due to an 182  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions partially offset by a 02  percent rental rate decrease on the pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff equipment rental revenue increased 76  percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 71  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 04  percent rental rate increase we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects improving demand in many of our core markets sales of rental equipment increased 109  percent primarily due to increased volume sales of new equipment increased 236  percent primarily due to increased volume and increased sales of larger equipment 

2016 total revenues of 58 billion decreased 09 percent compared with 2015 the revenue decrease primarily reflects a 78 percent decrease in sales of rental equipment due primarily to a decrease in the volume of equipment sold through wholesale channels rental revenue decreased 02 percent primarily due to a 22 percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a 31 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 02 percent yearoveryear 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straightline basis we account for such rentals as operating leases our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days this daily rate assumes that the equipment will be on rent for the full 28 days as we are unsure of when the customer will return the equipment and therefore unsure of which rental contract period will apply 

as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straightline methodology for instance continuing the above example if the customer rented the above piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay or 300 at the weekly rate and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis or 12856 which represents four days at 3214 per day 

 27 

we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  38  and 33 as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the ancillary fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent for fuel and for environmental costs delivery and pickup revenue is the most significant ancillary revenue component and is recognized when the service is performed 

revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized expenses of  40   24  and  32  respectively within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income associated with our allowances for doubtful accounts 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  10  18 and 30 for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  127  or  160  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  14  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  23  or  35  respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements and customer relationships goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements and customer relationships are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires 

 28 

judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test as discussed in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements we expect to adopt accounting guidance that eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test when it becomes effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2016 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 53  percent the estimated fair value of our pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 15  percent given the relatively small percent by which the pump solutions reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying amount we further tested the pump solution reporting unit for impairment by performing a sensitivity test that included a reduction in the longterm growth rate and an increase in the discount rate the pump solutions reporting unit passed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test we continue to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment and the pump solution reporting unit’s operating results improved significantly in 2017 as evidenced in its fair value exceeding its carrying value by 62  percent in the goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2017 

 29 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2017 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 45  percent 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct an impairment review of rental assets as part of this impairment review we estimate the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly review there was no impairment associated with our rental assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted in december 2017 had a substantial impact on our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  we expect to meaningfully benefit from its enactment in future periods see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

 30 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements our two reportable segments are i general rentals and ii trench power and pump the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and pump segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the pump solutions region which rents pumps primarily used by energy and petrochemical customers the trench power and pump segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our eleven  geographic regions—carolinas gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic mid central midwest northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment we periodically review the size and geographic scope of our regions and have occasionally reorganized the regions to create a more balanced and effective structure historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for the five year period ended december 31 2017  one  of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 12  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and pump segment the pump solutions region is primarily comprised of locations acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition as such there isn’t a long history of the pump solutions regions rental margins included in the trench power and pump segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and pump segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   

 31 



equipment rentals 2017  equipment rentals of  57  billion increased  774  or 157  percent as compared to 2016  primarily reflecting an 182  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions partially offset by a 02  percent rental rate decrease on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff equipment rental revenue increased 76  percent yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 71  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 04  percent rental rate increase we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects improving demand in many of our core markets equipment rentals represented 86  percent of total revenues in 2017  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 85  percent and 92  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  561  or 135  percent as compared to 2016  primarily reflecting a 169 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions on a pro forma basis including the standalone preacquisition results of nes and neff the volume of oec on rent increased 55  percent we believe that the increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects improving demand in many of our core markets trench power and pump equipment rentals increased  213  or 275  percent primarily reflecting a 349  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent trench power and pump average oec increased 143  percent the increase in the volume of oec on rent significantly exceeded the increase in average oec primarily due to improved performance in our pump solutions region the improvement in the pump solutions region primarily reflected growth in revenue from i upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant volatility in recent years and ii construction and mining customers 

2016 equipment rentals of 49 billion decreased 8 or 02 percent as compared to 2015 the equipment rentals decrease was primarily due to a 22 percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a 31 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 02 percent yearoveryear equipment rentals represented 86 percent of total revenues in 2016 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 85 percent and 91 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased 75 or 18 percent as compared to 2015 primarily reflecting decreased rental rates partially offset by a 29 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 67 or 95 percent primarily reflecting increased average oec trench power and pump average oec for 2016 increased 67 percent as compared to 2015 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  sales of rental equipment represented approximately 9  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2017   

 32 

sales of rental equipment of  550   increased   109  percent from 2016  primarily reflecting increased volume 2016 sales of rental equipment of 496 decreased slightly from 2015 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  sales of new equipment represented approximately 3  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2017  sales of new equipment of  178   increased   236  percent from 2016  primarily reflecting increased volume and increased sales of larger equipment 2016 sales of new equipment of 144 decreased slightly from 2015 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2017  sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2016  and 2016 sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2015 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  service and other revenues represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales 2017  service and other revenues of  118   increased   157  percent from 2016  primarily reflecting the impact of the nes acquisition discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements and an increased emphasis on this line of business 2016 service and other revenues of 102 increased slightly from 2015 

fourth quarter 2017  items  the fourth quarter of 2017 includes an estimated benefit of  689  associated with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act discussed further in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements the fourth quarter of 2017  also includes  18  of merger related costs and  22  of restructuring charges primarily associated with the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 we redeemed the remaining  225  principal amount of our 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 upon the redemption of these notes we recognized a loss of  11  in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflects a yearoveryear increase of  11  in stock compensation expense primarily due to the impact of increased revenue improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards 

  fourth quarter 2016  items  the fourth quarter of 2016 includes 6 of restructuring charges associated with the restructuring program we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 which is discussed further in note 5  to our consolidated financial statements additionally in the fourth quarter of 2016 we redeemed 850 principal amount of our 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 and issued 750 principal amount of 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2027 upon the partial redemption of the 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 we recognized a loss of 65 in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes 

  segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  were as follows   



general rentals  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  general rentals accounted for 82  percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2017  increased  225  and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 10  basis points time utilization increased 90  basis points and was 702  percent and 693  percent for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively in 2017  we saw improving demand in many of our core markets as evidenced by a 169 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent which includes the impact of the nes and

general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2016 decreased 94 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 150 basis points primarily reflecting decreased rental rates partially offset by a 70 basis point increase in time utilization time utilization was 693 percent and 686 percent for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from canada and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion although we experienced rate pressures during 2016 we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets as evidenced by a 29 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent 

trench power and pump  for the year ended december 31 2017  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  126  and equipment rentals gross margin increased 260  basis points from 2016  primarily reflecting increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet yearoveryear trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 275  percent average oec increased 143  percent and the volume of oec on rent increased 349  percent the increase in the volume of oec on rent significantly exceeded the increase in average oec primarily due to improved performance in our pump solutions region the improvement in the pump solutions region primarily reflected growth in revenue from i upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant volatility in recent years and ii construction and mining customers 

for the year ended december 31 2016 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 36 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 70 basis points from 2015 the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet across a larger network of branches yearoveryear trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 95 percent and average oec increased 67 percent capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench power and pump segment has been a key component of our strategy in recent years

other costsincome

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2017    



sga expense  primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the increase in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily reflects increased compensation costs including stock compensation costs largely due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements improved profitability and increases in our stock price and in the volume of stock awards 

sga expense for the year ended december 31 2016 did not change significantly yearoveryear 

the merger related costs  reflect transaction costs associated with the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements and the april 2014 national pump acquisition we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations the historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are rsc which had annual revenues of approximately 15 billion prior to the acquisition and national pump which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to the acquisition as discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements nes had annual revenues of approximately 369 and neff had annual revenues of approximately 413 the merger related costs for the year ended december 31 2017  include a termination fee we paid associated with a merger agreement neff entered into with a prior bidder the income for the year ended december 31 2015 reflects a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets 

the restructuring charges  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs in the second quarter of 2017 we initiated a restructuring program following the closing of the nes acquisition discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements the restructuring program also includes actions undertaken associated with project xl which is a set of eight specific work streams focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability through cost savings across our business and the neff acquisition that is discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements see note 5  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization  includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships and noncompete agreements 

interest expense net  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  includes aggregate losses of 54  101  and 123  respectively associated with debt redemptions and the amendments of our abl facility excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2017  was flat yearoveryear as the impact of higher average debt was offset by a lower average cost of debt excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased primarily due to lower average debt and a lower average cost of debt 

the decrease in other income net  for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily reflects decreased gains on sales of nonrental equipment

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates  to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements as discussed further in note 13  the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  includes the substantial impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act 

balance sheet  accounts receivable net increased by 313  or 340  percent from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  primarily due to increased revenue which included the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements rental equipment net increased by 1635 billion  or 264  percent from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  primarily due to the impact of the nes and neff acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in response to a strong operating environment accounts payable increased by 166  or 683  percent from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  primarily due to increased capital expenditures in response to a strong operating environment accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 192  or 558  percent from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  primarily due to i increased incentive compensation accruals associated with improved profitability and ii increased accrued interest expense primarily due to the debt issued to partially finance the acquisitions of nes and neff as discussed in note 12  to the consolidated financial statements see notes 12  and 13  to the consolidated financial statements for discussions addressing our debt and deferred tax liability respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the capital structure actions taken in 2017  and 2016  to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 1450 billion of holdings common stock under three completed share repurchase programs additionally in july 2015 our board authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program in october 2016 we paused repurchases under the program as we evaluated potential acquisition opportunities as discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements we completed the acquisitions of nes in april 2017 and neff in october 2017 in october 2017 our board authorized the resumption of the share repurchase program and we intend to complete the program in 2018 as of january 22 2018  we have repurchased 701 of holdings common stock under the 1 billion share repurchase program 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of  352  cash equivalents at december 31 2017  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2017  



 



 36 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 22 2018  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  122 billion  and 750  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial maintenance covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent  of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2017  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this financial maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl facility and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2017  we i generated cash from operating activities of  223 billion  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  566  and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  159 billion  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  189 billion  ii purchase other companies for  238 billion  iii purchase shares of our common stock for 56  and iv pay financing costs of 44  during 2016 we i generated cash from operating activities of 195 billion and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 510 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 134 billion ii purchase shares of our common stock for 528 and iii make debt payments net of proceeds of 471 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available 

 37 

to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2017  was  907  a decrease  of  275  as compared to  118 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased purchases of rental equipment partially offset by increased cash provided by operating activities as discussed in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements we adopted accounting guidance in 2017 that changed the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements in the table above the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements for 2017 are presented as a component of net cash provided by operating activities while for 2016 and 2015 they are presented as a separate line item because we historically included the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements in the free cash flow calculation the adoption of this guidance did not change the calculation of free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2016 was 118 billion an increase of 263 as compared to 919 for the year ended december 31 2015 free cash flow increased primarily due to decreased purchases of rental equipment 

in 2018 we expect free cash flow of approximately 13 billion to 14 billion as discussed further in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted in december 2017 we expect that our future free cash flow will meaningfully benefit from the act primarily due to i the lower us federal tax rate of 21  percent and ii the full expensing of capital spending the combined impact of which we expect to materially exceed the impact of iii the repeal of likekind exchange provisions which had allowed for the deferral of taxable gains on the sale of used equipment 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2017

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2017  we had an aggregate of  24 billion  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility see liquidity and capital resources above for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2017  under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2017  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  14  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2017  we had an aggregate of  71  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2017  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately seven  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11  see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2017  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 6 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

service and other revenues  we offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers 

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including television trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local and national promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 97  percent market share based on 2016  total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ara our estimated market share is based on our total 2016  rental revenue calculated using ara’s constant currency methodology divided by ara’s forecasted 2016  industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

approximately 3900  of our employees are salaried and approximately 8600  are hourly collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 80  separate locations cover approximately 850  of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

 7 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature an economic slowdown or a decrease in general economic activity could cause weakness in our end markets and have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our general rental equipment and trench power and pump equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2016  our total indebtedness was 78  billion our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 



 8 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2016  we had 22  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 28  percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2016  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result the maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the 

 9 

delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any of the other relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii saleleaseback transactions iii indebtedness iv mergers consolidations and acquisitions v sales transfers and other dispositions of assets vi loans and other investments vii dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments viii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries ix transactions with affiliates and x issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis including potential growth opportunities for our trench power and pump specialty business from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached by other public companies or large privatelyheld companies to explore consolidation opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future with respect to our specialty business or otherwise or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

 10 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 



 11 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 1 billion excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses in october 2016 we paused repurchases under the program as we evaluated a number of potential acquisition opportunities as discussed in note 18  to the consolidated financial statements on january 25 2017 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with nes rentals holdings ii inc “nes” pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire nes in an all cash transaction we intend to complete the share repurchase program however we will reevaluate the decision to do so as we integrate nes and assess other potential uses of capital 

although the board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market 

 12 

liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2016  we had 33  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of the goodwill impairment testing for our pump solutions reporting unit see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7amanagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include 



 13 

 we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

 14 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2017  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system 

we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and service online orders in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software phishing attacks security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain we have from time to time experienced threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks additionally we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could lead to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 769  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 850  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 11650  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially 

 16 

lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 887  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  90  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3200  classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2016  equipment rental revenues represented 86  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2017  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2017  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to experience solid demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 4  percent with similar growth on a constant currency basis expected in both the us and canada 

we use the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec for the full year 2016

for the year ended december 31 2016  ebitda decreased  109  or 39  percent and adjusted ebitda decreased  73  or 26  percent the ebitda decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and the impact of the merger credit recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 associated with a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets the adjusted ebitda decrease primarily reflects decreased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment for the year ended december 31 2016  ebitda margin decreased 140  basis points to 463  percent and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 80  basis points to 479  percent the decrease in the ebitda margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals and the impact of the national pump merger credit recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects decreased margins from equipment rentals 

for the year ended december 31 2015 ebitda increased 175 or 67 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 114 or 42 percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals decreased selling general and administrative expense and reduced merger costs associated with a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals for the year ended december 31 2015 ebitda margin increased 200 basis points to 477 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 90 basis points to 487 percent the increase in the ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals improved selling general and administrative leverage and reduced merger costs the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  were as follows   



 

 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel collectively these ancillary fees represented about 12  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2016  delivery and pickup revenue which represented about seven  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2016  is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or rpp revenue rpp revenue which represented about two  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2016  is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer and consumption if any can be measured sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales 

 26 

2016  total revenues of  58  billion decreased 09  percent compared with 2015  the revenue decrease primarily reflects a 78  percent decrease in sales of rental equipment due primarily to a decrease in the volume of equipment sold through wholesale channels rental revenue decreased 02  percent primarily due to a 22  percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a 31  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 02  percent yearoveryear 

2015 total revenues of 58 billion increased 23 percent compared with 2014 as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the revenue increase primarily reflects a 27 percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 32 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency and a 05 percent rental rate increase partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 43 percent yearoveryear 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days this daily rate assumes that the equipment will be on rent for the full 28 days as we are unsure of when the customer will return the equipment and therefore unsure of which rental contract period will apply 

as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straightline methodology for instance continuing the above example if the customer rented the above piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay or 300 at the weekly rate and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis or 12856 which represents four days at 3214 per day 

we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  33  and 32 as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel delivery and pickup revenue is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or rpp revenue rpp revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer and consumption if any can be measured 

revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

 27 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  18  30 and 39 for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  88  or  110  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  10  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  20  or  30  respectively 

acquisition accounting  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could 

 28 

materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2015 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 51 percent in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized discount rates of 100 percent for our general rentals segment and trench safety and power and hvac reporting units and 135 percent for our pump solutions reporting unit as well as a longterm terminal growth rate for all reporting units of 30 percent beyond our planning period 

most of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed above based on the october 1 2015 test the pump solutions reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 33 percent in light of continuing pressures on the pump solutions reporting unit related primarily to upstream oil and gas customers we continued to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment through the end of 2015 and performed another impairment test as of november 30 2015 as of the november 30 2015 testing date the estimated fair value of the pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 1 percent no additional impairment indicators were noted as of december 31 2015 

given the narrow margin by which the estimated fair value of the pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount we also performed a sensitivity analysis related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate used in the november 30 2015 test specifically we performed the sensitivity analysis by i increasing the discount rate by 50 basis points and ii reducing the longterm growth rate by 25 basis points the pump solutions reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test and would have required step two testing to determine potential goodwill impairment we continued to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment following the november 30 2015 test 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2016 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 53  percent the estimated fair value of our pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 15  percent 

for the goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2016 for our pump solutions reporting unit we utilized a discount rate of 140  percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30  percent beyond our planning period the improvement in the margin by which the pump solutions reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount in the october 1 2016 test as compared to the november 30 2015 test primarily reflects i a reduction in the pump solutions reporting unit’s carrying value primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of its assets as well as a reduction in its working capital and ii improvement in the pump solutions reporting unit’s revenue mix in its long term forecast largely due to having a smaller portion of revenue attributable to upstream oil and gas customers which have experienced significant 

 29 

volatility in recent years and a larger portion of revenue attributable to downstream oil and gas construction municipality and mining customers we also performed a sensitivity analysis related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate used in the october 1 2016 test by i increasing the discount rate by 50 basis points and ii reducing the longterm growth rate by 25 basis points the pump solutions reporting unit passed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test the october 1 2016 impairment test assumed earnings growth for the pump solutions reporting unit over the next 10  years should this growth not occur if the reporting unit otherwise fails to meet its current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumption used in the test the pump solutions reporting unit could fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in a future period as of december 31 2016 there was  312  of goodwill in the pump solutions reporting unit we will continue to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct an impairment review of rental assets as part of this impairment review we estimate the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly review there was no impairment associated with our rental assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment vehicles or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

 30 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs

as discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements our two reportable segments are i general rentals and ii trench power and pump the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and pump segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the pump solutions region which rents pumps primarily used by energy and petrochemical customers the trench power and pump segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our nine  geographic regions—industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic midwest northeast pacific west southcentral south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment we periodically review the size and geographic scope of our regions and have occasionally reorganized the regions to create a more balanced and effective structure historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for the five year period ended december 31 2016  one  of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 12  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry and monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and pump segment the pump solutions region is primarily comprised of locations acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed below as such there isn’t a long history of the pump solutions regions rental margins included in the trench power and pump segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and pump segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   

 31 



equipment rentals 2016  equipment rentals of  49  billion decreased  8  or 02  percent as compared to 2015  the equipment rentals decrease was primarily due to a 22  percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a 31  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 02  percent yearoveryear equipment rentals represented 86  percent of total revenues in 2016  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 85  percent and 91  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased  75  or 18  percent as compared to 2015  primarily reflecting decreased rental rates partially offset by a 29 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency trench power and pump equipment rentals increased  67  or 95  percent primarily reflecting increased average oec trench power and pump average oec for 2016  increased 67  percent as compared to 2015  

2015 equipment rentals of 49 billion increased 01 billion or 27 percent as compared to 2014 as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the equipment rentals increase was primarily due to a 32 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency and a 05 percent rental rate increase partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 43 percent yearoveryear equipment rentals represented 85 percent of total revenues in 2015 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased slightly yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 23 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency general rentals rental revenue would have increased 17 percent yearoveryear trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 111 or 186 percent primarily reflecting increased average oec partially offset by decreased time utilization due to the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above the locations acquired in the national pump acquisition experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers trench power and pump average oec for 2015 increased 34 percent including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above as compared to 2014 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  sales of rental equipment represented approximately 9  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these 

 32 

sales 2016  sales of rental equipment of  496   decreased  slightly from 2015  and 2015 sales of rental equipment of 538 decreased slightly from 2014 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  sales of new equipment represented approximately 3  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2016  sales of new equipment of  144   decreased  slightly from 2015  and 2015 sales of new equipment of 157 increased slightly from 2014 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2016  sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2015  and 2015 sales of contractor supplies decreased slightly from 2014 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  service and other revenues represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2016  service and other revenues of  102   increased  slightly from 2015  and 2015 service and other revenues of 94 increased slightly from 2014 

fourth quarter 2016  items  the fourth quarter of 2016  includes  6  of restructuring charges associated with the restructuring program we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 which is discussed further in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements additionally as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2016  we redeemed  850  principal amount of our 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 and issued  750  principal amount of 5 1  2 percent senior notes due 2027 upon the partial redemption of the 7 5  8 percent senior notes due 2022 we recognized a loss of  65  in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes 

  fourth quarter 2015  items  the fourth quarter of 2015 includes a decrease in stock compensation net of 14 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower than expected revenue and profitability additionally as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2015 we initiated a restructuring program in response to recent challenges in our operating environment though we expected solid industry growth in 2016 the restructuring program was initiated in an effort to reduce costs in an environment with continuing pressures on volume and pricing we recognized 4 of costs for the program in the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed the restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2016 additionally during the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached agreement on a settlement that provided us with a 5 refund on previously paid property taxes we recognized a reduction of 5 in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation associated with the settlement during the fourth quarter of 2015 additionally our provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 includes the impact of a 5 increase in valuation allowances resulting from the enactment of connecticut state limitations on net operating loss utilization during the nine months ended september 30 2015 we recognized 57 of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of cash flows the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements resulted from stockbased compensation windfall deductions in excess of the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes such benefits are recognized as a credit to additional paidin capital and are reported as financing cash flows our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended september 30 2015 included a 57 increase to financing cash flows and a corresponding decrease to operating cash flows associated with the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2015 52 of the previously recognized excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements were reversed due to the impact on taxable income of a bonus tax depreciation bill that passed in the fourth quarter of 2015 the reversal of the previously recognized excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements resulted in a 52 increase to operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 

  segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  were as follows   

 33 



general rentals  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  general rentals accounted for 84  percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2016  decreased  94  and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 150  basis points primarily reflecting decreased rental rates partially offset by a 70  basis point increase in time utilization time utilization was 693  percent and 686  percent for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from canada and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion although we experienced rate pressures during 2016  we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets as evidenced by a 29 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent 

general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2015 increased 29 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 50 basis points primarily reflecting cost improvements partially offset by a 90 basis point decrease in time utilization as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 05 percent delivery costs decreased 32 percent and compensation costs decreased 34 percent time utilization was 686 percent and 695 percent for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively during the year ended december 31 2015 our locations with significant exposure to upstream oil and gas experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers which was a primary driver of the decrease in time utilization 

trench power and pump  for the year ended december 31 2016  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  36  and equipment rentals gross margin increased 70  basis points from 2015  the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a larger fleet across a larger network of branches yearoveryear trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 95  percent and average oec increased 67  percent capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench power and pump segment has been a key component of our strategy in recent years 

for the year ended december 31 2015 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 26 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 430 basis points from 2014 the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a significantly larger fleet at our locations excluding the pump solutions region discussed below at our locations excluding the pump solutions region as compared to 2014 equipment rentals revenue increased approximately 21 percent average oec increased approximately 28 percent and equipment rentals gross profit increased approximately 24 percent the decrease in equipment rentals gross margin primarily reflects decreased margins in the pump solutions region which experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers the aggregate equipment rentals gross margin in the trench power and pump segment excluding the pump solutions region increased by approximately 130 basis points from 2014 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   

 34 



2016  gross margin of 417  percent decreased 90  basis points as compared to 2015  primarily reflecting decreased gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin decreased 110  basis points as compared to 2015  primarily reflecting a 22  percent rental rate decrease partially offset by a 60  basis point increase in time utilization time utilization was 679  percent and 673  percent for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the decreased rental rates reflected continued pressure from oil and gas and from canada and the impact of recent industry fleet expansion although we experienced rate pressures during 2016  we also saw improving demand in many of our core markets as evidenced by a 31  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent gross margin from sales of rental equipment decreased 110  basis points primarily due to decreased pricing 

2015 gross margin of 426 percent decreased slightly as compared to 2014 equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2014 primarily reflecting a 05 percent rental rate increase and compensation cost improvements offset by a 150 basis point decrease in time utilization time utilization was 673 percent and 688 percent for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively during the year ended december 31 2015 the locations acquired in the national pump acquisition and our other locations with significant exposure to upstream oil and gas experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers which was a primary driver of the decrease in time utilization as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 27 percent compensation costs were flat with 2014 gross margin from sales of new equipment decreased 290 basis points primarily due to changes in the mix of equipment sold gross margin from service and other revenues decreased 400 basis points primarily due to increased revenue from training activities which generate lower margins than our other service revenues 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2016    



sga expense  primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead sga expense for the year ended december 31 2016  did not change significantly yearoveryear 

the decrease in sga expense for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily reflects decreased incentive compensation costs associated with lower than expected revenue and profitability the impact of increased bad debt expense was largely offset by cost improvements throughout sga bad debt expense increased primarily due to improved receivable aging in 2014 which reduced the expense for year ended december 31 2014 the improvement in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily reflects decreased incentive compensation costs 

 35 

the merger related costs  primarily reflect financial and legal advisory fees and changes subsequent to the acquisition date to the fair value of the contingent cash consideration we paid associated with the april 2014 national pump acquisition the income for the year ended december 31 2015 reflects a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets 

the restructuring charges  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our previously closed restructuring programs and the restructuring program that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 the branch closure charges primarily reflect continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities the income for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflects buyouts or settlements of real estate leases for less than the recognized reserves see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization  includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks 

interest expense net  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014 includes aggregate losses of 101  123  and 80  respectively associated with debt redemptions and the amendments of our abl facility excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2016  decreased primarily due to lower average debt and a lower average cost of debt excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased primarily due to a lower average cost of debt partially offset by the impact of increased average outstanding debt 

the decrease in other income net  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily reflects decreased gains on sales of nonrental equipment 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates  to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

balance sheet  prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by 55  or 474  percent from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  primarily due to an income tax refund received in 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the capital structure actions taken in 2016  and 2015  to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 1450 billion of holdings common stock under three completed share repurchase programs additionally in july 2015 our board authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program in october 2016 we paused repurchases under the program as we evaluated a number of potential acquisition opportunities as of january 23 2017  we have repurchased 627 of holdings common stock under the 1 billion share repurchase program as discussed in note 18  to the consolidated financial statements on january 25 2017 we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire nes in an all cash transaction we intend to complete the share repurchase program however we will reevaluate the decision to do so as we integrate nes and assess other potential uses of capital 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of  312  cash equivalents at december 31 2016  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2016  

 36 



 

 we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v share repurchases and vi acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 23 2017  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  075 billion  and  100 billion  in 2016  and 2015  respectively 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent  of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2016  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this maintenance covenant is inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain 

 37 

financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl facility and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2016  we i generated cash from operating activities of  195 billion  and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  510  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  134 billion  ii purchase shares of our common stock for 528  and iii make debt payments net of proceeds of  471  during 2015 we i generated cash from operating activities of 20 billion ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 555 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 84 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 164 billion ii purchase other companies for 86 iii purchase shares of our common stock for 789 and iv pay 52 of contingent consideration associated with the national pump acquisition during 2015 cash also decreased by 29 due to the effect of foreign exchange rates 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2016  was  118 billion  an increase  of  263  as compared to 919  for the year ended december 31 2015  free cash flow increased primarily due to decreased purchases of rental equipment the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements result from stockbased compensation windfall deductions in excess of the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes such benefits are recognized as a credit to additional paidin capital and are reported as financing cash flows we added the excess tax benefits back to our calculation of free cash flow to generally classify cash flows from income taxes as operating cash flows however these excess tax benefits did not impact free cash flow for years ended december 31 2016  or 2015 as they do not result in increased cash flows until the associated income taxes are settled free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2015 was 919 an increase of 362 as compared to 557 for the year ended december 31 2014 free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 includes aggregate cash payments of 5 and 17 respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and decreased purchases of rental equipment 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2016

 relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 

holdings receives royalties from urna and its subsidiaries based upon a percent of revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 the royalty percent of revenue the royalty rate increased from two and a half percent to eight percent resulting in holdings receiving increased royalties from urna during the year ended december 31 2015 see note 17  to our consolidated financial statements the royalty rate increased as a result of a reassessment of the benefit provided by holdings trademark and its business support to urna and its subsidiaries the increase in the royalty rate results in increased intercompany receivables for holdings our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of holdings as of december 31 2016  our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments which includes urna’s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of holdings was  713

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of  22 billion  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility see liquidity and capital resources above for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2016  under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2016  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  14  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

 39 

at december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of  56  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2016  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 10  see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2016  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 5 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

strategy 

 2 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2016  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 industry overview and economic outlook 

united rentals serves the following three principal end markets for equipment rental in north america industrial and other nonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential construction which includes remodeling in 2015  based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

 we estimate that in 2015  north american equipment rental industry revenue grew approximately 6  percent yearoveryear the estimated industry growth reflects growth of approximately 7  percent and 1  percent in the us and canada respectively on a constant currency basis in 2015  we increased our full year rental revenue by approximately 27  percent yearoveryear excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 43  percent yearoveryear our rental revenue performance reflects volume and pricing pressure on our general rental business and our pump solutions region associated with upstream oil and gas customers 

in 2016  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to recover and drive demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 6  percent the expected industry growth reflects growth of approximately 7  percent and 1  percent in the us and canada respectively on a constant currency basis 

competitive advantages 

 3 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment we believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repair and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet the optimum time to dispose of an asset 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors

our principal products and services are described below 

 5 

equipment rental  we offer for rent approximately 3300  classes of rental equipment on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms trench safety equipment power and hvac equipment pumps and general tools and light equipment 

sales of rental equipment   we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment consistent with the lifecycle approach we use to manage our fleet the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the market for used equipment the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand 

we utilize many channels to sell used equipment through our national and export sales forces which can access many resale markets across our network at auction through brokers and directly to manufacturers we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale 

sales of new equipment  we sell equipment such as aerial lifts reach forklifts telehandlers compressors and generators from many leading equipment manufacturers the type of new equipment that we sell varies by location 

contractor supplies sales  we sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies 

service and other revenues  we offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers 

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area 

erentals  our customers can request equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week by accessing our equipment catalog and used equipment listing which can be found at  wwwunitedrentalscom  our customers can also use our ur control ®  application to actively manage their rental process and access realtime reports on their business activity with us

integrated into the customers enterprise resource planning system total control ®  is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong longterm relationships with our larger customers 

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including television trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 117  percent market share based on 2015  total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the american rental association ara our estimated market share is based on our total 2015  rental revenue calculated using ara’s constant currency methodology divided by ara’s forecasted 2015  industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

approximately 4000  of our employees are salaried and approximately 8700  are hourly collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 79  separate locations cover approximately 850  of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not 

 7 

presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature and the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 and the resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge an economic slowdown or a decrease in general economic activity could have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our general rental equipment and trench power and pump equipment are used in connection with private nonresidential construction and industrial activities which are cyclical in nature our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2015  our total indebtedness was 82  billion our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

  8 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2015  we had 22  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 26  percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility since the march 2015 amendment of the abl facility through december 31 2015  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result the maintenance covenant was inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain 

 9 

financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any of the other relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on i liens ii saleleaseback transactions iii indebtedness iv mergers consolidations and acquisitions v sales transfers and other dispositions of assets vi loans and other investments vii dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments viii dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries ix transactions with affiliates and x issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis including potential growth opportunities for our trench power and pump specialty business from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future with respect to our specialty business or otherwise or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

 10 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

  11 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our recently announced share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 1 billion excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses currently we intend to complete the share repurchase program within 18 months of its initiation in november 2015 

although the board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may 

 12 

decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2015  we had 32  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results for a discussion of the goodwill impairment testing for our pump solutions reporting unit see “critical accounting policiesevaluation of goodwill impairment” in part ii item 7amanagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include

 we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive 

 14 

pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2016  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on 

 15 

the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software phishing attacks security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain we may not anticipate or combat all types of attacks until after they have already been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 775  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 850  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 11850  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 897  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  87  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3300  classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2015  equipment rental revenues represented 85  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2016  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2016  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to recover and drive demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 6  percent the expected industry growth reflects growth of approximately 7  percent and 1  percent in the us and canada respectively on a constant currency basis 

in april 2014 we acquired certain assets of the following four entities national pump  compressor ltd canadian pump and compressor ltd gulfco industrial equipment lp and ld services llc collectively “national pump” the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date national pump was the second largest specialty pump rental company in north america and was a leading supplier of pumps

we use the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec for the full year 2015  we achieved 

 financial overview 

in 2015  and 2014  we took a number of positive actions related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery as of december 31 2015  we had available liquidity of  110 billion  including cash of  179  

net income  net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  were as follows

 for the year ended december 31 2015  ebitda increased  175  or 67  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  114  or 42  percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals decreased selling general and administrative expense and reduced merger costs associated with a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals for the year ended december 31 2015  ebitda margin increased 200  basis points to 477  percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 90  basis points to 487  percent the increase in the ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals improved selling general and administrative leverage and reduced merger costs the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

for the year ended december 31 2014 ebitda increased 418 or 192 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 425 or 185 percent the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases include the impact of the national pump acquisition discussed above the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases primarily reflect increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2014 ebitda margin increased 170 basis points to 457 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 150 basis points to 478 percent the increases in the ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins primarily reflect increased margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  were as follows   



 

 

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel collectively these ancillary fees represented about 12  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2015  delivery and pickup revenue which represented about seven  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2015  is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or rpp revenue rpp revenue which represented about two  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2015  is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer 

 26 

and consumption if any can be measured sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales 

2015  total revenues of  58  billion increased 23  percent compared with 2014  as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the revenue increase primarily reflects a 27  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 32  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency and a 05  percent rental rate increase partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 43  percent yearoveryear 

2014 total revenues of 57 billion increased 147 percent compared with 2013 as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the revenue increase reflects a 148 percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to increases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2014 the favorable impact of changes in the mix of equipment rented including the impact of the acquisition of national pump was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2014 reflected improvements in our operating environment and the execution of our strategy additionally sales of rental equipment increased 110 percent primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days this daily rate assumes that the equipment will be on rent for the full 28 days as we are unsure of when the customer will return the equipment and therefore unsure of which rental contract period will apply 

as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straightline methodology for instance continuing the above example if the customer rented the above piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay or 300 at the weekly rate and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis or 12856 which represents four days at 3214 per day 

we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  32  and 36 as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel delivery and pickup revenue is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or 

 27 

rpp revenue rpp revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer and consumption if any can be measured 

revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  30  39 and 44 for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  92  or  117  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  10  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  18  or  27  respectively 

purchase price allocation  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past including the national pump acquisition discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements and may continue to make acquisitions in the future the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions within our industry

including our own acquisitions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies within our industry including our own acquisitions 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2014 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 63 percent all of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed above the estimated fair value of our pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 13 percent as all of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the april 2014 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the pump solutions reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized a discount rate of 90 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2015  we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 51  percent in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized discount rates of 100 percent for our general rentals segment and trench safety and power and hvac reporting units and 135 percent for our pump solutions reporting unit as well as a longterm terminal growth rate for all reporting units of 30 percent beyond our planning period 

most of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed above based on the october 1 2015 test the pump solutions reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount 

 29 

by 33  percent in light of continuing pressures on the pump solutions reporting unit related primarily to upstream oil and gas customers we continued to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment through the end of 2015 and performed another impairment test as of november 30 2015 as of the november 30 2015 testing date the estimated fair value of the pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 1 percent no additional impairment indicators were noted as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015 there was 311 of goodwill in the pump solutions reporting unit 

given the narrow margin by which the estimated fair value of the pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount we also performed a sensitivity analysis related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate used in the november 30 2015 test specifically we performed the sensitivity analysis by i increasing the discount rate by 50 basis points and ii reducing the longterm growth rate by 25 basis points the pump solutions reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test under the sensitivity test and would have required step two testing to determine potential goodwill impairment 

the november 30 2015 impairment test assumed earnings growth for the pump solutions reporting unit over the next three years should this growth not occur if the reporting unit otherwise fails to meet its current financial plans or if there were changes to any other key assumption used in the test the pump solutions reporting unit could fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in a future period we will continue to monitor the pump solutions reporting unit for impairment 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value we recognized immaterial asset impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  there were no heldforsale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct an impairment review of rental assets as part of this impairment review we estimate the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly review there was no impairment associated with our rental assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for 

 30 

developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements our two reportable segments are i general rentals and ii trench power and pump the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench power and pump segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the pump solutions region which rents pumps primarily used by energy and petrochemical customers the trench power and pump segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our nine  geographic regions—industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic midwest northeast pacific west southcentral south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment we periodically review the size and geographic scope of our regions and have occasionally reorganized the regions to create a more balanced and effective structure in 2015 we reorganized certain of our regions to arrive at the current general rentals region structure historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2015  one  of our general rentals regions had an equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 13  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the rental industry is cyclical and there historically have been regions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions though the specific regions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated we expect margin convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the rental industry which impacts each region differently and our continued focus on fleet sharing we monitor the margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we similarly monitor the margin variances for the regions in the trench power and pump segment the pump solutions region is primarily comprised of locations acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed below as such there isn’t a long history of the pump solutions regions rental margins included in the trench power and pump segment when monitoring for margin convergence we include projected future results we monitor the trench power and pump segment margin variances and confirm the expectation of future convergence on a quarterly basis 

we believe that the regions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics as each region is capital intensive offers similar products to similar customers uses similar methods to distribute its products and is subject to similar competitive risks the aggregation of our regions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance although we believe aggregating these regions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 31 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   



equipment rentals 2015  equipment rentals of  49  billion increased  01 billion  or 27  percent as compared to 2014  as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the equipment rentals increase was primarily due to a 32  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency and a 05  percent rental rate increase partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency rental revenue would have increased 43  percent yearoveryear equipment rentals represented 85  percent of total revenues in 2015  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84  percent and 90  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased slightly yearoveryear primarily reflecting a 23 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent which included the adverse impact of currency partially offset by the adverse impact of inflation related to replacement fleet purchases excluding the adverse impact from currency general rentals rental revenue would have increased 17 percent yearoveryear trench power and pump equipment rentals increased  111  or 186  percent primarily reflecting increased average oec partially offset by decreased time utilization due to the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements the locations acquired in the national pump acquisition experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers trench power and pump average oec for 2015  increased 34  percent including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above as compared to 2014  

2014 equipment rentals of 48 billion increased 06 billion or 148 percent as compared to 2013 as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the equipment rentals increase was primarily due to a 96 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent a 45 percent rental rate increase and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars in 2014 the favorable impact of changes in the mix of equipment rented including the impact of the acquisition of national pump was partially offset by an increase in the 

 32 

proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2014 reflected improvements in our operating environment and the execution of our strategy equipment rentals represented 85 percent of total revenues in 2014 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84 percent and 87 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench power and pump respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 04 billion or 91 percent primarily reflecting a 67 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent increased rental rates and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars in 2014 the favorable impact of changes in the mix of general rentals equipment rented was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts trench power and pump equipment rentals increased 270 or 826 percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates trench power and pump average oec for 2014 increased 75 percent including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above as compared to 2013 capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench power and pump segment was a key component of our strategy in 2014 and 2013 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  sales of rental equipment represented approximately 10  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2015  sales of rental equipment of  538   decreased  slightly from 2014  2014 sales of rental equipment of 544 increased 54 or 110 percent from 2013 primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  sales of new equipment represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2015  sales of new equipment of  157   increased  slightly from 2014  2014 sales of new equipment of 149 increased 45 or 433 percent from 2013 primarily reflecting increased volume including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above improved pricing and changes in mix 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2015  sales of contractor supplies decreased slightly from 2014  and 2014 sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2013 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  service and other revenues represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2015  service and other revenues of  94   increased  slightly from 2014  2014 service and other revenues of 88 increased 10 or 128 percent from 2013 primarily reflecting the impact of the national pump acquisition discussed above 

fourth quarter 2015  items  the fourth quarter of 2015  includes a decrease in stock compensation net of 14  as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014  primarily due to lower than expected revenue and profitability additionally as discussed in note 5  to our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2015  we initiated a restructuring program in response to recent challenges in our operating environment though we expect solid industry growth in 2016 the restructuring program was initiated in an effort to reduce costs in an environment with continuing pressures on volume and pricing we expect to complete the restructuring program in 2016 and recognized 4  of costs for the program in the fourth quarter of 2015  additionally during the fourth quarter of 2015 we reached agreement on a settlement that will provide us with a 5  refund on previously paid property taxes we recognized a reduction of 5  in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation associated with the settlement during the fourth quarter of 2015 additionally our provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015  includes the impact of a 5  increase in valuation allowances resulting from the enactment of connecticut state limitations on net operating loss utilization during the nine months ended september 30 2015 we recognized 57 of excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of cash flows the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements resulted from stockbased compensation windfall deductions in excess of the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes such benefits are recognized as a credit to additional paidin capital and are reported as financing cash flows our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended september 30 2015 included a 57 increase to financing cash flows and a corresponding decrease to operating cash flows associated with the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2015 52  of the previously recognized excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements were reversed due to the impact on taxable income of a bonus tax depreciation bill that passed in the fourth quarter of 2015 the reversal of the previously recognized excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements resulted in a 52  increase to operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 

  fourth quarter 2014  items  the fourth quarter of 2014 includes an increase in bad debt expense of 8 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to improved receivable aging which reduced the expense in the fourth quarter of 2013 additionally the fourth quarter of 2014 includes an increase in stock compensation net of 14 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to improved profitability which resulted in increased performancebased stock compensation

  segment equipment rentals gross profit 

segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  were as follows   



general rentals  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  general rentals accounted for 87  percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2015  increased  29  and equipment rentals gross margin increased 50  basis points primarily reflecting cost improvements partially offset by a 90  basis point decrease in time utilization as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 05  percent delivery costs decreased 32 percent and compensation costs decreased 34 percent time utilization was 686  percent and 695  percent for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively during the year ended december 31 2015  our locations with significant exposure to upstream oil and gas experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers which was a primary driver of the decrease in time utilization general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2014 increased 233 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 220 basis points primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 70 basis point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 91 percent compensation costs increased 50 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and depreciation of rental equipment increased 43 percent time utilization was 695 percent and 688 percent for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

trench power and pump  for the year ended december 31 2015  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  26  and equipment rentals gross margin decreased 430  basis points from 2014  the increase in equipment rentals gross profit primarily reflects increased equipment rentals revenue on a significantly larger fleet at our locations excluding the pump solutions region discussed below at our locations excluding the pump solutions region as compared to 2014  equipment rentals revenue increased approximately 21 percent average oec increased approximately 28 percent and equipment rentals gross profit increased approximately 24 percent the decrease in equipment rentals gross margin primarily reflects decreased margins in the pump solutions region which experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers the aggregate equipment rentals gross margin in the trench power and pump segment excluding the pump solutions region increased by approximately 130 basis points from 2014  for the year ended december 31 2014 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 149 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 380 basis points from 2013 primarily reflecting increased equipment rentals revenue due to an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates and decreased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue trench power and pump average oec for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 75 percent including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above as compared to 2013 as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 826 percent compensation costs increased 574 percent 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   

 34 



2015  gross margin of 426  percent decreased slightly as compared to 2014  equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2014  primarily reflecting a 05  percent rental rate increase and compensation cost improvements offset by a 150  basis point decrease in time utilization time utilization was 673  percent and 688  percent for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively during the year ended december 31 2015  the locations acquired in the national pump acquisition and our other locations with significant exposure to upstream oil and gas experienced volume and pricing pressure associated with upstream oil and gas customers which was a primary driver of the decrease in time utilization as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 27  percent compensation costs were flat with 2014  gross margin from sales of new equipment decreased 290  basis points primarily due to changes in the mix of equipment sold gross margin from service and other revenues decreased 400  basis points primarily due to increased revenue from training activities which generate lower margins than our other service revenues 

2014 gross margin of 428 percent increased 270 basis points as compared to 2013 primarily reflecting increased gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin increased 260 basis points primarily reflecting a 45 percent rental rate increase a 60 basis point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue time utilization was 688 percent and 682 percent for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 148 percent compensation costs increased 87 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and depreciation of rental equipment increased 81 percent gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 620 basis points primarily due to improvements in pricing gross margins from sales of rental equipment may change in future periods if the mix of the channels primarily retail and auction that we use to sell rental equipment changes 

other costsincome 

the table below includes the other costsincome in our consolidated statements of income as well as key associated metrics for the three years in the period ended december 31 2015    



sga expense  primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead the decrease in sga expense for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily reflects decreased incentive compensation costs associated with lower than expected revenue and profitability the impact of increased bad debt expense was largely offset by cost improvements throughout sga bad debt expense increased primarily due to improved receivable aging in 2014  which reduced the expense for year ended december 31 2014  the improvement in sga expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily reflects decreased incentive compensation costs 

 35 

the increase in sga expense for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflects increased compensation costs due to i increased variable compensation costs associated with higher revenues and improved profitability and ii increased headcount the increase in sga as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflects increased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue 

the merger related costs  primarily include financial and legal advisory fees and branding costs associated with the national pump acquisition as well as changes subsequent to the acquisition date to the fair value of the contingent cash consideration we paid associated with the national pump acquisition as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements the income for the year ended december 31 2015  reflects a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the national pump purchase price due to lower than expected financial performance compared to agreed upon financial targets as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

the restructuring charges  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our closed restructuring programs and the restructuring program that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 the branch closure charges primarily reflect continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities the income for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflects buyouts or settlements of real estate leases for less than the recognized reserves we do not expect to incur significant additional charges in connection with the closed restructuring programs and the remaining costs expected to be incurred in connection with the current restructuring program are not currently estimable see note 5  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization  includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2014 increased primarily due to the 2014 acquisition of national pump discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014 includes aggregate losses of 123  and 80  respectively associated with debt redemptions and the amendment of our abl facility excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased primarily due to a lower average cost of debt partially offset by the impact of increased average outstanding debt excluding the impact of the debt redemption losses interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2014 was flat with 2013 

the increase in other income net  for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflects increased gains on sales of nonrental equipment 

a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates  to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements 

balance sheet  accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased by 220  or 383  percent from december 31 2014  to december 31 2015  primarily due to payments made associated with the national pump acquisition discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements and decreased incentive compensation accruals associated with lower than expected revenue and profitability 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate see financial overview above for a summary of the capital structure actions taken in 2015  and 2014  to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 

since 2012 we have repurchased a total of 1450 billion of holdings common stock under three completed share repurchase programs additionally as previously announced in july 2015 our board authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program which commenced in november 2015 we intend to complete the 1 billion program within 18 months of its initiation in november 2015 as of january 25 2016  we have repurchased 166 of holdings common stock under the 1 billion share repurchase program that commenced in november 2015 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of  179  cash equivalents at december 31 2015  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions 

 36 

rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31 2015  



 

 we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service and v share repurchases we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 25 2016  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  100 billion  and  116 billion  in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent  of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility when certain conditions are met cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of 

 37 

the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility as of december 31 2015  specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and as a result this maintenance covenant is inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the abl facility and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2015  we i generated cash from operating activities of  1995  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  555  and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  84  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  1636  ii purchase other companies for  86  iii purchase shares of our common stock for 789  and iv pay  52  of contingent consideration associated with the national pump acquisition as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements during 2015  cash also decreased by 29  due to the effect of foreign exchange rates during 2014 we i generated cash from operating activities of 1801 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 577 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 787 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 1821 ii purchase other companies for 756 and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 613 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow   



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2015  was  919  an increase  of  362  as compared to 557  for the year ended december 31 2014  free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  includes aggregate cash payments of  5  and  17  respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and decreased purchases of rental equipment free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2014 was 557 an increase of 174 as compared to 383 for the year ended december 31 2013 free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 includes aggregate cash payments of 17 and 38 respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental equipment 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2015

holdings receives royalties from urna and its subsidiaries based upon a percent of revenue during the year ended december 31 2015  the royalty percent of revenue the royalty rate increased from two and a half percent to eight percent the increased royalty rate was applied retroactively to january 1 2015 resulting in holdings receiving increased royalties from urna during the year ended december 31 2015  see note 18  to our consolidated financial statements the royalty rate increased as a result of a reassessment of the benefit provided by holdings trademark and its business support to urna and its subsidiaries the increase in the royalty rate will result in increased intercompany receivables for holdings our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of holdings as of december 31 2015  following the retroactive application of the increase in the royalty rate our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments which includes urna’s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of holdings was  499

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of  22 billion  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility see liquidity and capital resources above for the amounts outstanding and the interest rates thereon as of december 31 2015  under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2015  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  13  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

 39 

at december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of  60  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2015  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately five  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11  see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2015  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 8 during the year ended december 31 2015  the average canadian exchange rate deteriorated by approximately 14 percent we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

competition 

the north american equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 12 percent market share based on 2014  equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take 

 6 

advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature and the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 and the resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge a slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our rental equipment is used significantly in private nonresidential construction which is cyclical in nature trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 although in 2014  we saw improvements in the pace of the recovery that began late in the first quarter of 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced while many areas of the global economy are improving a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

  7 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2014  our total indebtedness was 81  billion our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2014  we had 19  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 23  percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

  8 

even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda as such ratios are described in the agreement governing our abl facility as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and 150 million since the october 2011 amendment of the abl facility and through december 31 2014  availability under the abl facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding as such ratios and tests are described in the agreement governing our accounts receivable securitization facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on 1 liens 2 saleleaseback transactions 3 indebtedness 4 mergers consolidations and acquisitions 5 sales transfers and other dispositions of assets 6 loans and other investments 7 dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments 8 dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries 9 transactions with affiliates and 10 issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries  future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to 

 9 

reduce expenditures we cannot guarantee that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agents in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis including potential growth opportunities for our trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions specialty business from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future with respect to our specialty business or otherwise or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

  10 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

  11 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our recently announced share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in december 2014 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 750 million excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses currently we intend to complete the share repurchase program within 18 months from the date of such authorization 

although the board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

 12 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2014  we had 33  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results 

we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected for instance during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 million related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflected adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as workers compensation claims it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

 13 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2015  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

 14 

disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems denialofservice attacks viruses malicious software phishing attacks security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites networks and systems that we otherwise maintain we may not anticipate or combat all types of attacks until after they have already been launched if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could violate applicable privacy data security and other laws and give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity harm our reputation lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 760  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 800  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 11700  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing 

 15 

employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly our business could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products 

demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies including national oil companies regional exploration and production providers and related service providers the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration development and production activity which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even the perception of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include 

 our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain 

 16 

or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 881  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  84  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3300  classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2014  equipment rental revenues represented 85  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and operational efficiency 

in 2015  we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2015  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to recover and drive demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect that north american industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 8  percent 

on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of rsc holdings inc rsc the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date rsc which had total revenue of 15 billion for 2011 was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america and as of december 31 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 us states and three canadian provinces 

in april 2014 we acquired certain assets of the following four entities national pump  compressor ltd canadian pump and compressor ltd gulfco industrial equipment lp and ld services llc collectively “national pump” the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date national pump was the second largest specialty pump rental company in north america national pump was a leading supplier of pumps for energy and petrochemical customers with upstream oil and gas customers representing about half of its revenue national pump had a total of 35  branches including four  branches in western canada and had annual revenues of approximately  210  for additional information concerning the national pump acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec for the full year 2014  we achieved 

 financial overview 

over the last several years we took a number of positive actions related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery as of december 31 2014  we had available liquidity of  111 billion  including cash of  158  

net income  net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  were as follows 

  



net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  include the impacts of the following special items amounts presented on an aftertax basis 

  



  

 in addition to the matters discussed above our 2014  performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment as discussed below see “results of operations income taxes” our results for 2012 reflect a tax provision of 13 which equates to an effective tax rate of 148 percent 

ebitda gaap reconciliations   ebitda represents the sum of net income provision for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the merger related costs restructuring charge stock compensation expense net the impact of the fair value markup of the acquired rsc fleet and the gain on sale of software subsidiary these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliations provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

 for the year ended december 31 2014  ebitda increased  418  or 192  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  425  or 185  percent the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases include the impact of the national pump acquisition discussed above the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases primarily reflect increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2014  ebitda margin increased 17  percentage points to 457  percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 15  percentage points to 478  percent the increases in the ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins primarily reflect increased margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment 

for the year ended december 31 2013 ebitda increased 680 or 453 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 521 or 294 percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and reduced merger related costs and restructuring charges partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expense and the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expense the ebitda and adjusted ebitda increases include the impact of the rsc acquisition for the year ended december 31 2013 ebitda margin increased 75 percentage points to 440 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 33 percentage points to 463 percent the increase in ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals improved selling general and administrative leverage and reduced merger related costs and restructuring charges the increase in adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and improved selling general and administrative leverage ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2013 and 2012 also include the impact of 236 and 104 respectively of cost savings from operating efficiencies and synergies achieved subsequent to the rsc acquisition 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  were as follows 

  



equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel collectively these ancillary fees represented about 11  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2014  delivery and pickup revenue which represented about seven  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2014  is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or rpp revenue rpp revenue which represented about two  percent of equipment rental revenue in 2014  is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer and consumption if any can be measured sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet including parts sales 

2014  total revenues of  57  billion increased 147  percent compared with total revenues of  50  billion in 2013  as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the revenue increase reflects a 148  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 96  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent a 45  percent rental rate increase and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2014  the favorable impact of changes in the mix of equipment rented including the impact of the acquisition of national pump was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2014  reflect improvements in our operating environment and the execution of our strategy rental rate changes are calculated based on the yearoveryear variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix additionally sales of rental equipment increased 110  percent primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing 

2013 total revenues of 50 billion increased 204 percent compared with total revenues of 41 billion in 2012 the increase reflects a 214 percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 221 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 42 percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis that is assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for full year 2012 partially offset by changes in rental mix there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2013 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2013 reflected in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition the 221 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects increased capital expenditures on rental fleet and improved asset productivity additionally sales of rental equipment increased 228 percent primarily reflecting increased volume including the impact of the rsc acquisition improved pricing and changes in mix 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  36  and 30 as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers for equipment delivery and pickup to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent and for fuel delivery and pickup revenue is recognized when the service is performed customers have the option of purchasing a damage waiver when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage we refer to the fee we charge for the waiver as rental protection plan or rpp revenue rpp revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term fees related to the consumption of fuel by our customers are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer and consumption if any can be measured 

revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  39  44 and 24 for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  97  or  124  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  10  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  16  or  24  respectively 

purchase price allocation  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past including the rsc and national pump acquisitions discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition longlived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions within our industry including our own acquisitions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies within our industry including our own acquisitions 

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2013 we performed the following procedures 

qualitative assessment  for 10 of our reporting units which had combined goodwill of 23 billion as of october 1 2013 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts after reaching this conclusion no further testing was performed the qualitative factors we considered included but were not limited to general economic conditions our outlook for construction activity our recent and forecasted financial performance and the price of the companys common stock 

impairment test  in 2013 there was a change in our internal reporting structure that impacted four of our regions trench safety power and hvac pacific west and western canada as a result of this realignment for these four regions which had combined goodwill of 626 as of october 1 2013 we bypassed the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that each of these reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 44 percent in connection with this impairment testing we utilized a discount rate of between 95 percent and 130 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period we also performed sensitivity analyses related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate specifically we stress tested our results under the following three scenarios i increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points ii reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent and iii increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points and reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent in each of these three scenarios the fair values still exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2014 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units excluding our pump solutions reporting unit had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 63  percent all of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were acquired in the april 2014 national pump acquisition discussed above the estimated fair value of our pump solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 13  percent as all of the assets in the pump solutions reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the april 2014 acquisition date we expected the percentage by which the pump solutions reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized a discount rate of 90 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we recognized asset impairment charges of  1  4 and 15 respectively in our general rentals segment the impairment charges primarily represent writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the restructuring activity discussed below and are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as of december 31 2014  and 2013  there were no heldforsale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct an impairment review of rental assets as part of this impairment review we estimate the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed quarterly review there was no impairment associated with our rental assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels as discussed below during the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 we recognized benefits of 3 and 6 respectively related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements our two reportable segments are i general rentals and ii trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions segment is comprised of i the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work ii the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment and iii the pump solutions region which rents pumps primarily used by energy and petrochemical customers the trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our 12 geographic regions—eastern canada gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic midcentral midwest mountain west northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2014  certain of our regions had equipment rentals gross margins that varied by between 10 percent and 14  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period for the year ended december 31 2014  the aggregate general rentals equipment rentals gross margin increased 22  percentage points to 424  percent primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 07  percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 91  percent compensation costs increased 50 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and depreciation of rental equipment increased 43 percent our equipment rental revenue increased more than our costs because rates—which were a significant driver of the yearoveryear revenue improvement—result in fewer variable costs compared to utilization 

for the five year period ended december 31 2014  the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was the pacific west  the pacific west  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 352  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2014  was 12  percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the pacific west  regions equipment rentals gross margin was less than the other general rentals regions during this period due to weaker end markets for the year ended december 31 2014  the pacific west  regions equipment rentals gross margin increased 39  percentage points to 413  percent primarily reflecting a 48  percent rental rate increase and a 11  percentage point increase in time utilization and cost improvements as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 55  percent compensation costs depreciation and aggregate repair and maintenance and delivery costs were flat rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix 

for the five year period ended december 31 2014  the general rentals region with the highest equipment rentals gross margin was the south  the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 445  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2014  was 14  percent more than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin was more than the other general rentals regions during this period due to strong end markets that have recovered faster than other parts of the country for the year ended december 31 2014  the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin increased 30  percentage points to 480  percent primarily reflecting a 51  percent rental rate increase due to strong end markets 

although the margins for certain of our general rentals regions exceeded a 10 percent variance level for the five year period ended december 31 2014  we expect convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the construction industry which impacts each region differently and our continued focus on fleet sharing additionally the margins for the five year period ended december 31 2014  include the significant impact of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 we began to see recovery late in the first quarter of 2010 but the economic impact of the downturn and the pace of recovery impacted all of our regions differently although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows

equipment rentals 2014  equipment rentals of  48  billion increased  06 billion  or 148  percent as compared to 2013  as discussed above in april 2014 we acquired national pump and the results of national pumps operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date the equipment rentals increase was primarily due to a 96  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent a 45  percent rental rate increase and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2014  the favorable impact of changes in the mix of equipment rented including the impact of the acquisition of national pump was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2014  reflect improvements in our operating environment and the execution of our strategy equipment rentals represented 85  percent of total revenues in 2014  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84  percent and 87  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  04 billion  or 91  percent primarily reflecting a 67 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent increased rental rates and changes in rental mix partially offset by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars in 2014  the favorable impact of changes in the mix of general rentals equipment rented was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions equipment rentals increased  270  or 826  percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions average oec for 2014  increased 75  percent including the impact of the acquisition of national pump discussed above as compared to 2013  capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions segment was a key component of our strategy in 2014 and 2013 

2013 equipment rentals of 42 billion increased 07 billion or 214 percent as compared to 2012 primarily reflecting a 221 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 42 percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis that is assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for full year 2012 partially offset by changes in rental mix in 2013 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2013 reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our 

 23 

operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition the 221 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects increased capital expenditures on rental fleet and improved asset productivity equipment rentals represented 85 percent of total revenues in 2013 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 07 billion or 214 percent primarily reflecting a 222 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions equipment rentals increased 60 or 225 percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions average oec for 2013 increased 19 percent as compared to 2012 capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench safety power and hvac and pump solutions segment was a key component of our strategy in 2013 and 2012

merger related costs for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  were as follows   



as discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements in april 2012 we completed the acquisition of rsc and in april 2014 we completed the acquisition of national pump the merger related costs primarily relate to financial and legal advisory fees and branding costs associated with the rsc and national pump acquisitions the 2014 costs also include changes subsequent to the acquisition date to the fair value of the contingent cash consideration we expect to pay associated with the national pump acquisition as discussed in note 11  to our consolidated financial statements 

restructuring charges for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  were as follows   



the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with the rsc merger related restructuring program and our closed restructuring program the 

 26 

branch closure charges primarily reflect continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities the income for the year ended december 31 2014  primarily reflects buyouts or settlements of real estate leases for less than the recognized reserves we do not expect to incur significant additional charges in connection with these restructuring programs both of which were complete as of december 31 2014  see note 5  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

 27 

other income net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  was as follows   



the increase in other income net for the year ended december 31 2014  primarily reflects increased gains on sales of nonrental equipment the decrease in other income net for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily reflects an 8 gain recognized in 2012 upon the sale of a former subsidiary that developed and marketed software 

income taxes  the following table summarizes our provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rates for each respective period 



  

 

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 365  percent 360  percent and 148  percent for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent relate primarily to the geographical mix of income between us and foreign and state operations and state taxes and certain nondeductible charges the 2012 provision reflects a writeoff of certain state deferred tax assets as a result of the rsc acquisition a canadian tax benefit due to settlements with the canadian revenue authority and a us tax transfer pricing benefit 

balance sheet  the asset increases from december 31 2013  to december 31 2014  reflect the significant impact of the national pump acquisition discussed in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements accounts receivable net increased by 136  or 169  percent from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014  primarily due to increased 2014  revenue accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 185  or 474  percent from december 31 2012 to december 31 2014  primarily due to consideration we expect to pay associated with the national pump acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

during the last several years we took a number of actions related to our capital structure to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

  28 

 as previously announced in connection with the rsc acquisition our board authorized a stock buyback of up to 200 of holdings common stock which we intended to complete within 18 months after the april 30 2012 closing of the rsc acquisition and completed as of december 31 2013 additionally in 2013 our board authorized a 500 share repurchase program our intention was to complete such program within 18 months after the october 2013 announcement we accelerated the program which was complete as of december 31 2014  in 2014 our board authorized a new 750 share repurchase program which we intend to complete within 18 months after the december 2014 announcement during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  in the aggregate we repurchased 593 and 94 respectively of holdings common stock under these programs as of january 19 2015 we have repurchased 225 of holdings common stock under the 750 share repurchase program announced in december 2014 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2014  we had i  946  of borrowing capacity net of  50  of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii  2  of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of  158  cash equivalents at december 31 2014  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2014   13 billion  and  548  were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility respectively the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2014  were 22  percent and 08  percent respectively during the year ended december 31 2014  the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both prior to and after amendment and renewal of the accounts receivable securitization facility were  11 billion  and  473  respectively and the weightedaverage interest rates thereon were 23  percent and 08  percent respectively the maximum monthend amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both prior to and after amendment and renewal of the accounts receivable securitization facility during the year ended december 31 2014  were  13 billion  and  550  respectively 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v acquisitions and vi share repurchases we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 19 2015  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in 2014  relative to 2013  net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  116 

 29 

billion  and  109 billion  in 2014  and 2013  respectively we expect net rental capital expenditures of approximately 12  billion and gross rental purchases of approximately 17  billion in 2015  

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

as discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and 150 since the october 2011 amendment of the abl facility and through december 31 2014  availability under the abl facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2014  we i generated cash from operating activities of  1801  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  577  and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  787  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  1821  ii purchase other companies for  756  and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 613  during 2013 we i generated cash from operating activities of 1551 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 516 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 1684 ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of 160 and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 115 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow usage” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements net management believes that free cash flow usage provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow usage is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow usage should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow usage 

  



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2014  was  557  an increase  of  174  as compared to 383  for the year ended december 31 2013  free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  includes aggregate cash payments of  17  and  38  respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental equipment free cash usage for the year ended december 31 2013 was 383 an increase of 606 as compared to free cash usage of 223 for the year ended december 31 2012 free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 includes aggregate cash payments of 38 and 150 respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales 

 30 

of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental equipment we expect free cash flow in the range of 725  to 775  in 2015  and intend to use this to reduce our leverage and to fund our share repurchase program discussed above 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2014

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of  19 billion  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of  13 billion  of borrowings under the abl facility and  548  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2014  were i 22  percent for the abl facility and ii 08  percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2014  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  11  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of  62  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2014  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate 

 31 

indebtedness by approximately six  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see note 11  see “fair value of financial instruments” and note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2014  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 12 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk   in connection with the november 2009 4 percent convertible notes offering holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cost 26 and decreased additional paidin capital by 17 net of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity deficit the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 07  million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock at issuance the effective conversion price is subject to change in certain circumstances such as if the 4 percent convertible notes are converted prior to may 15 2015 in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds the effective conversion price per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was  8000  or  10000  per share assuming an effective conversion price of 1556 per share on a net basis we would issue 26 million  or 27 million  shares respectively based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2014  holders of the 4 percent convertible notes have the right to redeem the notes during the first quarter of 2015  at a conversion price of 1111 per share of common stock since january 1 2015  the beginning of the first quarter none of the 4 percent convertible senior notes were redeemed however we have received redemption notices for  26  of the 4 percent convertible senior notes which we expect to be redeemed in the first quarter of 2015 

if the total 34  outstanding principal amount of the 4 percent convertible notes was converted the total cost to settle the notes would be  310  assuming a conversion price of 10201  the closing price of our common stock on december 31 2014  per share of common stock the 34  principal amount would be settled in cash and the remaining  276  could be settled in cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our discretion based on the december 31 2014  closing stock price approximately 3  million shares of stock excluding any stock we would receive from the option counterparties as discussed below would be issued if we settled the entire  276  of conversion value in excess of the principal amount in stock the total cost to settle would change approximately 3  for each  1  actual dollars change in our stock price if the full principal amount was converted at our december 31 2014  closing stock price we estimate that we would receive approximately  3  in either cash or stock from the option counterparties after which the effective conversion price would be approximately 1210

as of december 31 2013  our fleet of rental equipment included approximately 410000  units the total original equipment cost of our fleet “oec” based on the initial consideration paid was 77  billion at december 31 2013  compared with 72 billion at december 31 2012  the fleet includes 

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used equipment as well as related parts and service and contractor supplies 

acquisition of rsc 

on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of rsc holdings inc rsc the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date rsc which had total revenue of 15 billion for 2011 was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america and as of december 31 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 us states and three canadian provinces for additional information concerning the rsc acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

strategy 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and cost control 

our strategy calls for 

  1 

 in 2012 we adopted the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec 2013 and 2012 operating metrics have been presented on this same basis 

for the full year 2013  compared with 2012  we achieved 

 in 2014  we will intensify our disciplined focus on profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 industry overview and economic outlook 

united rentals serves three principal end markets for equipment rental in north america industrial and other nonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential construction which includes remodeling in 2013  based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

  2 

 we estimate that overall north american construction activity including industrial and other nonconstruction commercial and residential grew approximately 5  percent in 2013  yearoveryear and that north american equipment rental revenue grew approximately 7  percent yearoveryear we believe the growth in rental revenue exceeded underlying construction activity in part because of a continuing shift from the owning of equipment to renting “secular penetration” 

in this environment we increased our full year rental revenue by 70  percent yearoveryear on a pro forma basis outpacing the recovery in the overall construction market we believe the revenue increase reflects a combination of positive factors the improvement in our operating environment further secular penetration and the benefit of our strategy particularly our increased focus on key customers 

in 2014  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to recover and drive demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect overall north american construction activity and equipment rental revenue to increase approximately 8  percent 

competitive advantages

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  61  percent and 60 percent respectively of our equipment rental revenues on a pro forma basis assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for full year 2012 were derived from accounts including national accounts and other key accounts that are managed by a single point of contact

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 32 percent of our 2013  purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 71 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 12 percent market share based on 2013  equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association “ara” our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this 

 6 

environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

we have approximately 11850  employees of these approximately 3650  are salaried personnel and approximately 8200  are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 77  separate locations cover approximately 850  of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

our business is cyclical in nature and the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 and the resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge a slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our rental equipment is used significantly in private nonresidential construction which is cyclical in nature trench safety power and hvac equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities our industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010 although in 2013  we saw modest improvements in the pace of the recovery that began late in the first quarter of 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced while many areas of the global economy are improving a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

  7 

 our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2013  our total indebtedness was 72  billion our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by among other things 

 a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2013  we had 15  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 21  percent of our total indebtedness see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments to a significant extent our ability to do so is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

  8 

even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms if at all our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operation 

our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control in addition prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations financial condition cash flows and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda as such ratios are described in the agreement governing our abl facility as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and 150 million since the october 2011 amendment of the abl facility and through december 31 2013  availability under the abl facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding as such ratios and tests are described in the agreement governing our accounts receivable securitization facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on 1 liens 2 saleleaseback transactions 3 indebtedness 4 mergers consolidations and acquisitions 5 sales transfers and other dispositions of assets 6 loans and other investments 7 dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments 8 dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries 9 transactions with affiliates and 10 issuances of disqualified capital stock future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to

reduce expenditures we cannot assure you that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agents in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets 

we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions most recently with our acquisition of rsc in 2012 we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis including potential growth opportunities for our trench safety power and hvac specialty business from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future with respect to our specialty business or otherwise or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 

in addition it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisitions including the rsc acquisition or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

  10 

 our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with the rsc acquisition and other past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally in addition if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create which may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities or the risks associated with debt incurrence 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

  11 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in certain cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our recently announced share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

on october 15 2013 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 500 million excluding fees commissions and other ancillary expenses currently we intend to complete the share repurchase program within 18 months from the date of such authorization 

although the board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the timing and amount of repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market business conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock further our share repurchase program may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

 12 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2013  we had 30  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results 

we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and semiannually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected for instance during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 million related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflected adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as workers compensation claims it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and 

 13 

generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2014  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive 

 14 

pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 718  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 850  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 11000  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

 15 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 832  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  77  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3100  classes of equipment for rent to construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and other customers our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2013  equipment rental revenues represented 85  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth margin expansion and operational efficiencies in particular we have focused on customer segmentation customer service differentiation rate management fleet management and cost control 

our strategy calls for 

 on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of rsc holdings inc “rsc” the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date rsc which had total revenue of 15 billion for 2011 was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america and as of december 31 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 us states and three canadian provinces since the acquisition date significant amounts of fleet have been moved between legacy united rentals locations and the acquired rsc locations and it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amounts of revenue and earnings of rsc since the acquisition date the impact of the rsc acquisition on our equipment rentals revenue is primarily reflected in the 221  percent increase in 2013 in the volume of oec on rent for additional information concerning the rsc acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2012 we adopted the american rental association criteria for reporting rental rates time utilization and oec 2013 and 2012 operating metrics have been presented on this same basis 

for the full year 2013  compared with 2012  we achieved 

  21 

 in 2014  we will intensify our disciplined focus on profitability and return on invested capital in particular our strategy calls for 

 in 2014  based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to recover and drive demand for equipment rental services specifically we expect overall north american construction activity and equipment rental revenue to increase approximately 8  pe rcent 

financial overview 

despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions and as discussed elsewhere in this report we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in 2013  and 2012  related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery as of december 31 2013  we had available liquidity of  137 billion  including cash of  175

in addition to the matters discussed above our 2013  performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment as discussed below see “results of operations income taxes” our results for 2012 reflect a tax provision of 13 which equates to an effective tax rate of 148 percent 

ebitda gaap reconciliations   ebitda represents the sum of net income provision for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the rsc merger related costs restructuring charge stock compensation expense net the impact of the fair value markup of the acquired rsc fleet and inventory and the gain on sale of software subsidiary these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliations provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  were as follows 

  



equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services including parts sales 

2013  total revenues of  50  billion increased 204  percent compared with total revenues of  41  billion in 2012  the increase reflects a 214  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 221  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 42  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2013  we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2013  reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition the 221  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects increased capital expenditures on rental fleet and improved asset productivity rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix additionally sales of rental equipment increased 228  percent primarily reflecting increased volume including the impact of the rsc acquisition improved pricing and changes in mix 

2012 total revenues of 41 billion increased 577 percent compared with total revenues of 26 billion in 2011 the increase reflects a 606 percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 632 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 69 percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix in 2012 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2012 reflected in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected 

 26 

in the increase in the volume of oec on rent additionally sales of rental equipment increased 918 percent primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing in a stronger retail market and the impact of the rsc acquisition 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  30  and 26 as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  44  24 and 10 for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  96  or  124  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  10  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  16  or  23  respectively

purchase price allocation  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past including the acquisition of rsc in 2012 and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition long lived assets principally rental equipment goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions within our industry including our own acquisitions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections  we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates  beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units cash flow stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates  each reporting units estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units business enterprise this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies within our industry including our own acquisitions

financial accounting standards board fasb guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2012 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 15 percent in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized a discount rate of 90 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period we also performed sensitivity analyses related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate specifically we stress tested our results under the following three scenarios i increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points ii reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent and iii increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points and reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent in each of these three scenarios the fair values still exceeded the carrying values for each reporting unit 

in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2013 we performed the following procedures 

qualitative assessment  for 10  of our reporting units which had combined goodwill of  23 billion  as of october 1 2013 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts after reaching this conclusion no further testing was performed the qualitative factors we considered included but were not limited to general economic conditions our outlook for construction activity our recent and forecasted financial performance and the price of the companys common stock 

impairment test  in 2013  there was a change in our internal reporting structure that impacted four of our regions trench safety power and hvac pacific west and western canada as a result of this realignment for these four regions which had combined goodwill of  626  as of october 1 2013 we bypassed the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that each of these reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 44  percent in connection with this impairment testing we utilized a discount rate of between 95 percent and 130 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period we also performed sensitivity analyses related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate specifically we stress tested our results under the following three scenarios i increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points ii reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent and iii increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points and reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent in each of these three scenarios the fair values still exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we recognized asset impairment charges of  4  15 and 4 respectively in our general rentals segment the impairment charges primarily represent writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the restructuring activity discussed below and are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as of december 31 2013  and 2012  there were no heldforsale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold we select these assets which represented approximately four percent of our total rental assets at december 31 2013  as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment as part of this impairment review we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed december 31 2013  quarterly review there was no impairment associated with these assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize 

 29 

deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels as discussed below during the fourth quarters of 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized benefits of 3  6 and 8 respectively related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 14  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety power and hvac the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench safety power and hvac segment is comprised of the trench safety region which rents trench safety equipment such as trench shields aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work and the power and hvac region which rents power and hvac equipment such as portable diesel generators electrical distribution equipment and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment the trench safety power and hvac segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies the trench safety power and hvac segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our 12 geographic regions—eastern canada gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic midcentral midwest mountain west northeast pacific west south southeast and western canada—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2013  certain of our regions had equipment rentals 

 30 

gross margins that varied by between 10 percent and 22  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period for the year ended december 31 2013  the aggregate general rentals equipment rentals gross margin increased 13  percentage points to 402  percent primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 07  percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 214  percent compensation costs increased 150 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition our equipment rental revenue increased more than our costs because rates—which were a significant driver of the yearoveryear revenue improvement—result in fewer variable costs compared to utilization 

for the five year period ended december 31 2013  the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was the southeast  the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 303  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2013  was 17  percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin was less than the other general rentals regions during this period as it experienced more significant declines in its end markets than the other regions which led to more competitive pricing pressure and lower fleet investment for the year ended december 31 2013  the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin increased 50  percentage points to 394  percent primarily reflecting a 69  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis and a 42  percentage point increase in time utilization and equipment rentals revenue increased 291  percent including the impact of the rsc acquisition 

for the five year period ended december 31 2013  the general rentals region with the highest equipment rentals gross margin was western canada  the western canada  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 435  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2013  was 22  percent more than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the western canada  regions equipment rentals gross margin was more than the other general rentals regions during this period as the region benefited from strong demand for natural resources which have been more resistant to the economic pressures experienced in other regions for the year ended december 31 2013  the western canada  regions equipment rentals gross margin decreased 24  percentage points to 458  percent primarily due to increased compensation costs and an increase in aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 256  percent which includes the impact of the rsc acquisition i compensation costs increased 330 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition and ii aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 400 percent 

although the margins for certain of our general rentals regions exceeded a 10 percent variance level for the five year period ended december 31 2013  we expect convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the construction industry which impacts each region differently and our continued focus on cost cutting improved processes and fleet sharing additionally the margins for the five year period ended december 31 2013  include the significant impact of the economic downturn in 2009 that impacted all our regions for the year ended december 31 2013  the largest variance from the aggregated general rentals regions margin was 14 percent as compared to 22  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2013  although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   

 31 



equipment rentals 2013  equipment rentals of  42  billion increased  07 billion  or 214  percent as compared to 2012  primarily reflecting a 221  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 42  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix in 2013  we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2013  reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition the 221  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent reflects increased capital expenditures on rental fleet and improved asset productivity equipment rentals represented 85  percent of total revenues in 2013  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 84  percent and 90  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  07 billion  or 214  percent primarily reflecting a 222 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals increased  60  or 225  percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates trench safety power and hvac average oec for 2013  increased 19  percent as compared to 2012  capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin equipment rented by our trench safety power and hvac segment has been a key component of our strategy in 2013 and 2012 

2012 equipment rentals of 35 billion increased 13 billion or 606 percent as compared to 2011 primarily reflecting a 632 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 69 percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix in 2012 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2012 reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent equipment rentals represented 84 percent of total revenues in 2012 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 83 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and 

 32 

trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 12 billion or 632 percent primarily reflecting a 636 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals increased 69 or 348 percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent trench safety power and hvac average oec for 2012 increased 47 percent as compared to 2011 the trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals growth was less than the increase in average oec primarily due to oec mix as a significant portion of the oec growth was in product lines that generate less revenue per oec dollar such as power and hvac equipment 

sales of rental equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  sales of rental equipment represented approximately 9  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2013  sales of rental equipment of  490   increased   91  or 228  percent from 2012  primarily reflecting increased volume including the impact of the rsc acquisition improved pricing and changes in mix 2012 sales of rental equipment of 399 increased 191 or 918 percent from 2011 primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing in a stronger retail market and the impact of the rsc acquisition 

sales of new equipment  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  sales of new equipment represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2013  sales of new equipment of  104   increased   11  or 118  percent from 2012  primarily reflecting increased volume including the impact of the rsc acquisition and improved pricing in a stronger retail market 2012 sales of new equipment of 93 increased 9 or 107 percent from 2011 primarily reflecting changes in the mix of equipment sold and improved pricing 

sales of contractor supplies  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2013  sales of contractor supplies were flat with 2012  2012 sales of contractor supplies of 87 increased 2 or 24 percent from 2011 

service and other revenues  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  service and other revenues represented approximately 2  percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for substantially all of these sales 2013  service and other revenues of  78   decreased   5  or 60 percent  from 2012  primarily due to the sale in 2012 of a subsidiary that developed and marketed software 2012 service and other revenues of 83 were flat with 2011 

fourth quarter 2013  items  the fourth quarter of 2013  includes a reduction in bad debt expe nse of 17  as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily due to improved receivable aging in the fourth quarter of 2013  we recognized a benefit of 3  in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation related to our provision for selfinsurance r eserves 

  fourth quarter 2012  items  in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized 13 of charges related to the rsc acquisition additionally during the quarter we recognized restructuring charges of 6 primarily reflecting branch closure charges associated with the rsc acquisition during the quarter we also recognized asset impairment charges of 2 which are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization and principally relate to writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets   during the fourth quarter of 2012 we redeemed our 10 7  8  percent senior notes and all of our outstanding 1 7  8 percent convertible senior subordinated notes were converted upon redemptionconversion we recognized a loss of 72 in interest expense net the loss represents the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchaseconversion price of these securities during the quarter we also recognized a benefit of 6 in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves 

fourth quarter 2011  items  in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recognized 19 of acquisitionrelated costs associated with the rsc acquisition additionally during the quarter we closed 18 branches and recognized restructuring charges of 14 during the quarter we also recognized a benefit of 8 in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves during the quarter we also recognized asset impairment charges of 3 which are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization and principally relate to writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in connection with our closed restructuring program in the quarter we also purchased an aggregate of 32 of quarterly income preferred securities “quips” for 32 in connection with this transaction we retired 32 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures and recognized a loss of 1 in interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures reflecting the writeoff of capitalized debt issuance costs interest expense net for the fourth quarter of 2011 also includes a loss of 3 reflecting writeoffs of debt issuance costs associated with the amendment of our abl facility discussed below

general rentals  for the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  general rentals accounted for 90  percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2013  increased  318  and equipment rentals gross margin increased 13  percentage points primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 07  percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 214  percent compensation costs increased 150 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition time utilization was 688  percent and 681  percent for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit in 2012 increased 596 and equipment rentals gross margin increased 60 percentage points primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 03 percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and cost improvements as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 632 percent i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 454 percent due primarily to higher rental volume ii compensation costs increased 441 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition and iii building and property costs increased 323 percent due primarily to the impact of the rsc acquisition time utilization was 681 percent and 678 percent for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

trench safety power and hvac  for the year ended december 31 2013  equipment rentals gross profit increased by  28  and equipment rentals gross margin was flat with 2012  the increase in gross profit primarily reflects increased average oec which contributed to higher revenue trench safety power and hvac average oec for the year ended december 31 2013  increased 19  percent as compared to 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012 equipment rentals gross profit increased by 32 and equipment rentals gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points from 2011 the increase in gross profit primarily reflects increased average oec which contributed to higher revenue trench safety power and hvac average oec for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 47 percent as compared to 2011 the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects increased depreciation due to increased oec partially offset by a reduction in lower margin rerent revenue equipment we rent from other companies and then rent to customers which yields lower margins as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 348 percent depreciation increased 500 percent 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows   



2013  gross margin of 401  percent increased 16  percentage points as compared to 2012  primarily reflecting increased gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin increased 13  percentage points including the benefit of cost synergies realized from the merger with rsc primarily reflecting a 42  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis a 07  percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and decreased compensation costs as a percentage of revenue as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 214  percent 

 34 

compensation costs increased 154 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition time utilization was 682  percent and 675  percent for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 46  percentage points primarily due to improvements in pricing and channel mix gross margins from sales of rental equipment may change in future periods if the mix of the channels primarily retail and auction that we use to sell rental equipment changes 

2012 gross margin of 385 percent increased 41 percentage points as compared to 2011 primarily reflecting increased gross margins from equipment rentals equipment rentals gross margin increased 53 percentage points primarily reflecting a 69 percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis a 03 percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and cost improvements as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 606 percent i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 448 percent due primarily to higher rental volume ii compensation costs increased 432 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition and iii building and property costs increased 327 percent due primarily to the impact of the rsc acquisition time utilization was 675 percent and 672 percent for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses  sga expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  was as follows   



sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees advertising and marketing expenses management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 

2013  sga expense of  642  increased  54  as compared to 2012  the increase in sga primarily reflects increased compensation costs associated with higher revenues improved profitability and increased headcount following the rsc acquisition and increased travel and entertainment and office expenses following the rsc acquisition partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense primarily due to improved receivable aging 2013  bad debt expense decreased 33 as compared to 2012  as a percentage of revenue sga expense improved by 13  percentage points year over year including the benefit of cost synergies realized from the merger with rsc the improvement in sga as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the reduction in bad debt expense and a decrease in compensation costs as a percentage of revenue 

2012 sga expense of 588 increased 181 as compared to 2011 the increase in sga primarily reflects increased compensation costs associated with higher revenues improved profitability and increased headcount following the rsc acquisition additionally our bad debt expense was higher due to a 709 percent increase in accounts receivable including the acquired rsc accounts receivable since december 31 2011 and a deterioration in our accounts receivable aging additionally travel and entertainment and office expenses have increased following the rsc acquisition as a percentage of revenue sga expense improved by 13 percentage points year over year 

rsc merger related costs for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  were as follows   



as discussed above in the second quarter of 2012 we completed the rsc acquisition the acquisitionrelated costs primarily relate to financial and legal advisory fees and branding costs the fees for the year ended december 31 2012 include 31 of interim bridge financing costs 

restructuring charges for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  were as follows   



the restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with the rsc merger related restructuring program and our closed restructuring program the 

 35 

branch closure charges primarily reflect continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities we do not expect to incur significant additional charges in connection with the restructuring programs both of which were complete as of december 31 2013  see note 5  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonrental depreciation and amortization  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  was as follows   



nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2013  increased primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of rsc discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2012 increased primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of rsc 

interest expense net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  was as follows   



as discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements in march 2012  we issued 2825  of debt the merger financing notes in connection with the rsc acquisition upon completion of the rsc acquisition we also assumed rscs debt that remained after repayment of certain of rscs debt interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2013   decreased  by  37  or 7  percent interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 includes 29 of interest recorded on the merger financing notes prior to the closing of the merger additionally during 2012 we redeemed our 10 7  8  percent senior notes and all of our outstanding 1 7  8 percent convertible senior subordinated notes were converted upon redemptionconversion we recognized a loss of 72 in interest expense net the loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchaseconversion price of these securities excluding the impact of these matters interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2013  increased primarily due to increased average outstanding debt including the debt issued and assumed in connection with the rsc acquisition as compared to 2012 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 increased by 284 or 125 percent interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 includes 29 of interest recorded on the merger financing notes prior to the closing of the merger and the loss of 72 recognized upon redemptionconversion of our 10 7  8  percent senior notes and 1 7  8 percent convertible senior subordinated notes in addition to these matters interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 increased primarily due to increased average outstanding debt including the debt issued and assumed in connection with the rsc acquisition as compared to 2011 

interest expense—subordinated convertible debentures  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  was as follows   



as discussed further in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflected the obligation to our subsidiary trust that had issued quips this subsidiary was not consolidated in our financial statements because we were not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2013  the trust was liquidated during the year ended december 31 2013  an aggregate of 55 of quips was redeemed as of december 31 2013  there were no quips or subordinated convertible debentures outstanding as of december 31 2012 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was 55 interest expense subordinated convertible debentures for 2013 and 2011 includes losses of 2 recognized in connection with the simultaneous purchase of quips and retirement of the subordinated convertible debentures 

other income net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  was as follows   

 36 



the decrease in other income net for the year ended december 31 2013  and increase in other income net for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily reflect an 8 gain recognized in 2012 upon the sale of a former subsidiary that developed and marketed software 

income taxes  the following table summarizes our provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rates for each respective period 



  

 

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 360  percent 148  percent and 384  percent for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent relate primarily to the geographical mix of income between us and foreign and state operations and state taxes and certain nondeductible charges the 2012 provision reflects a writeoff of certain state deferred tax assets as a result of the rsc acquisition a canadian tax benefit due to settlements with the canadian revenue authority and a us tax transfer pricing benefit the 2011 provision reflects the nondeductibility of certain costs associated with the proposed rsc acquisition 

balance sheet  prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by 58  or 523  percent from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013  primarily due to the timing of receipts associated with vendor incentives and the timing of property lease payments other intangibles net decreased by  182  or 152  percent from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013  primarily due to amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the rsc acquisition accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased by 45  or 103  percent from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013  primarily due to lease and severance payments associated with closed locations and a reduction in the bonus accrual subordinated convertible debentures decreased by 55  or 1000  percent from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013  due to the retirement of 55  principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

during 2013  and 2012 we took a number of actions related to our capital structure to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

  37 

in september 2013 we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility 

 as previously announced in 2013 our board authorized a 500 share repurchase program our intention is to complete such program within 18 months after the october 2013 announcement as of january 20 2014  we have repurchased 15 of holdings common stock under such program additionally in connection with the rsc acquisition our board authorized a stock buyback of up to 200 of holdings common stock which we intended to complete within 18 months after the april 30 2012 closing of the rsc acquisition and completed as of december 31 2013 during the year ended december 31 2013  we repurchased 85 of holdings common stock under this program 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2013  we had i  1142  of borrowing capacity net of  52  of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii  53  of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of  175  cash equivalents at december 31 2013  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2013   1106  and  430  were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility respectively the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2013  were 25  percent and 08  percent respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities were  1187  and  450  respectively and the weightedaverage interest rates thereon were 23  percent and 08  percent respectively the maximum monthend amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities during the year ended december 31 2013  were  1478  and  494  respectively the maximum amount outstanding under the abl facility exceeded the average amount outstanding during the year primarily due to borrowings related to purchases of rental equipment and payment of other expenses 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service v acquisitions and vi share repurchases we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 20 2014  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in 2013  relative to 2012  net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  109 billion  and  873  in 2013  and 2012  respectively we expect net rental capital expenditures of approximately 115  billion and gross rental purchases of approximately 165  billion in 2014  

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility and the senior notes any failure to be in 

 38 

compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

as discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and 150 since the october 2011 amendment of the facility and through december 31 2013  availability under the facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 

urna’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2013  we i generated cash from operating activities of  1551  and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  516  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  1684  ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of  160  and iii purchase shares of our common stock for 115  during 2012 we i generated cash from operating activities of 721 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 430 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 1643 including 2825 of proceeds from debt issuances associated with the rsc acquisition a portion of which was used to repay certain of rscs senior debt we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 1369 ii purchase other companies for 1175 including cash paid for the rsc acquisition iii purchase shares of our common stock for 131 and iv pay financing costs of 75 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow usage” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements net management believes that free cash flow usage provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow usage is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow usage should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow usage 

  



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2013  was  383  an increase  of  606  as compared to free cash usage of 223  for the year ended december 31 2012  free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  includes aggregate cash payments of 38 and 150 respectively related to merger and restructuring activity free cash flow increased primarily due to increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased purchases of rental equipment free cash usage for the year ended december 31 2012 was 223 a decrease of 246 as compared to free cash flow of 23 for the year ended december 31 2011 free cash usage increased primarily due to increased purchases of rental and nonrental equipment partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment and nonrental equipment and increased net cash provided by operating activities we expect free cash flow in the range of 400  to 450  in 2014  and intend to use this to reduce our leverage and to fund our share repurchase program discussed above 

 39 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2013

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2013  we had an aggregate of  1536  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of  1106  of borrowings under the abl facility and  430  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2013  were i 25  percent for the abl facility and ii 08  percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2013  

 40 

based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  9  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2013  we had an aggregate of  56  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2013  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see notes 11  see “fair value of financial instruments” and 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2013  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 11 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk   in connection with the november 2009 4 percent convertible notes offering holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cost 26 and decreased additional paidin capital by 17 net of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity deficit the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 103  million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock at issuance the effective conversion price is subject to change in certain circumstances such as if the 4 percent convertible notes are converted prior to may 15 2015 in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds the effective conversion price per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was  7500  or  8000  per share assuming an effective conversion price of 1556 per share on a net basis we would issue 113  million or 115  million shares respectively based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2013  holders of the 4 percent convertible notes have the right to redeem the notes during the first quarter of 2014  at a conversion price of 1111 per share of common stock since january 1 2014  the beginning of the first quarter none of the 4 percent convertible senior notes were redeemed however we have received redemption not ices for  56  of the 4 percent convertible senior notes which we expect to be redeemed in the first quarter of 2014 

if the total 156  outstanding principal amount of the 4 percent convertible notes was converted the total cost to settle the notes would be  1094  assuming a conversion price of 7795  the closing price of our common stock on december 31 2013  per share of common stock the 156  principal amount would be settled in cash and the remaining  938  could be settled in cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our discretion based on the december 31 2013  closing stock price approximately 12  million shares of stock excluding any stock we would receive from the option counterparties as discussed below would be issued if we settled the entire  938  of conversion value in excess of the principal amount in stock the total cost to settle would change approximately 14  for each  1  actual dollars change in our stock price if the full principal amount was converted at our december 31 2013  closing stock price we estimate that we would receive approximately  43  in either cash or stock from the option counterparties after which the effective conversion price would be approximately 1417

general 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 836  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities we offer approximately 3300  classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities in 2012  we generated total revenues of 41  billion including 35  billion of equipment rental revenue 

as of december 31 2012  our fleet of rental equipment included approximately 400000  units the total original equipment cost of our fleet “oec” based on the initial consideration paid was 72  billion at december 31 2012  compared with 40 billion at december 31 2011  our fleet at december 31 2012  includes fleet acquired in the acquisition of rsc holdings inc “rsc” discussed below the fleet includes 

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used equipment as well as related parts and service and contractor supplies 

acquisition of rsc 

on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest “the acquisition” of rsc the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date rsc which had total revenues of 15 billion in 2011 was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america and as of december 31 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 us states and three canadian provinces the acquisition has created a leading north american equipment rental company with a more attractive business mix greater scale and enhanced growth prospects and we believe that the acquisition will provide us with financial benefits including reduced operating expenses and additional revenue opportunities going forward for additional information concerning the rsc acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

strategy 

for the past several years we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion to achieve this objective we have developed a strategy focused on customer service differentiation customer segmentation rate management fleet management and disciplined cost control this strategy calls for a consistently superior standard of service to customers often provided through a single point of contact an increasing 

proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets and the profitable deployment of our rental assets for optimal return on investment 

in 2012 we adopted the american rental association criteria for rental rates time utilization and oec comparisons to prior years are based on a recast of these metrics on the same basis 

although uncertainty in the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the north american equipment rental industry in 2012  we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy for the full year 2012  compared with 2011  these achievements included 

 in 2013  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process enhanced customer service capabilities and sustained cost efficiencies in particular we will focus on 

 industry overview and economic outlook 

we serve three principal end markets for equipment rental in north america industrialnonconstruction commercial or private nonresidential construction and residential in 2012  based on an analysis of our charge customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

 2 

 we believe that overall us construction activity in 2012  was relatively strong but was still well below historic levels we estimate that overall us construction activity in 2012  grew approximately 10 percent on a yearoveryear basis in this environment compared with the prior year our rental rates increased 69  percent on a pro forma basis and our volume of oec on rent which significantly benefited from the impact of the rsc acquisition increased 632  percent we believe that these two metrics reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a combination of positive factors a relatively strong improvement in our operating environment a secular shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment and the benefit of our strategy particularly our increased focus on national accounts and other large customers although there is no certainty that these trends will continue we believe that our strategy has already put us in a position to capitalize on our industry leadership and customer service differentiation in a continuing recovery 

in 2013  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover specifically in 2013  we expect that the us equipment rental industry will achieve yearoveryear revenue growth in the mid to high single digits 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment we believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repairs and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet the optimum time to dispose of an asset our fleet age which is calculated on an oecweighted basis was 472  months at december 31 2012  compared with 503 months at december 31 2011  at december 31 2012  91 percent  of our fleet was current on its manufacturers recommended maintenance 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory during the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  60  percent and 55 percent respectively of our equipment rental revenues were derived from accounts including national accounts and other key accounts that are managed by a single point of contact 2012  national account revenues are only available on a pro forma basis that is assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for the full year 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies

sales of rental equipment   we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment consistent with the lifecycle approach we use to manage our fleet the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the market for used equipment the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand 

we utilize many channels to sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america at auction through brokers and directly to manufacturers we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale 

sales of new equipment  we sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers the manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include genie jlg and skyjack aerial lifts multiquip wacker and honda usa compaction equipment generators and pumps sullair compressors skytrak and jlg rough terrain reach forklifts takeuchi skidsteer loaders terex telehandlers and dewalt generators the type of new equipment that we sell varies by location 

contractor supplies sales  we sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies our target customers for contractor supplies are our existing rental customers 

service and other revenues  we also offer repair maintenance and rental protection services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers our target customers for these types of ancillary services are our current rental customers as well as those who purchase both new and used equipment from our branches 

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners in 2012  our largest customer accounted for approximately one percent of our revenues on a pro forma basis that is assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for the full year and our top 10 customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately five percent of our pro forma revenues 

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 27 percent of our 2012  purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 68 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our ibm system i™ system located at our data center rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day 

these systems

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate 12 percent market share based on 2012  equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association “ara” our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of 

customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

we have approximately 11300  employees of these approximately 3500  are salaried personnel and approximately 7800  are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 80  separate locations cover approximately 800  of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

combining our business with rscs business may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected which may adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our stock 

the success of the rsc acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business and rscs business if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees and suppliers or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of rsc into our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include among other things 

 7 

 

the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual synergies if achieved at all may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to adequately address these challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate rscs operations into ours or to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of rsc which could have an adverse effect on our revenues level of expenses and operating results which may adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the recent economic downturn and resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge a slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our rental equipment is used significantly in private nonresidential construction which is cyclical in nature trench safety power and hvac equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities over the past several years our industry has experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity although in 2012  we saw modest improvements in the pace of the recovery that began late in the first quarter of 2010 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized and could lead to further decreases such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced while many areas of the global economy are improving a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 8 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in many cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 

our current level of indebtedness exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2012  our total indebtedness was 74  billion including  55  million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 9 

 we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2012  we had 16  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 22  percent of our total indebtedness including our subordinated convertible debentures see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries current debt the related risks that we now face could intensify 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda as such ratios are described in the agreement governing our abl facility as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and 150 million since the october 2011 amendment of our abl facility and through december 31 2012  availability under the abl facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding as such ratios and tests are described in the agreement governing our accounts receivable securitization facility if we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries such covenants include among other things limitations on 1 liens 2 saleleaseback transactions 3 indebtedness 4 mergers consolidations and acquisitions 5 sales transfers and other dispositions of assets 6 loans and other investments 7 dividends and other distributions stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments 8 dividends other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries 9 transactions with affiliates and 10 issuances of disqualified capital stock future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions 

these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us whether favored or opposed by our management andor our board of directors 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures we cannot assure you that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to us 

a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt as well as any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies andor to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable if our debt is accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt 

the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

              the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder as a result our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date as well as certain discretionary rights of the agents in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value the inability to borrow under our abl facility may adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial position 

we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2012  we had 30  billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our 

goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results 

we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected for instance during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 million related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflected adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as workers compensation claims it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we have made acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions that we may pursue in the future 

we have historically achieved a portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 12 

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2013  and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses 

insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate issues such as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 724  branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our unionrepresented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability 

we currently have approximately 800  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 10500  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the unionrepresented workers of various unrelated companies under the employee retirement income security act a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable generally upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liability we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan however there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world our customer service network consists of 836  rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  72  billion and a national branch network that operates in 49 us states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently wellmaintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3300  classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues in 2012  equipment rental revenues represented 84  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion to achieve this objective we have developed a strategy focused on customer service differentiation customer segmentation rate management fleet management and disciplined cost control this strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers often provided through a single point of contact an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets and the profitable deployment of our rental assets for optimal return on investment 

on april 30 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest “the acquisition” of rsc holdings inc “rsc” the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date rsc which had total revenues of 15 billion in 2011 was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america and as of december 31 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 us states and three canadian provinces the acquisition has created a leading north american equipment rental company with a more attractive business mix greater scale and enhanced growth prospects and we believe that the acquisition will provide us with financial benefits including reduced operating expenses and additional revenue opportunities going forward since the acquisition date significant amounts of fleet have been moved between united rentals locations and the acquired rsc locations and it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amounts of revenue and earnings of rsc since the acquisition date the impact of the rsc acquisition on our equipment rentals revenue is primarily reflected in the 632  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent in 2012 for additional information concerning the rsc acquisition see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2012 we adopted the american rental association criteria for rental rates time utilization and oec comparisons to prior years are based on a recast of these metrics on the same basis 

although uncertainty in the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the north american equipment rental industry in 2012  we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy for the full year 2012  compared with 2011  these achievements included 

 21 

point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory 

 in 2013  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process enhanced customer service capabilities and sustained cost efficiencies in particular we will focus on 

 in 2013  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover specifically in 2013  we expect that the us equipment rental industry will achieve yearoveryear revenue growth in the mid to high single digits 

financial overview 

despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions and as discussed elsewhere in this report we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in 2012  and 2011  related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include 

 these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery as of december 31 2012  we had available liquidity of  782  including cash of  106  

income loss from continuing operations  income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  were as follows 

  



income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  include the impacts of the following special items amounts presented on an aftertax basis 

  



  

 23 

in addition to the matters discussed above our 2012  performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment as discussed below see “results of operations income taxes” our results for 2012 reflect a tax provision of 13  which equates to an effective tax rate of 148 percent  and our results for 2010 include a tax benefit of 41 which equates to an effective tax rate of 651 percent 

ebitda gaap reconciliations   ebitda represents the sum of net income loss loss from discontinued operation net of taxes provision benefit for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the rsc merger related costs restructuring charge stock compensation expense net the impact of the fair value markup of the acquired rsc fleet and inventory and the gain on sale of software subsidiary these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliation provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 

the table below provides a reconciliation between net income loss and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

 for the year ended december 31 2012  ebitda increased  622  or 708  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  843  or 907  percent the ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by the impact of the rsc merger related costs and restructuring charge and increased selling general and administrative expense and the adjusted ebitda increase primarily reflects increased profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2012  ebitda margin increased 28  percentage points to 365  percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 74  percentage points to 430  percent the increase in ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage partially offset by the impact of the rsc merger related costs and restructuring charge the increase in adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2012 also include the impact of  104  of cost savings from operating efficiencies and synergies achieved subsequent to the rsc acquisition we expect to achieve approximately 200  of additional cost savings related to the acquisition in 2013 

for the year ended december 31 2011  ebitda increased  230  or 354  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  238  or 344  percent primarily reflecting increased profit from equipment rentals for the year ended december 31 2011  ebitda margin increased 47  percentage points to 337  percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 47  percentage points to 356  percent primarily reflecting increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  were as follows 

  



equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services including parts sales 

2012  total revenues of  41  billion increased 577  percent compared with total revenues of  26  billion in 2011  the increase reflects a 606  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 632  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 69  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals 1 the type of equipment rented and 2 the duration of the rental contract daily weekly and monthly in 2012 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2012  reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates weighted by the prior period revenue mix additionally sales of rental equipment increased 918  percent primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing in a stronger retail market and the impact of the rsc acquisition 

2011  total revenues of  26  billion increased 167  percent compared with total revenues of  22  billion in 2010  the increase primarily reflects a 173  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 145 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 53 percent rental rate increase and a 444  percent increase in sales of rental equipment which was primarily due to increased volume improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the 

monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  26  and 16 as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  24  10 and 12 for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  89  or  119  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  9  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  13  or  20  respectively 

purchase price allocation  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past including the acquisition of rsc in 2012 and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition long lived assets principally rental equipment and goodwill generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions in addition to goodwill the intangible assets that we have acquired are noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed noncompete agreements customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 

when we make an acquisition we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires 

judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions within our industry including our own acquisitions we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting units net assets is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

business projections we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a tenyear planning period that are updated at least annually 

longterm growth rates beyond the planning period we also utilize an assumed longterm growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting units earnings stream is projected to grow these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during our tenyear planning period and 

discount rates our combined future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants the weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interestbearing liabilities and operating metrics eg revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies within our industry including our own acquisitions 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment this guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we early adopted this guidance and in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2011 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts after reaching this conclusion no further testing was performed the qualitative factors we considered included but were not limited to general economic conditions our outlook for construction activity our recent and forecasted financial performance and the price of the companys common stock in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1 2012 we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

as of october 1 2012 our annual goodwill impairment testing date we had 30 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet of which 27 billion arose from the rsc acquisition our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 15 percent in connection with this impairment testing we generally utilized a discount rate of 90 percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of 30 percent beyond our planning period we also performed sensitivity analyses related to the discount rate and longterm growth rate specifically we stress tested our results under the following three scenarios i increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points ii reducing the longterm growth rate to 20 percent and iii increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points and reducing the 

longterm growth rate to 20 percent in each of these three scenarios the fair values still exceeded the carrying values for each reporting unit 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we recognized asset impairment charges of  15  4 and 9 respectively in our general rentals segment the impairment charges primarily represent writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the restructuring activity discussed below and are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as of december 31 2012  and 2011  there were no heldforsale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold we select these assets which represented approximately four percent of our total rental assets at december 31 2012  as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment as part of this impairment review we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed december 31 2012  quarterly review there was no impairment associated with these assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels as discussed below during the fourth quarters of 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized a benefit of 6  a benefit of 8 and a charge of 24 respectively related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety power and hvac the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial and industrial equipment general tools and light equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench safety power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety power and hvac segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 4  to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our 12 geographic regions—eastern canada gulf south industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence midatlantic midcentral midwest mountain west northeast northwest south southeast and southwest—into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2012  certain of our regions had equipment rentals gross margins that varied by between 10 percent and 23  percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period for the year ended december 31 2012  the aggregate general rentals equipment rentals gross margin increased 60  percentage points to 389  percent primarily reflecting increased rental rates a 03  percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet and cost improvements as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of 632  percent i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 454 percent due primarily to higher rental volume ii compensation costs increased 441 percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition and iii building and property costs increased 323 percent due primarily to the impact of the rsc acquisition our equipment rental revenue increased more than our costs because rates—which were a significant driver of the yearoveryear revenue improvement—result in fewer variable costs compared to utilization 

for the five year period ended december 31 2012  the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was the southeast  the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 268  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2012  was 23  percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin was less than the other general rentals regions during this period as it experienced more significant declines in its end markets than the other regions which led to more competitive pricing pressure and lower fleet investment for the year ended december 31 2012  the southeast  regions equipment rentals gross margin increased 74  percentage points to 344  percent primarily reflecting a 59  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis and cost improvements partially offset by a 05  percentage point decrease in time utilization as compared to equipment rentals revenue which increased 540  percent i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 309 percent due primarily to higher rental volume ii compensation costs increased 412 percent and iii building and property costs increased 234 percent 

for the five year period ended december 31 2012  the general rentals region with the highest equipment rentals gross margin was the south  the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin of 380  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2012  was 11  percent more than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin was more than the other general rentals regions during this period as its end markets grew faster than the other regions which resulted in stronger pricing for the year ended december 31 2012  the south  regions equipment rentals gross margin increased 104  percentage points to 460  percent primarily reflecting a 94  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis and cost improvements partially offset by a 16  percentage point decrease in time utilization as compared to equipment rentals revenue which increased 1333  percent including the impact of the rsc acquisition i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased 820 percent due primarily to higher rental volume ii compensation costs increased 931 percent and iii building and property costs increased 383 percent 

although the margins for certain of our general rentals regions exceeded a 10 percent variance level for the five year period ended december 31 2012  we expect convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the construction industry which impacts each region differently and our continued focus on cost cutting improved processes and fleet sharing additionally the margins for the five year period ended december 31 2012  include the significant impact of the economic downturn in 2009 that impacted all our regions for the year ended december 31 2012  the largest variance from the aggregated general rentals regions margin was 16 percent as compared to 23  percent for the five year period ended december 31 2012  although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows   



equipment rentals 2012  equipment rentals of  35  billion increased  13 billion  or 606  percent as compared to 2011  primarily reflecting a 632  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 69  percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis partially offset by changes in rental mix in 2012 we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs we believe that the rate and volume improvements for 2012  reflect in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment as discussed above we acquired rsc on april 30 2012 and the results of rscs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent equipment rentals represented 84  percent of total revenues in 2012  on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 83  percent and 90  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  1235  or 632  percent primarily reflecting a 636 percent  increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates partially offset by an increase in the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts

nonrental depreciation and amortization  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  was as follows   



nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i the amortization of other intangible assets and ii depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships noncompete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks nonrental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2012  increased primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of rsc discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  was as follows   



interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012   increased  by  284  or 125  percent as discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements in march 2012  we issued 2825  of debt the merger financing notes in connection with the rsc acquisition upon completion of the rsc acquisition we also assumed rscs debt that remained after repayment of certain of rscs debt interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012  includes 29  of interest recorded on the merger financing notes prior to the closing of the merger additionally during 2012  we redeemed our 10 7  8  percent senior notes and all of our outstanding 1 7  8 percent convertible senior subordinated notes were converted upon redemptionconversion we recognized a loss of 72  in interest expense net the loss represents the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchaseconversion price of these securities in addition to these matters interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2012  increased primarily due to increased average outstanding debt including the debt issued and assumed in connection with the rsc acquisition as compared to 2011 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased by 27 or 11 percent interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2011 includes a loss of 3 primarily related to writeoffs of debt issuance costs associated with the october 2011 amendment of our abl facility interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 includes a loss of 28 related to repurchases or redemptions of 1273 principal amount of our outstanding debt excluding the impact of these losses interest expense net decreased slightly as the impact of a slight increase in average outstanding debt was offset by the impact of lower interest rates 

interest expense—subordinated convertible debentures net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  was as follows   



as discussed further in note 13  to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued quips this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was  55  interest expense subordinated convertible debentures net for 2011  includes a 2 loss recognized in connection with the simultaneous purchase of 69 of quips and retirement of 69 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures 

other income net  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  was as follows   



the increase in other income net for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily reflects an 8  gain recognized upon the sale of a former subsidiary that developed and marketed software

we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

during 2012  we took a number of actions related to our capital structure to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions which are discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements include

 as previously announced in connection with the rsc acquisition our board authorized a stock buyback of up to 200 of holdings common stock as of january 21 2013  we have repurchased  115  of holdings common stock and our intent is to complete the stock buyback within 18 months after the april 30 2012 closing of the rsc acquisition 

total debt at december 31 2012   increased  by  4322  or 1447  percent as compared to december 31 2011  primarily due to additional borrowings and debt assumed in connection with the rsc acquisition shortterm debt at december 31 2012  primarily reflects  453  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and  137  of 4 percent convertible senior notes the 4 percent convertible senior notes mature in 2015 but are reflected as shortterm debt because they were redeemable at december 31 2012  

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2012  we had i  654  of borrowing capacity net of  62  of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii  22  of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of  106  cash equivalents at december 31 2012  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2012   1184  and  453  were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility respectively the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2012  were 23  percent and 09  percent respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities were  1138  and  315  respectively and the weightedaverage interest rates thereon were 23  percent and 09  percent respectively the maximum monthend amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities during the year ended december 31 2012  were  1287  and  475  respectively the maximum amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility exceeded the average amounts outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings following the rsc acquisition 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service and v acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 21 2013  were as follows   



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in 2012  relative to 2011  net rental 

capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  873  and  566  in 2012  and 2011  respectively we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in 2013  relative to 2012  we expect net rental capital expenditures of approximately 105 billion and gross rental purchases of approximately 15 billion in 2013  

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility the senior notes and the quips any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

as discussed in note 12  to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and 150 since the october 2011 amendment of the facility and through december 31 2012  availability under the facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 

as of december 31 2012  urna had limited restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this limited capacity restricts our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2012  we i generated cash from operating activities of  721  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  430  and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  1643  including 2825  of proceeds from debt issuances associated with the rsc acquisition a portion of which was used to repay certain of rscs senior debt we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  1369  ii purchase other companies for  1175  including cash paid for the rsc acquisition iii purchase shares of our common stock for 131  and iv pay financing costs of 75  during 2011 we i generated cash from operating activities of 612 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 221 and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of 79 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 810 and ii purchase other companies for 276 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash usage flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements net management believes that free cash usage flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash usage flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash usage flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash usage flow 

  



free cash usage for the year ended december 31 2012  was  223  a decrease  of  246  as compared to free cash flow of 23  for the year ended december 31 2011  free cash usage increased primarily due to increased purchases of rental and nonrental equipment partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment and nonrental equipment and increased 

net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2011 was 23 a decrease of 204 as compared to 227 for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 included a 55 federal tax refund excluding the impact of this refund free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased purchases of rental equipment partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment we expect significant positive free cash flow in 2013  and intend to use this to reduce our leverage 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2012

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2012  we had an aggregate of  1637  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of  1184  of borrowings under the abl facility and  453  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2012  were i 23  percent for the abl facility and ii 09  percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2012  based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  12  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2012  we had an aggregate of  57  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates including our subordinated convertible debentures a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2012  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see notes 11  see “fair value of financial instruments” and 12  to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2012  relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 10 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk   in connection with the november 2009 4 percent convertible notes offering holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cost 26 and decreased additional paidin capital by 17 net of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity deficit the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 151  million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock at issuance the effective conversion price is subject to change in certain circumstances such as if the 4 percent convertible notes are converted prior to may 15 2015 in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds the effective conversion price per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offs et the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was  4000  or  4500  per share assuming an effective conversion price of 1556 per share on a net basis we would issue 92  million or 99  million shares respectively based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2012  holders of the 4 percent convertible notes have the right to redeem the notes during the first quarter of 2013  at a conversion price of 1111 per share of common stock between january 1 2013  the beginning of the first quarter and january 21 2013  none of the 4 percent convertible senior notes were redeemed 

if the total 168  outstanding principal amount of the 4 percent convertible notes was converted the total cost to settle the notes would be  687  assuming a conversion price of 4552  the closing price of our common stock on december 31 2012  per share of common stock the 168  principal amount would be settled in cash and the remaining  519  could be settled in cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our discretion based on the december 31 2012  closing stock price approximately 11  million shares of stock excluding any stock we would receive from the option counterparties as discussed below would be issued if we settled the entire  519  of conversion value in excess of the principal amount in stock the total cost to settle would change approximately  15  for each  1  actual dollars change in our stock price if the full principal amount was converted at our december 31 2012  closing stock price we estimate that we would receive approximately  51  in either cash or stock from the option counterparties after which the effective conversion price would be approximately 1452

strategy 

for the past several years we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion to achieve this objective we have developed a strategy focused on customer segmentation rate management fleet management and disciplined cost control additionally we are continuing to strengthen our competitiveness through customer service excellence this strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers often provided through a single point of contact an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 

although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in 2011 we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy for the full year 2011 compared with 2010 these achievements included 

 in 2012 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process the strengthening of our customer service capabilities and sustained cost efficiencies additionally we will focus on 

 industry overview and economic outlook 

we serve four principal end markets for equipment rental in north america commercial infrastructure industrial and residential in 2011 based on an analysis of our charge customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

 2 

 although overall construction activity remained weak in 2011 our performance was strong compared with the prior year our rental rates increased 61  percent and the volume of oec on rent increased 134  percent we believe these two metrics reflect a combination of positive factors a modest improvement in our operating environment a secular shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment and the benefit of our strategy particularly our increased focus on national accounts and other large customers although there is no certainty that these trends will continue we believe that our strategy has already put us in a position to capitalize on our industry leadership and customer service differentiation in a recovery 

in 2012 based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover at a modest pace specifically we estimate that us spending on private nonresidential construction our primary end market will show a singledigit percentage increase over 2011

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  we have approximately 1700  sales people including approximately 900  outside sales representatives who frequently travel to customer jobsites and meet with customers and approximately 800  inside sales representatives who work in our branches and at our customer care center our sales representatives are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships 

with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team which consists of approximately 55 sales professionals and support staff and includes those who service government agencies closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area 

erentals  our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our erentals portal which can be found at  httpwwwurcom  our customers can also use our ur data  application to access realtime reports on their business activity with us 

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history customer acceptance and financial strength we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19 percent of our 2011 purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 68 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our ibm system i™ system located at our data center rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day 

these systems 

 our information technology systems and website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists working in conjunction with our strategic technology partners and service providers this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy in 2011 we made the following investments in the area of technology 

 6 

call center credit offices and a group of pilot branches to better answer transfer and route calls to provide improved customer service and internal collaboration our voip systems allow us to route calls to other branches in the area or to our call center when all branch personnel are busy serving customers 

 each of these investments is aligned with our strategic focus on customer service and operational efficiencies 

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate nine percent market share and that the four largest companies including rsc account for approximately 24 percent of industry revenue based on 2010 equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association “ara” our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

we have approximately 7500  employees of these approximately 2500  are salaried personnel and approximately 5000  are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 65  separate locations cover approximately 650  of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

clearance of the proposed rsc merger from the canadian competition bureau the bureau may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met any delay in completing the merger with rsc due to difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other conditions may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the merger 

we must receive clearance with respect to the proposed merger with rsc although the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act expired on january 20 2012 the bureau may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement these conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger any of which might have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the completion of the merger although we and rsc have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals andor clearances we cannot provide any assurance that clearance from the bureau will be obtained or that there will not be any adverse consequences to our business or rscs business resulting from the failure to obtain the clearance or from conditions that could be imposed in connection with obtaining the clearance including divestitures or other operating restrictions upon us rsc the combined company or its subsidiaries clearance from the bureau may not be obtained in a timely manner and this could result in a delay in the consummation of the merger 

in addition to obtaining the required governmental clearances and approvals the merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control including among others receipt of approvals from our or rscs stockholders and the receipt of a solvency opinion with respect to the combined company we cannot predict whether or when the conditions required to complete the merger will be satisfied moreover rsc or uri may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated by june 15 2012 except in certain limited circumstances or if the transaction date is extended under specified circumstances rsc or uri may be required to pay significant fees to the other party in connection with the termination of the merger agreement any delay in completing the merger or failure to complete the merger as a result of such delay may materially adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger and the integration of our and rscs respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe the first half of 2012 

combining our business with rscs business following completion of the proposed merger may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected which may adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our stock following consummation of the merger 

the success of the merger with rsc will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business and rscs business if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees and suppliers or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 

issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of rsc into our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger include among other things 

 8 

 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon our revenues level of expenses and operating results which may adversely affect the value of our common stock after the completion of the merger 

in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual synergies if achieved at all may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to adequately address these challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate rscs operations into ours or to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies 

the recent economic downturn and resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge a slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have further adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our rental equipment is used primarily in the private nonresidential construction industry which is cyclical in nature trench safety power and hvac equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities over the past several years our industry has experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity and we experienced weakness in our end markets though we saw modest improvements in our operating environment in 2011 the weakness in our end markets led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge and could lead to further decreases such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced while many areas of the global economy are improving a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause further weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in many cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our or our competitors’ operating performance 

our current level of indebtedness which will increase upon completion of the rsc acquisition exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2011 our total indebtedness was approximately 30  billion including  55  million of subordinated convertible debentures in the event that the proposed merger with rsc is completed we intend to finance the cash portion of the rsc merger consideration and repay the outstanding amounts on rscs existing senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes due 2017 through new debt issuances and drawing on current loan facilities and to assume all of rscs existing unsecured debt we estimate that the principal amount of our total indebtedness will increase by approximately  37  billion following completion of the rsc merger our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 10 

 our increased indebtedness following consummation of the merger with rsc could further adversely affect our operations and liquidity in addition to increasing the foregoing risks our anticipated level of indebtedness could among other things 

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2011 we had 1065  million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates which we expect to increase following the rsc acquisition as we intend to finance a portion of the merger by drawing on our current loan facilities our variable rate indebtedness currently represents 35  percent of our total indebtedness including our subordinated convertible debentures we expect this percentage to decrease significantly following the rsc acquisition as our variable rate indebtedness will represent a smaller portion of our total indebtedness following the acquisition see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

despite our indebtedness level which will increase in connection with the acquisition of rsc following the acquisition we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness 

despite our indebtedness level which will increase following the acquisition of rsc we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness any of which could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we 

amended the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and 150 million since the october 2011 amendment date and through december 31 2011 availability under the abl facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding if we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility andor the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt restrict our ability to among other things 

 we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which may cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if any of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2011 we had 289  million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets negative 

industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results 

we have a holding company structure and we will depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings in order to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are subject to certain purported class action and stockholder litigation which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

as described in greater detail under item 3legal proceedings we are subject to certain purported class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits we can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings and regardless of the outcome we may incur significant costs including defense and indemnification costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant costs damages or settlement amounts such payments to the extent not covered advanced or timely reimbursed by insurance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims further as described elsewhere in this report several stockholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected for instance during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 million related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflected adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as worker’s compensation claims in addition the purported class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with such matters may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we have made acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions or consolidations that we may pursue in the future 

we have historically achieved a portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or 

that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

although our board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in september 2011 we still have in place certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in the past the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2012 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be 

unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

if our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs to our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment 

washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 436  branch locations in the united states are located in 48 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 650  employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 6850  employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk

tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 529  rental locations in the united states and canada although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on the initial consideration paid of  43  billion and a national branch network that operates in 48 states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is better maintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 3000  classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other in 2011 equipment rental revenues represented 82  percent of our total revenues 

for the past several years we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion to achieve this we have developed a strategy focused on customer segmentation rate management fleet management and disciplined cost control additionally we are continuing to strengthen our competitiveness through customer service excellence this strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers often provided through a single point of contact an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 

although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in 2011 we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy for the full year 2011 compared with 2010 these achievements included 

 in 2012 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process the strengthening of our customer service capabilities and sustained cost efficiencies additionally we will focus on

safety power and hvac business 

in 2012 based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover at a modest pace specifically we estimate that us spending on private nonresidential construction our primary end market will show a singledigit percentage increase over 2011 

proposed acquisition of rsc 

as discussed elsewhere in this report on december 15 2011 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with rsc pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire rsc in a cashandstock transaction that ascribes a total enterprise value of  42  billion to rsc total cash consideration is expected to be approximately  11  billion and we anticipate issuing approximately 29  million shares of common stock in the merger the cash portion of the merger will be financed through new debt issuances and drawing on current loan facilities in connection with the proposed merger we intend to repay the outstanding amounts on rscs existing senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes due 2017  which totaled  854  as of september 30 2011 and assume all of rscs remaining  14  billion of unsecured debt after such repayment the proposed merger is subject to approval by our stockholders and rsc stockholders regulatory approvals and other mutual conditions of the parties we expect the merger to close in the first half of 2012  

financial overview 

despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions and as discussed elsewhere in this report we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in 2010 and 2011 related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity for instance most recently in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the amended facility which expires on october 13 2016 provides for among other things an increase in the facility size from 136 billion to 180 billion an uncommitted incremental increase in the size of the facility of up to 500 and generally lower borrowing costs additionally in september 2011 we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility the amended facility expires on september 26 2012 and may be extended on a 364day basis by mutual agreement of the company and the purchasers under the facility the amended facility provides for among other things a decrease in the facility size from 325 to 300 adjustments to the receivables subject to purchase and generally lower borrowing costs as of december 31 2011 we had available liquidity of  972  including cash of  36

 in addition to the matters discussed above our 2011 performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment as discussed below see “results of operations income taxes” our results for 2010 also include a tax benefit of 41 which equates to an effective tax rate of 651 percent 

ebitda gaap reconciliations   ebitda represents the sum of net income loss loss from discontinued operation net of taxes provision benefit for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the rsc merger related costs the restructuring charge and stock compensation expense net these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliation provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 

the table below provides a reconciliation between net income loss and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

 for the year ended december 31 2011 ebitda increased  230  or 354  percent and adjusted ebitda increased  238  or 344  percent primarily reflecting increased profit from equipment rentals for the year ended december 31 2011 ebitda margin increased 47  percentage points to 337  percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 47  percentage points to 356  percent primarily reflecting increased margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

for the year ended december 31 2010 ebitda increased 60 or 102 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 63 or 100 percent primarily reflecting increased margins from sales of rental equipment and selling general and administrative expense reductions for the year ended december 31 2010 ebitda margin increased 40 percentage points to 290 percent and adjusted ebitda margin increased 43 percentage points to 309 percent primarily reflecting increased margins from sales of rental equipment and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

revenues  revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

  



equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2011 total revenues of  26  billion increased 167  percent compared with total revenues of 22 billion in 2010 the increase primarily reflects a 173  percent increase in equipment rentals which was primarily due to a 134  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 61  percent rental rate increase and a 444  percent increase in sales of rental equipment which was primarily due to increased volume improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates weighted by the current period revenue mix 

2010 total revenues of 22 billion decreased 51 percent compared with total revenues of 24 billion in 2009 the decrease primarily reflects a 371 percent decline in sales of rental equipment and a 215 percent decline in contractor supplies sales equipment rental revenue increased slightly as a 43 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent was largely offset by a 21 percent decrease in rental rates and other the decline in sales of rental equipment in 2010 primarily reflects a decline in the volume of equipment sold the decline in contractor supplies sales in 2010 reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are hourly daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of  16  and 12 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate 

of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  10  12 and 33 for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  42  or  54  respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately  5  any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately  7  or  9  respectively 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill  we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized asset impairment charges of  4  9 and 12 respectively in our general rentals segment the 2011 and 2010 impairment charges primarily reflected writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the consolidation of our branch network discussed below and are primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income the 2009 impairment charge includes rental fleet impairment of 9 reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as well as 3 primarily related to leasehold improvement writeoffs which are reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income the impairment charges followed from our decision to consolidate our branch network we have reduced our branch count by an aggregate of 168  branches between january 1 2008 the beginning of the restructuring period discussed in “restructuring charge” below and december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 there were no heldforsale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold we select these assets which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december 31 2011 as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment as part of this impairment review we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed december 31 2011 quarterly review there was no impairment associated with these assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the 

reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies after consideration of all these factors we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 

we use a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels as discussed below during the fourth quarters of 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized a benefit of  8  a charge of 24 and a charge of 8 respectively related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves 

legal contingencies   we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety power and hvac the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench safety power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety power and hvac segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our seven geographic regions—the southwest gulf northwest southeast midwest east and the northeast canada into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2011 certain of our regions had equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between 10 percent and 17 percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals’ regions over the same period although the margins for these regions exceeded a 10 percent variance level for this five year period we expect convergence going forward given management’s focus on cost cutting improved processes and fleet sharing although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to 

the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows 

  



equipment rentals 2011 equipment rentals of  22  billion increased  317  or 173  percent as compared to 2010 primarily reflecting a 134  percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a 61  percent rental rate increase equipment rentals represented 82  percent of total revenues in 2011 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 82  percent and 89  percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased  260  or 154  percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent and increased rental rates trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals increased  57  or 404  percent primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of oec on rent trench safety power and hvac average oec for 2011 increased 47  percent as compared to 2010 including the impact of the acquisitions described below see “acquisitions” the increases in equipment rentals and average oec reflect our strategic focus on the higher margin power and temperature control equipment rented by the trench safety power and hvac segment

2010 sga expense of 367 decreased 41 as compared to 2009 and improved by 09 percentage points as a percentage of revenue the decline in sga reflects the benefits we realized from our costsaving initiatives including reduced compensation costs professional fees and advertising expenses 

rsc merger related costs  as discussed above on december 15 2011 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with rsc pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire rsc in a cashandstock transaction that ascribes a total enterprise value of 42 billion to rsc the year ended december 31 2011 includes acquisitionrelated costs of 19  associated with the proposed merger primarily related to financial and legal advisory fees additional merger related costs are expected to be incurred in 2012 and only a portion of such costs are expected to be capitalized

31 respectively primarily reflect branch closure charges due to continuing lease obligations at vacant facilities and severance costs associated with headcount reductions between january 1 2008 the beginning of the restructuring period and december 31 2011 we reduced the number of our branches by 168  or 241  percent and reduced our headcount by approximately 3400  or 312  percent we believe that the restructuring activity is substantially complete as of december 31 2011 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

as discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued quarterly income preferred securities “quips” this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was  55  and 124 respectively interest expense subordinated convertible debentures net for 2011 includes a  2  loss recognized in connection with the simultaneous purchase of  69  of quips and retirement of  69  principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures interest expense subordinated convertible debentures net for 2009 included a 13 gain recognized in connection with the simultaneous purchase of 22 of quips and retirement of 22 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures

income taxes  the following table summarizes our continuing operations provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective tax rates for each respective period 



  

 

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 384  percent 651 percent and 439 percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items and the geographical mix of income between us and foreign and state operations the 2011 provision reflects the nondeductibility of certain costs associated with the proposed rsc acquisition the 2010 income tax benefit includes a benefit of 7 related to a correction of a deferred tax asset recognized in prior periods our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 

balance sheet  accounts receivable net increased by 87  or 231  percent from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 primarily due to increased business activity prepaid expenses and other assets increased by 38  or 1027  percent from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 primarily due to increased amounts due from certain vendors related to increased capital expenditures and cash placed in escrow related to the acquisitions described below see “acquisitions” goodwill and other intangible assets net increased by 145  or 639  percent from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 primarily due to the acquisitions described below accounts payable increased by 74  or 561  percent from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 primarily due to increased capital expenditures and increased business activity accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 55  or 264  percent from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation associated with improved profitability and increases in professional fees and other expenses associated with the proposed rsc merger and the acquisitions described below

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital markets activity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

during 2011 we purchased an aggregate of  69  of quips for  68  in connection with this transaction we retired  69  principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures and recognized a loss of  2  inclusive of the writeoff of 

capitalized debt issuance costs this loss is reflected in interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net in our consolidated statements of income during 2011 we also recognized a loss of less than 1 associated with the conversion of  5  of our 4 percent convertible senior notes this loss is reflected in interest expense net in our consolidated statements of income 

as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in september 2011 we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility the amended facility expires on september 26 2012 and may be extended on a 364day basis by mutual agreement of the company and the purchasers under the facility the amended facility provides for among other things a decrease in the facility size from 325 to 300 adjustments to the receivables subject to purchase and generally lower borrowing costs as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the amended facility which expires on october 13 2016 provides for among other things an increase in the facility size from 136 billion to 180 billion an uncommitted incremental increase in the size of the facility of up to 500 and generally lower borrowing costs we recognized a loss of 3  in interest expense net in our consolidated statements of income in connection with the amendment of our abl facility 

total debt at december 31 2011 increased  by  182  or 65  percent as compared to december 31 2010 primarily due to additional borrowings used to finance capital expenditures and the companys acquisitions current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2011 primarily reflect  255  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and  129  of 4 percent convertible senior notes the 4 percent convertible senior notes mature in 2015 but are reflected as shortterm debt because they are convertible at december 31 2011 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2011 we had i  929  of borrowing capacity net of  50  of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii  7  of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of  36  cash equivalents at december 31 2011 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2011  810  and  255  were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility respectively the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2011 were 24  percent and 09  percent respectively during the year ended december 31 2011 the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities were  707  and  230  respectively and the weightedaverage interest rates thereon were 31  percent and 14  percent respectively the maximum monthend amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility including both the former facilities and the amended facilities during the year ended december 31 2011 were  810  and  276  respectively the amount outstanding at yearend under the abl facility exceeded the average amount outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings used to finance capital expenditures and the companys acquisitions 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i cash consideration payable in the merger with rsc and the repayment of rscs senior secured debt ii operating activities and working capital iii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iv payments due under operating leases v debt service and vi other acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash and in the case of the cash consideration for the rsc acquisition and the repayment of rscs senior secured debt the incurrence of new debt in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 23 2012 were as follows 

  



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain 

in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in 2011 relative to 2010 net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were  566  and 202 in 2011 and 2010 respectively we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in 2012 relative to 2011 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility the senior notes and the quips any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

as discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in october 2011 we amended our abl facility the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and 150 since the october 2011 amendment of the facility and through december 31 2011 availability under the facility has exceeded the required threshold and as a result these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 

as of december 31 2011 primarily due to losses sustained in prior years urna had limited restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this limited capacity restricts our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings because of certain intercompany arrangements we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash  during 2011 we i generated cash from operating activities of  608  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of  225  and iii received cash from debt proceeds net of payments of  79  we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of  810  and ii purchase other companies for  276  during 2010 we i generated cash from operations of 452 including 55 related to a federal tax refund and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 151 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 374 and ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of 183 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements net management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

  



free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2011 was  23  a decrease  of  204  as compared to 227 for the year ended december 31 2010 as noted above net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 included a 55 federal tax refund excluding the impact of this refund free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased 

purchases of rental equipment partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment in 2010 free cash flow decreased 140 compared to 2009 excluding the impact of the 55 refund noted above the yearoveryear decrease in free cash flow primarily reflected increased purchases of rental equipment and reduced proceeds from sales of rental equipment 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

  



  

 

 certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements  we lease real estate and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of some of our nonrental equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 10 under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees however we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2011 or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its 

operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2011 we had an aggregate of  1065  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of  810  of borrowings under the abl facility and  255  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2011 were i 24  percent for the abl facility and ii 09  percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2011 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately  7  for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2011 we had an aggregate of  20  billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates including our subordinated convertible debentures a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2011 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately five  percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see notes 11 see “fair value of financial instruments” and 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2011 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 6 as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized foreign currency losses of  4  associated with the revaluation of certain canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans however these losses were offset by gains of  4  recognized on forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars and the aggregate foreign currency impact of the intercompany loans and forward contracts did not have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk   in connection with the november 2009 4 percent convertible notes offering holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cost 26 and decreased additional paidin capital by 17 net of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity deficit the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 151  million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock at issuance the effective conversion price is subject to change in certain circumstances such as if the 4 percent convertible notes are converted prior to may 15 2015 in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds the effective conversion price per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was  3000  or  3500  per share assuming an effective conversion price of 1556 per share on a net basis we would issue 73  million or 84  million shares respectively based on the price of our common stock during 2011 holders of the 4 percent convertible notes had the right to convert the notes during each of the quarters in 2011 at a conversion price of 1111 per share of common stock during the year ended december 31 2011  5  of the 4 percent convertible notes were converted at an effective conversion price of  1370  upon conversion of these notes we received  1  from the hedge counterparties and recognized a  1  increase in additional paidin capital additionally upon conversion of these notes additional paidin capital was reduced by  7  reflecting the excess of the cash transferred upon settlement over the  5  principal amount of the converted notes based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2011 holders of the 4 percent convertible notes have the right to convert the notes during the first quarter of 2012 at a conversion price of 1111 per share of common stock between january 1 2012 the beginning of the first quarter and january 23 2012 none of the 4 percent convertible senior notes were converted 

if the total 168  outstanding principal amount of the 4 percent convertible notes was converted the total cost to settle the notes would be  446  assuming a conversion price of 2955  the closing price of our common stock on december 31 2011  per share of common stock the 168  principal amount would be settled in cash and the remaining  278  could be settled in cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our discretion based on the december 31 2011  closing stock price approximately 9  million shares of stock would be issued if we settled the entire  278  of conversion value in excess of the principal amount in stock the total cost to settle would change approximately  15  for each  1  actual dollars change in our stock price if the full principal amount was converted at our december 31 2011  closing stock price we estimate that we would receive approximately  40  in either cash or stock from the hedge counterparties after which the effective conversion price would be approximately 1378  additionally  22  principal amount of our 1 7  8 percent convertible notes were outstanding at december 31 2011  if the total  22  outstanding principal amount of the 1 7  8 percent convertible notes was converted the total cost to settle the notes would be  30  assuming a conversion price of 2955  the closing price of our common stock on december 31 2011 per share of common stock the total cost to settle would change approximately  1  for each  1  actual dollars change in our stock price the 1 7  8 percent convertible notes were not convertible at december 31 2011

 item 1 business tableend general 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of 531 rental locations in the united states and canada we offer approximately 2900 classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities in 2010 we generated total revenues of 22 billion including 18 billion of equipment rental revenue 

as of december 31 2010 our fleet of rental equipment included over 210000 units the total original equipment cost of our fleet “oec” based on initial consideration paid was 38 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 the fleet includes 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used equipment as well as related contractor supplies parts and service 

  

strategy 

for the past several years our strategy has focused on generating significant free cash flow and positioning our business for disciplined growth of revenues and earnings at higher margins the implementation of this strategy calls for a superior standard of customer service an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 

four key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core business of equipment rental the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network both in terms of composition and management responsible rate management and greater efficiency in all areas of operation as evidenced by a significant reduction in costs 

although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in 2010 we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy these achievements include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2011 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process the strengthening of our customer service capabilities and sustained cost controls additionally we will focus on 

 

  

   

  

  

 industry overview and economic outlook 

we serve four principal endmarkets for equipment rental in north america commercial infrastructure industrial and residential in 2010 based on an analysis of our charge customers’ standard industrial classification “sic” codes 

 

  

  

  

 as we entered 2010 our operating environment continued to be challenged by the economic events of the prior 18 months the financial crisis and consequent credit restrictions the widespread recession and a severe downturn in nonresidential construction activity of unprecedented depth and duration 

late in the first quarter of 2010 we began to see signs of a recovery in some of our end markets this recovery continued at a modest level through the remainder of the year we believe that our performance in the second half of 2010—which included a 12 percent yearoveryear increase in the volume of our equipment on rent—primarily reflects cyclical improvements in our operating environment in addition we believe that the economic environment—which was characterized by tight credit markets and cautious customer behavior—helped create a wave of firsttime renters and that some of these renters will not return to purchasing equipment when the pace of construction activity accelerates 

in 2011 based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect the recovery in our end markets to continue at a modest pace in particular we estimate that us nonresidential construction activity our primary end market will increase in the midsingle digit percent range yearoveryear in 2011 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment we believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

  

we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repairs and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with this type of equipment the optimum time to dispose of an asset our fleet age which is calculated on a unitweighted basis was 477 months at december 31 2010 compared with 424 months at december 31 2009 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs equipment rental revenues from national account customers were approximately 575 million and 500 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively and represented approximately 31 and 27 percent of our total equipment rental revenues in 2010 and 2009 respectively with our continued focus on large national accounts we expect this percentage to increase over time 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

 

  

  

 information technology systems  we have a wide variety of information technology systems some proprietary and some licensed that support our operations this information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of information technology specialists that supports our systems

strong and motivated branch management  each of our fullservice branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them within budgetary guidelines to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters each regional office has a management team that monitors branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews

sales of rental equipment  we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment in accordance with the lifecycle approach we use to manage our fleet the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the market for used equipment the age of the fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements as well as local demand 

  

we utilize many channels to sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america at auction through brokers and directly to manufacturers we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale in addition we hold united rentals certified auctions on ebay to provide customers with another convenient online tool for purchasing used equipment

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners in 2010 our largest customer accounted for less than one percent of our revenues and our top 10 customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately four percent of our revenues historically over 90 percent of our business each year as measured by equipment rental revenues has been generated from previous customers 

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 

  

  

  

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

  

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  we have approximately 1700 sales people including approximately 900 outside sales representatives who frequently travel to customer jobsites and meet with customers and approximately 800 inside sales representatives who work in our branches and at our customer care center our sales representatives are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team which consists of approximately 55 sales professionals and support staff and includes those who service government agencies closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area 

erentals  our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our erentals portal which can be found at httpwwwurcom our customers can also use our ur data ® application to access realtime reports on their business activity with us 

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history and financial strength we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19 percent of our 2010 purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our ibm system i™ system located at our data center rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day 

these systems 

 

  

  

   

our information technology systems and website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists working in conjunction with our strategic technology partners and service providers this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy in 2010 we made the following investments in the area of technology 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these investments is aligned with our strategic focus on customer service and operational efficiencies 

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

  

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate nine percent market share and that the four largest companies account for approximately 23 percent of industry revenue based on 2009 revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association “ara” our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share however may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

we have approximately 7300 employees of these approximately 2500 are salaried personnel and approximately 4800 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 50 separate locations cover approximately 600 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

  

the recent economic downturn and resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities adversely affected our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment and the prices that we could charge a slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have further adverse effects on our revenues and operating results 

our rental equipment is used primarily in the nonresidential construction industry which is cyclical in nature trench safety power and hvac equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities over the past several years our industry has experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity and we experienced weakness in our end markets this weakness in our end markets has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge and could lead to further decreases such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced while many areas of the global economy are improving a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities could cause further weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years in many cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our or our competitors’ operating performance 

our substantial debt exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2010 our total indebtedness was approximately 29 billion including 124 million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 

  

  

   

  

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 

  

  

  

  

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2010 we had 904 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represents 31 percent of our total indebtedness including our subordinated convertible debentures see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

despite our current indebtedness levels we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

despite our current indebtedness levels we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future we are not fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness any of which actions could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in certain of our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda both of these covenants were suspended on june 9 2009 because the availability as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility had exceeded 20 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility since the june 9 2009 suspension date and through december 31 2010 availability under the abl facility has exceeded 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and as a result these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding if we are unable to satisfy these or any other of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor other agreements governing our debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance 

  

the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility in addition to financial covenants various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and in the other agreements governing our debt among our things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business which subjects us to risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which may cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if any of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

  

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results 

at december 31 2010 we had 198 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset negative industry or economic trends andor significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results 

we have a holding company structure and we will depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we will depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings in order to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

multiple purported class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against the company as described in greater detail under item 3—legal proceedings these include three complaints that were filed following our november 14 2007 announcement that affiliates of cerberus capital management lp “cerberus” had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement entered into with such persons these complaints have been consolidated plaintiffs’ second consolidated amended complaint alleges among other things that certain of the company’s filings with the sec including proxy materials in connection with the special meeting of stockholders and other public statements contained false and misleading statements andor material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with affiliates of cerberus the second consolidated amended complaint asserts claims under section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” and sec rule 10b5 thereunder and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the second consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages costs expenses and fees on august 24 2009 the united states district court for the district of connecticut granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the second consolidated amended complaint with prejudice and entered a judgment in favor of defendants on august 30 2010 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the judgment of dismissal entered by the district court on september 13 2010 plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc or panel rehearing we can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings or any other stockholder lawsuit pending against the company and if we do not prevail we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts further regardless of the outcome we may incur significant defense and indemnification costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs damages or settlement amounts such payments to the extent not covered advanced or timely reimbursed by insurance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims further as 

  

described elsewhere in this report several stockholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance we could have to significantly increase our reserves and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 million related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflects recent adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as worker’s compensation claims in addition the purported class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with such matters may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we have made acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions or consolidations that we may make in the future 

we have historically achieved a portion of our growth through acquisitions although we have not made many acquisitions in recent years we will consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or have been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions acquisitions entail certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our rights plan and charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

we have in place a stockholders’ rights plan and certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices as previously reported on october 16 2008 we amended our rights plan to reduce the beneficial ownership threshold required to trigger rights under the plan from a 25 percent ownership interest to a 15 percent ownership interest we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers we are also continuing to pursue our overall cost reduction program which resulted in substantial cost savings in 2009 and further savings in 2010 the extent to which these strategies will achieve our 

  

desired efficiencies and goals in 2011 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to the company or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

as our rental fleet ages our operating costs may increase we may be unable to pass along such costs and our earnings may decrease the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis 

if our rental equipment ages the costs of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time will likely increase the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations 

the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs to our suppliers or other factors beyond our control such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods furthermore changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors that operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting 

  

our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our 446 branch locations in the united states are located in 48 states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 600 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 6700 employees who are not represented by unions various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs 

  

to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against rising andor declining fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated tableend executive overview 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 531 rental locations in the united states and canada although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost “oec” of 38 billion and a national branch network that operates in 48 states and every canadian province and serves 99 of the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the united states in addition our size gives us greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services the ability to provide customers with equipment that is better maintained and therefore more productive and reliable and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 

we offer approximately 2900 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and government entities our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of used rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other in 2010 equipment rental revenues represented 82 percent of our total revenues 

as we entered 2010 our operating environment continued to be challenged by the economic events of the prior 18 months the financial crisis and consequent credit restrictions the widespread recession and a severe downturn in nonresidential construction activity of unprecedented depth and duration 

late in the first quarter of 2010 we began to see signs of a recovery in some of our end markets this recovery continued at a modest level through the remainder of the year we believe that our performance in the second half of 2010—which included a 12 percent yearoveryear increase in the volume of our equipment on rent—primarily reflects cyclical improvements in our operating environment in addition we believe that the economic environment—which was characterized by tight credit markets and cautious customer behavior—helped create a wave of firsttime renters and that some of these renters will not return to purchasing equipment when the pace of construction activity accelerates 

in 2011 based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators we expect the recovery in our end markets to continue at a modest pace in particular we estimate that us nonresidential construction activity our primary end market will increase in the midsingle digit percent range yearoveryear in 2011 

for the past several years our strategy has focused on generating significant free cash flow and positioning our business for disciplined growth of revenues and earnings at higher margins the implementation of this strategy calls for a superior standard of customer service an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 

four key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core business of equipment rental the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network both in terms of composition and management responsible rate management and greater efficiency in all areas of operation as evidenced by a significant reduction in costs 

although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in 2010 we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy these achievements include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2011 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process the strengthening of our customer service capabilities and sustained cost controls additionally we will focus on 

 

  

  

  

 although there are nearterm challenges that may continue to constrain equipment rental demand we believe that our strategy together with our competitive advantages of size and a strong balance sheet puts us in a unique position to capitalize on opportunities that may arise during the recovery 

  

financial overview 

despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in 2009 and 2010 related to our capital structure and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions include 

 

  

  

  

 as discussed elsewhere in this report proceeds from these offerings as well as cash on hand were used to repurchase or redeem and subsequently retire certain of our outstanding debt securities these actions have improved our debt maturity profile and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery 

loss from continuing operations  loss from continuing operations and diluted loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

   

loss from continuing operations and diluted loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 include the impacts of the following special items amounts presented on an aftertax basis 

 

  

     in addition to the matters discussed above our 2010 performance reflects increased gross profit from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and reductions in selling general and administrative expenses as discussed below see “results of operations income taxes” our results for 2010 also include a tax benefit of 41 which equates to an effective tax rate of 651 percent 

ebitda gaap reconciliation  ebitda represents the sum of net loss loss from discontinued operation net of taxes benefit for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the restructuring charge the charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry the goodwill impairment charge and stock compensation expense net these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliation provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and 

  

provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net loss and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

 

  

   for the year ended december 31 2010 ebitda increased 60 or 102 percent and adjusted ebitda increased 63 or 100 percent primarily reflecting increased margins from sales of rental equipment and selling general and administrative expense reductions 

for the year ended december 31 2009 ebitda increased 706 primarily reflecting the absence of the 1147 noncash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment excluding the impact of the 2008 goodwill impairment charge the 2009 ebitda decline reflects lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment lower new and used equipment sales and reduced sales of contractor supplies consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business on an adjusted basis our ebitda declined 442 or 413 percent and our ebitda margin decreased by 62 percentage points to 266 percent also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business 

  

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2010 total revenues of 22 billion decreased 51 percent compared with total revenues of 24 billion in 2009 the decrease primarily reflects a 371 percent decline in sales of rental equipment and a 215 percent decline in contractor supplies sales equipment rental revenue increased slightly as a 43 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and the favorable impact of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars were largely offset by a 21 percent decrease in rental rates and other in 2011 based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and the broader economic environment we estimate that us nonresidential construction activity will increase in the midsingle digit percent range as compared to 2010 we expect to outperform the market in 2011 as improved rental rates and increased volume of oec on rent will each contribute to rental revenue growth the decline in sales of rental equipment in 2010 primarily reflects a decline in the volume of equipment sold the decline in contractor supplies sales in 2010 reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 

2009 total revenues of 24 billion decreased 278 percent compared with total revenues of 33 billion in 2008 the decrease primarily reflects a 267 percent decrease in equipment rental revenue a 520 percent decline in sales of new equipment a 429 percent decline in contractor supplies sales and a 133 percent decline in sales of rental equipment the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects an 118 percent decrease in rental rates and a 124 percent decrease in the volume of oec on rent the decline in sales of new equipment reflects volume declines the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold consistent with a weak construction environment partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products the decline in sales of rental equipment primarily reflects lower pricing due to general softness in the used equipment market and an increased proportion of used equipment sold through the auction channel partially offset by a higher number of units sold 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of 12 and 9 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are writtenoff when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes writeoffs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were 12 33 and 30 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 34 or 43 respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately 4 any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 6 or 8 respectively 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur 

  

that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized asset impairment charges of 9 12 and 8 respectively in our general rentals segment the 2010 impairment charge is primarily reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and principally relates to writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in connection with the consolidation of our branch network discussed below see “restructuring charge” the 2009 impairment charge includes 9 reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as well as 3 primarily related to leasehold improvement writeoffs which are reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations the 2008 impairment charge of 8 is reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and relates to certain rental equipment our estimates of the impairment charges for the rental fleet were calculated by comparing the proceeds estimated to be realized from the expected disposition of these rental assets to their carrying values the 2009 impairments of the rental fleet as well as the 2009 and 2010 writeoffs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets followed from our decision to close an aggregate of 113 branches in 2009 and 2010 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 there were 0 and 2 of held for sale assets reflected in rental equipment net in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold we select these assets which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december 31 2010 as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment as part of this impairment review we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed december 31 2010 quarterly review there was no impairment associated with these assets 

purchase price allocation  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition with the exception of goodwill longlived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions the longlived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment transportation equipment and real estate 

in addition to longlived fixed assets we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets however when appropriate we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill customer relationships and noncompete agreements goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed customer relationships and noncompete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  we have made acquisitions over the years principally during the period between 1997 and 2000 which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit accounting rules permit a company to carry forward a detailed determination of a reporting unit’s fair value from one year to the next if the following 

  

criteria are met i the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit have not changed significantly from the prior year ii the carrying amount of each reporting unit in the prior year significantly exceeded the fair value and iii the likelihood that the carrying value of each reporting unit this year would be less than the fair value is remote in 2010 because these criteria were met we carried forward the results of our 2009 fair value estimates 

in 2008 and 2009 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 

we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

 

  

  

 the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating the fair value of a reporting unit this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 and in connection with the preparation of our 2008 yearend financial statements we recognized an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment and included 10 billion reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october 1 2008 testing date as well as an additional 100 as of december 31 2008 reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter of 2008 substantially all of the impairment charge related to goodwill arising from acquisitions made between 1997 and 2000 

  

as of october 1 2010 we had 197 of goodwill on our balance sheet and of this amount substantially all related to our trench safety power and hvac reportable segment and three of our reporting units within the general rentals reportable segment southwest northwest and east our impairment testing indicated that the 2009 fair value estimates of the reporting units that were carried forward exceeded the carrying values thereby resulting in no indication of impairment the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below 

 

 the underlying analyses supporting our 2009 fair value assessment related to our outlook of the business’ longterm performance which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate in connection with our impairment testing in the prior year we utilized a discount rate of nine percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of two percent beyond our planning period we also performed sensitivity analyses on our assumptions and noted that increasing the discount rate by one percent still resulted in fair values in excess of the carrying values we also stress tested the longterm growth rate by reducing it to 15 percent noting that the fair values for all reporting units were still in excess of the carrying values we also stress tested the analysis to increase the discount rate to 10 percent and reduce the longterm growth rate to 15 percent as well as in several other combinations for reasonably possible scenarios noting that the carrying values were exceeded by the fair values 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies the most significant evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is reversal of temporary differences resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet we also evaluate projected taxable income over a period generally ranging from one to five years depending on the relevant tax jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and in addition examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused due to restrictive carrybackcarryover rules in various states that would limit realization of tax benefits and our history of certain state operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 

we have adopted an accounting principle which addresses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

  

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels as discussed below see “fourth quarter 2010 items” during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized a charge of 24 related to our provision for selfinsurance reserves the charge in particular reflects recent adverse experience in our portfolio of automobile and general liability claims as well as worker’s compensation claims 

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety power and hvac the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada the trench safety power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety power and hvac segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates throughout the united states and has two locations in canada 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our seven geographic regions—the southwest gulf northwest southeast midwest east and the northeast canada as well as the aerial west region into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2010 our midwest region’s equipment rentals gross margin varied by more than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals’ regions over the same period although the margin for the midwest region exceeded a 10 percent variance level for this five year period prior to the significant economic downturn in 2009 that negatively impacted all our regions the midwest region’s margin 

  

was converging with those achieved at the other general rentals’ regions and given management’s focus on cost cutting improved processes and fleet sharing we expect further convergence going forward although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

revenues by segment were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals 2010 equipment rentals of 183 billion was flat with 2009 as a 43 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and the favorable impact of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars “currency” were largely offset by a 21 percent decrease in rental rates and other equipment rentals represented 82 percent of total revenues in 2010 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 82 percent and 85 percent of total revenues for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased slightly as an increase in the volume of oec on rent and the favorable impact of currency were offset by a decrease in rental rates and other trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals increased 11 or 85 percent primarily reflecting a 102 percent increase in the volume of oec on rent partially offset by a 38 percent decrease in rental rates 

2009 equipment rentals of 183 billion decreased 666 or 267 percent primarily reflecting an 118 percent decrease in rental rates and a 124 percent decrease in the volume of oec on rent consistent with a weak construction environment equipment rentals represented 78 percent of total revenues in 2009 on a segment 

  

basis equipment rentals represented 77 percent and 83 percent of total revenue for general rentals and trench safety power and hvac respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased 626 or 269 percent primarily reflecting decreases in the volume of oec on rent and rental rates trench safety power and hvac equipment rentals decreased 40 or 235 percent primarily reflecting an 89 percent decrease in the volume of oec on rent and a 65 percent decrease in rental rates

sales of new equipment  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 sales of new equipment represented between 3 and 5 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales 2010 sales of new equipment of 78 declined 8 or 93 percent from 2009 reflecting volume declines 2009 sales of new equipment of 86 declined 93 or 520 percent from 2008 reflecting volume declines 

sales of contractor supplies  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 sales of contractor supplies represented between 4 and 6 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales 2010 sales of contractor supplies of 95 declined 26 or 215 percent from 2009 reflecting a reduction in the volume of supplies sold partially offset by improved pricing and product mix 2009 sales of contractor supplies of 121 declined 91 or 429 percent from 2008 reflecting a reduction in the volume of supplies sold consistent with a weak construction environment partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 

service and other revenues  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 service and other revenues represented approximately 4 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 97 percent of these sales 2010 service and other revenues of 86 decreased 6 or 65 percent from 2009 primarily reflecting reduced revenues from service labor and parts sales partially offset by increased software license and related revenues 2009 service and other revenues of 92 decreased 24 or 207 percent from 2008 primarily reflecting decreased revenues from service labor and parts sales

segment operating income  segment operating income and operating margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 the following is a reconciliation of segment operating income to total company operating income loss 

 

   

general rentals for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 general rentals accounted for between 85 and 91 percent of our total operating income excluding the unallocated items in the reconciliation above this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ operating income in 2010 increased 76 and operating margin increased 40 percentage points primarily reflecting increased gross margins from sales of rental equipment and selling general and administrative expense reductions general rentals’ operating margin in 2009 decreased 107 percentage points from 2008 primarily reflecting an 89 percentage point reduction in gross margin from equipment rentals and a 229 percentage point reduction in gross margin from sales of rental equipment partially offset by the benefits of costsavings initiatives 

trench safety power and hvac  for the year ended december 31 2010 operating income increased by 10 and operating margin increased by 52 percentage points from 2009 reflecting increased gross margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage operating income in 2009 decreased by 29 and operating margin decreased by 111 percentage points from 2008 reflecting reduced gross margins from equipment rentals 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows 

 

 2010 gross margin of 294 percent increased 35 percentage points as compared to 2009 primarily reflecting increased gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin increased 09 percentage points primarily reflecting a 49 percentage point increase in time utilization which is calculated by dividing the amount of time equipment is on rent by the amount of time we have owned the equipment a 28 reduction in depreciation due to a 32 percent decrease in average fleet size on an original equipment cost basis the impact of a 9 asset impairment charge related to certain rental equipment recognized in 2009 and savings realized from ongoing cost saving initiatives partially offset by a 21 percent rental rate decline and increases in certain variable costs including repairs and maintenance fuel and delivery associated with higher rental volume the 254 percentage point increase in gross margins from sales of rental equipment primarily reflects a higher proportion of retail sales which yield higher margins in 2010 in 2010 and 2009 on an original equipment costweighted basis retail sales represented 62 and 33 percent of our sales of rental equipment respectively while auction sales represented 22 and 40 percent of these sales respectively gross margins from sales of rental equipment may change in future periods if the mix of the channels that we use to sell rental equipment changes for instance in 2011 we anticipate selling a greater proportion of used equipment to manufacturers than we have in recent years equipment sales to manufacturers tend to have lower margins than sales through our retail network 

2009 gross margin of 259 percent declined 83 percentage points from 2008 primarily reflecting reduced gross margin from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin decreased 87 percentage points primarily reflecting an 118 percent decrease in rental rates and a 29 percentage point 

  

decrease in time utilization on a smaller fleet partially offset by savings realized from ongoing cost saving initiatives equipment rentals gross margin for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 includes impairment charges of 9 and 8 respectively related to the impairment of certain rental assets sales of rental equipment gross margin decreased 219 percentage points primarily reflecting deflationary pressures created by the current construction environment and a higher proportion of auctionrelated sales which tend to yield lower margins 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses  sga expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees advertising and marketing expenses management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 

2010 sga expense of 367 decreased 41 as compared to 2009 and improved by 09 percentage points as a percentage of revenue the decline in sga reflects the benefits we are realizing from our costsaving initiatives including reduced compensation costs professional fees and advertising expenses 

2009 sga expense of 408 declined 101 or 198 percent compared to 2008 and increased by 17 percentage points as a percentage of revenue the decline in the absolute level of our sga reflects the benefits we realized from our costsaving initiatives including reduced compensation travel and entertainment professional and advertising expenses the deterioration in our sga ratio reflected the combination of rental rate pressure and lower utilization levels in a weak construction environment 

restructuring charge for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 restructuring charges of 34 31 and 20 respectively relate to the closures of 49 64 and 75 branches respectively and reductions in headcount of approximately 700 1900 and 1000 respectively we expect that the restructuring activity will be substantially complete by the end of 2011 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional restructuring information 

charge related to settlement of sec inquiry  our results for the year ended december 31 2008 include a 14 charge related to the sec inquiry as previously announced in september 2008 we announced that we had reached a final settlement with the sec and we paid a civil penalty of 14 

goodwill impairment charge  as discussed above see “critical accounting policies—evaluation of goodwill impairment” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the impairment charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment 

nonrental depreciation and amortization for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

   

nonrental depreciation and amortization primarily includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as ii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as well as customerrelated intangible assets 

interest expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 29 or 13 percent interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 includes a loss of 28 and a gain of 7 respectively related to repurchases or redemptions of 1273 and 919 principal amounts of our outstanding debt respectively excluding the impact of these gainslosses interest expense net decreased slightly as the impact of lower average outstanding debt was partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 52 or 299 percent interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 includes gains of 7 and 41 respectively related to repurchases or redemptions of 919 and 255 principal amounts of our outstanding debt respectively excluding the impact of these gains interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased primarily due to increased debt following the preferred stock repurchase and the modified “dutch auction” tender offer completed in the second and third quarters of 2008 

interest expense—subordinated convertible debentures net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 as discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued quarterly income preferred securities “quips” this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was 124 interest expense subordinated convertible debentures net for 2009 included a 13 gain recognized in connection with the simultaneous purchase of 22 of quips and retirement of 22 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures 

other income net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 as discussed further in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements other income net for the year ended december 31 2010 includes i a gain of 13 associated with foreign currency forward contracts and ii a loss of 13 associated with the revaluation of certain canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans 

  

income taxes  the following table summarizes our continuing operations benefit for income taxes and the related effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 651 percent 439 percent and 134 percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items additionally the 2010 income tax benefit includes a benefit of 7 related to a correction of a deferred tax asset recognized in prior periods for 2010 and 2009 the difference also relates to the geographical mix of income between us and foreign and state operations additionally 2008 reflects the nondeductibility of a portion of the 11 billion goodwill impairment charge as well as the nondeductibility of the 14 charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 

the balance of prepaid expenses and other assets at december 31 2010 decreased by 52 or 584 percent as compared to december 31 2009 primarily due to a federal tax refund of 55 received in march 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital markets activity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

in october 2010 urna issued 750 aggregate principal amount of 8 3  8 percent senior subordinated notes which are due september 15 2020 we received 732 in net proceeds from the issuance of the 8 3  8 percent senior subordinated notes after underwriting discounts and commissions fees and expenses proceeds from this offering as well as cash on hand were used to repurchase or redeem and subsequently retire certain of our outstanding debt securities 

the following table summarizes our 2010 debt repurchase activity 

 

  

   

total debt at december 31 2010 decreased by 146 or 49 percent as compared to december 31 2009 primarily due to the use of free cash flow to pay down debt see above for a summary of 2010 capital market activity current maturities of longterm debt at december 31 2010 primarily reflect 221 of borrowings outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2010 we had i 617 of borrowing capacity net of 60 of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii 11 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of 203 cash equivalents at december 31 2010 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2010 683 and 221 were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility respectively the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december 31 2010 were 34 percent and 16 percent respectively during the year ended december 31 2010 the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility were 546 and 185 respectively and the weightedaverage interest rates thereon were 34 percent and 17 percent respectively the maximum monthend amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility during the year ended december 31 2010 were 683 and 240 respectively the amount outstanding at yearend under the abl facility exceeded the average amounts outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings used to settle a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

to access the capital markets we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions as a result negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding our credit ratings as of january 28 2010 were as follows 

 

  

 a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 

  

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in 2011 relative to 2010 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility the senior notes and the quips any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility both of these covenants were suspended on june 9 2009 because the availability as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility had exceeded 20 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility since the june 9 2009 suspension date and through december 31 2010 availability under the abl facility has exceeded 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and as a result these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 

as of december 31 2010 primarily due to losses sustained in prior years urna had no restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations due to certain intercompany arrangements 

sources and uses of cash  during 2010 we i generated cash from operations of 452 including 55 related to a federal tax refund and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 151 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 374 and ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of 183 during 2009 we i generated cash from operations of 438 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 242 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 311 ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of 206 and iii pay aggregate financing costs and costs associated with the convertible hedge transactions of 59 

  

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements net management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

 

 free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2010 was 227 a decrease of 140 as compared to free cash flow of 367 for the year ended december 31 2009 as noted above net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 includes a 55 federal tax refund excluding the impact of this refund the yearoveryear decrease in free cash flow primarily reflects increased purchases of rental equipment and reduced proceeds from sales of rental equipment in 2009 free cash flow increased 32 compared to 2008 this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in 2009 consistent with reduced construction activity in a challenging economic environment partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities and decreased proceeds from sales of rental equipment 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  as discussed above during 2010 we issued 750 aggregate principal amount of 8 3  8 percent senior subordinated notes and we repurchased or redeemed and subsequently retired certain of our outstanding debt securities as a result of this activity the total scheduled principal debt and capital lease payments decreased from 3033 at december 31 2009 to 2873 at december 31 2010 the total interest due on our debt increased from 1187 at december 31 2009 to 1427 at december 31 2010 primarily due to additional years of interest obligations associated with the newly issued 8 3  8 percent senior subordinated notes which mature in 2020 the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

  

   

      certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements  we lease real estate and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of some of our nonrental equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 8 under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees however we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated in accordance with gaap this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2010 or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2010 we had an aggregate of 904 of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of 683 of borrowings under the abl facility and 221 of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2010 were i 34 percent for the abl facility and ii 16 percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2010 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 5 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

at december 31 2010 we had an aggregate of 20 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates including our subordinated convertible debentures a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december 31 2010 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see notes 11 see “fair value of financial instruments” and 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2010 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual aftertax earnings to change by approximately 4 as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized foreign currency losses of 13 associated with the revaluation of certain canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans however these losses were offset by gains of 13 recognized on forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars and the aggregate foreign currency impact of the intercompany loans and forward contracts did not have a material impact on our earnings we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk  in connection with the november 2009 issuance of 173 aggregate principal amount of 4 percent convertible senior notes holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 155 million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2010 holders of the 4 percent convertible notes may convert the notes during the first quarter of 2011 at the initial conversion price of approximately 1111 per share of common stock as of january 28 2011 none of the 4 percent convertible notes were converted the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock at issuance however in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds 1556 per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was 2500 or 3000 per share on a net basis we would issue 59 million or 75 million shares respectively

 item 1 business tableend general 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of 569 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico we offer approximately 3000 classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and others in 2009 we generated total revenues of 24 billion including 18 billion of equipment rental revenue 

as of december 31 2009 our fleet of rental equipment included approximately 220000 units with a total original equipment cost “oec” based on initial consideration paid of 38 billion compared with 41 billion at december 31 2008 our fleet age which is calculated on a unitweighted basis was 424 months at december 31 2009 compared with 392 months at december 31 2008 the fleet includes 

 

  

  

  

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used equipment as well as related contractor supplies parts and service 

strategy 

for the past several years our strategy has focused on establishing a superior standard of customer service particularly with larger accounts while generating significant free cash flow and positioning the business to grow our earnings at higher margins three key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core rental business the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network both in terms of composition and management 

  

and greater efficiency with significant reductions in our operating costs although 2009 was challenging for both our company and the us equipment rental industry our 2009 achievements in pursuing this strategy included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2010 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core rental business strengthening our customer service capabilities implementing disciplined cost controls and generating free cash flow additionally we will focus on 

 

  

  

  

 although the depth and duration of the current economic downturn has been more pronounced than previous recessions we believe our strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of size disciplined purchasing power industry experience superior customer service capabilities and strong balance sheet has positioned us to navigate the economic downturn in a manner that will strengthen our leadership position in a recovery and improve our returns to stockholders 

industry overview 

we serve four principal endmarkets in the north american equipment rental industry commercial construction infrastructure industrial and residential based on an analysis of our charge customer’s standard industrial classification or sic codes and as measured by our 2009 total revenues commercial construction rentals for the construction and remodeling of office retail lodging and healthcare and other commercial facilities represent approximately 59 percent of our business infrastructure rentals related to the building of 

  

public structures such as bridges highways power plants and airports represent approximately 15 percent industrial rentals to manufacturers chemical companies paper mills railroads ship builders utilities and other industries represent approximately 18 percent and residential rentals for the construction and renovation of homes represents about 8 percent of our business 

given the relative significance of commercial construction to our overall revenues our business is particularly sensitive to changes in activity in this endmarket according to the national bureau of economic research a recession in the united states began in december 2007 and as a consequence private nonresidential commercial construction weakened throughout 2008 and 2009 the decline in our operating environment was exacerbated by the credit market crisis which began in late 2008 and the ongoing constraint this has placed on new project starts based on a consensus of leading national forecasts for nonresidential construction activity we expect commercial construction spending to decline further in 2010 albeit at a slower pace than in 2009 

although there are significant nearterm challenges that will suppress equipment rental demand through the first half of 2010 and perhaps beyond we believe that the longterm growth prospects for the equipment rental industry in north america are favorable beyond the dynamics of an economic recovery we believe that expansion will also be driven by the elevation of the industry’s profile in particular for the larger equipment rental companies which have the geographic footprint necessary to service large national accounts and endmarkets that increasingly appreciate the many benefits of renting equipment rather than owning it these benefits include 

 

  

  

  

 competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  we manage our rental fleet which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry utilizing a lifecycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels additionally as part of this lifecycle approach we closely monitor repairs and maintenance expense and can anticipate based on our extensive experience with this type of equipment the optimum time to dispose of an asset 

our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties of equipment in addition we believe our intense focus on serving national account and other large customers with a multiregional presence should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs revenues from national account customers were approximately 565 million and 675 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively and represented 

  

approximately 24 and 21 percent of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008 respectively with our continued focus on large national accounts for 2010 we expect this percentage to increase over time 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

 

  

  

 strong brand recognition  as the largest equipment rental company in the united states we have strong brand recognition which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty 

geographic and customer diversity  we have 569 rental locations in 48 states ten canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners we believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including 

 

  

  

 for additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

strong and motivated branch management  each of our fullservice branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them within budgetary guidelines to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters each regional office has a management team that monitors branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews 

employee training programs  we are dedicated to providing training and development opportunities to our employees in 2009 our employees enhanced their skills through over 325000 hours of training including equipmentrelated training from our suppliers and online courses covering a variety of subjects 

risk management and safety programs  our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals directing the procurement of insurance managing claims made against the company and developing loss prevention programs to address workplace safety driver safety and customer safety the department’s primary focus is on the protection of the employees assets and net income of the company and protecting the company from liability for accidental loss 

  

segment information 

we have two reportable segments–general rentals and trench safety pump and power segment financial information is presented in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment comprises seven geographic regions–the southwest gulf northwest southeast midwest east and the northeast canada–as well as the aerial west region and operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico the trench safety pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety pump and power segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 

products and services 

our principal products and services are described below 

equipment rental  we offer for rent approximately 3000 classes of rental equipment on an hourly daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms trench safety equipment and general tools and light equipment the unitweighted age of our fleet was 424 months at december 31 2009 compared to 392 months at december 31 2008 although we expect to age our fleet in 2010 we believe this decision is appropriate given our expectations for reduced construction activity through the first half of 2010 and perhaps beyond additionally aging the fleet will allow us to generate greater cash flows than we otherwise would 

sales of rental equipment  we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the age composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the market for used equipment the age of the fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements as well as local demand 

we utilize many channels to sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america at auction through brokers and directly to manufacturers we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale in addition we hold united rentals certified auctions on ebay to provide customers with another convenient online tool for purchasing used equipment 

new equipment sales  we sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers the manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include genie jlg and skyjack aerial lifts multiquip wacker and honda usa compaction equipment generators and pumps sullair compressors skytrak and lull rough terrain reach forklifts takeuchi skidsteer loaders terex telehandlers and dewalt generators the type of new equipment that we sell varies by location

service and other revenues  we also offer repair maintenance and rental protection services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers our target customers for these types of ancillary services are our current rental customers as well as those who purchase both new and used equipment from our branches 

  

rentalman r and infomanager r software  we have two subsidiaries that develop and market software one of the subsidiaries develops and markets rentalman r  which is an enterprise resource planning application used by ourselves and most of the other largest equipment rental companies the other subsidiary develops and markets infomanager r  which provides a complete solution for creating an advanced business intelligence system infomanager r  helps with extracting raw data from transactional applications transforming it into meaningful information and saving it in a database that is specifically optimized for analytical use 

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners in 2009 our largest customer accounted for less than one percent of our revenues and our top ten customers accounted for less than three percent of our revenues historically over 90 percent of our business each year as measured by revenues has been generated from previous customers 

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy including construction opportunities with different customers our customers include 

 

  

  

  

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  we have approximately 1900 sales people including approximately 1000 outside sales representatives who frequently travel to customer jobsites and meet with customers and approximately 900 inside sales people who work in our branches and at our national call center our sales people are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team which consists of approximately 65 sales professionals and includes those who service governmental agencies closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area 

erentals  our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our erentals portal which can be found at httpwwwurcom our customers can also use our ur data ® application to access realtime reports on their business activity with us 

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

  

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history and financial strength we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 25 percent of our 2009 purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 65 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our ibm system i™ system located at our data center rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day 

these systems 

 

  

  

 our information technology systems and website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists working in conjunction with our strategic technology partners and service providers this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy in 2009 we made the following investments in the area of technology 

 

  

  

   

  

 each of these investments is aligned with our strategic focus on customer service and operational efficiencies 

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate nine percent market share and that the four largest companies account for approximately 26 percent of industry revenue based on 2008 revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the american rental association “ara” our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand although these considerations benefit us in many ways the fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure especially in a distressed economic environment like we are currently experiencing 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

in connection with our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and in anticipation of the challenging economic environment we significantly reduced our employee headcount from approximately 10900 at january 1 2008 to approximately 9900 at january 1 2009 and approximately 8000 at january 1 2010 of these approximately 2700 are salaried personnel and approximately 5300 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 57 separate locations cover approximately 600 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

the current economic downturn and resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities has adversely affected our revenues and operating results and may further decrease the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge 

our rental equipment is used primarily in the nonresidential construction industry which is cyclical in nature trench safety pump and power equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities weakness in our end markets such as the decline in construction and industrial activity our industry has been experiencing as a result of the current economic environment has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge and will likely lead to further decreases such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced 

the following factors among others may cause further weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 

  

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past year in many cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our or our competitors’ operating performance 

  

our substantial debt exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2009 our total indebtedness was approximately 31 billion including 124 million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 

  

  

  

  

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 

  

  

  

  

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2009 we had 530 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represents 17 percent of our total indebtedness including our subordinated convertible debentures see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

despite our current indebtedness levels we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

despite our current indebtedness levels we may be able to incur substantially more additional indebtedness in the future we will not be fully restricted under the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness any of which actions could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

  

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” we are required among other things to satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda both of these covenants were suspended on june 9 2009 because the availability as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility had exceeded 20 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility since the june 9 2009 suspension date and through december 31 2009 availability under the abl facility has exceeded 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and as a result these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding if we are unable to satisfy any of the relevant covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor other agreements governing our debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations 

in addition to financial covenants we are subject to various other covenants in the abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility and in the other agreements governing our debt in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations for instance these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur additional indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends repurchase common stock make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt and the depth and duration of the current economic downturn in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

we have a holding company structure and we will depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to pay amounts due on our indebtedness certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries 

we derive substantially all of our operating income from and hold substantially all of our assets through our subsidiaries the effect of this structure is that we will depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and 

  

the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings in order to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt provisions of law such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us furthermore these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions 

we are subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

multiple purported class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against the company as described in greater detail under item 3—legal proceedings these include three complaints that were filed following our november 14 2007 announcement that affiliates of cerberus capital management lp “cerberus” had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement entered into with such persons these complaints have been consolidated the second consolidated amended complaint in this action alleges among other things that certain of the company’s filings with the sec including proxy materials in connection with the special meeting of stockholders and other public statements contained false and misleading statements andor material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with affiliates of cerberus each action asserts claims under sections 10b and 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” and sec rules 10b5 and 14a9 thereunder and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the second consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages costs expenses and fees on august 24 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the second consolidated amended complaint with prejudice and entered a judgment in favor of defendants on september 22 2009 lead plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment dismissing the consolidated actions we can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings or any other stockholder lawsuit pending against the company and if we do not prevail we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts further regardless of the outcome we may incur significant defense and indemnification costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs damages or settlement amounts such payments to the extent not covered advanced or timely reimbursed by insurance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

as previously reported in may 2009 we settled certain purported class action lawsuits that were filed following our august 2004 announcement of an sec inquiry into the company’s historical accounting practices and the litigation was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a stipulation of settlement we received a letter from counsel for an alleged stockholder which demands among other things that we investigate the agreement of our board of directors to settle this action while upon the recommendation of a new committee of independent directors our board determined that it would not be in the best interests of the company to take further action at this time we cannot predict whether the relevant stockholder will pursue this matter further 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims further as described elsewhere in this report several stockholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 

   

  

  

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves that cause us to significantly increase such reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in addition the purported class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with such matters may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions or consolidations that we may make in the future 

we have historically achieved a substantial portion of our growth through acquisitions although we have not made many acquisitions in recent years we are always open to considering potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to enhance our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

  

our rights plan and charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

we have in place a stockholders’ rights plan and certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices as previously reported on october 16 2008 we amended our rights plan to reduce the beneficial ownership threshold required to trigger rights under the plan from a 25 percent ownership interest to a 15 percent ownership interest we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under the abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world generally for top management talent is significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover given the volatility in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we are pursuing a strategy of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account customers and from other large customers we are also continuing to pursue an earlierstarted overall cost reduction program which achieved substantial cost savings in 2009 the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2010 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that will adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and more recently nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of 

  

key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to the company or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things further decreasing our rental volumes further depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental 

  

compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our over 480 branch locations in the united states are located in 48 different states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 600 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 7400 employees who are not represented by unions various unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility in addition proposed federal legislation would make it easier for unions to organize by requiring employers to recognize unions based on card check authorization rather than by secret ballot election and would impose arbitration to settle firsttime collective bargaining agreements if the parties have not reached agreement within 120 days of recognition the enactment of such legislation could significantly increase labor costs in ways that are difficult to predict 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another branch although we have used and may continue to use futures contracts to hedge against rising andor declining fuel prices a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if our maintenance and equipment replacement costs increase as our rental fleet ages and we are unable to pass along such costs our earnings will decrease 

as we age our fleet of rental equipment which we expect to do in 2010 the cost of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time may increase any increases in such costs will cause our earnings to decrease in addition the cost of the new equipment we use in our rental fleet may increase and therefore we may spend more for replacement equipment any such cost increases are due primarily to increased material costs including increases in the cost of steel which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use and increases in the cost of fuel which is used in the manufacturing process and in delivering equipment to us any such cost increases could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions and iii the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated tableend executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 569 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 

we offer approximately 3000 classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners government entities and others our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of used rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other in 2009 equipment rental revenues represented 78 percent of our total revenues 

as expected and consistent with the recent decline in nonresidential construction activity 2009 was challenging for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in particular and as discussed elsewhere in this report because of this environment we have experienced deterioration in the prices we charge our customers “rental rates” the utilization of our equipment and the gross margins we realize from the sale of used equipment as a consequence our revenues and profitability have deteriorated in anticipation of these challenges however we have developed and executed a strategy that we believe has positioned us to weather the economic downturn and will enable us to improve our returns to stockholders once economic conditions improve 

for the past several years our strategy has focused on establishing a superior standard of customer service particularly with larger accounts while generating significant free cash flow and positioning the business to grow our earnings at higher margins three key elements of this strategy are a consistent focus on our core rental business the optimization of our rental fleet and branch network both in terms of composition and management and greater efficiency with significant reductions in our operating costs although 2009 was challenging for both our company and the us equipment rental industry our 2009 achievements in pursuing this strategy included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in 2010 we will continue to focus on optimizing our core rental business strengthening our customer service capabilities implementing disciplined cost controls and generating free cash flow additionally we will focus on 

 

  

  

  

 although the depth and duration of the current economic downturn has been more pronounced than previous recessions we believe our strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of size disciplined purchasing power industry experience superior customer service capabilities and strong balance sheet has positioned us to navigate the economic downturn in a manner that will strengthen our leadership position in a recovery and improve our returns to stockholders 

as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and we have not accrued any amounts related to their ultimate disposition any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred other costs associated with the sec inquiry the us attorney’s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits including reimbursement of attorneys’ fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors are expensed as incurred 

financial overview 

despite the challenges posed by an extremely weak economy and the credit market crisis we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in 2009 related to our capital structure and have substantively improved our financial flexibility and liquidity these actions include 

 

  

  

 as discussed elsewhere in this report proceeds from these offerings as well as cash on hand were used to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 as well as our remaining 14 percent senior notes due 2014 these actions have improved our debt maturity profile and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantages of opportunities in an economic recovery 

  

loss income from continuing operations  loss income from continuing operations and diluted loss earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 loss income from continuing operations and diluted loss earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 include the impacts of the following special items amounts presented on an aftertax basis 

 

  

       

  in addition to the matters discussed above our 2009 performance reflects lower gross profit from equipment rental revenues and from the sale of rental equipment in a very challenging construction environment partially offset by savings realized from our ongoing initiatives to reduce operating costs 

ebitda gaap reconciliation  ebitda represents the sum of net loss income loss from discontinued operation net of taxes benefit provision for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net depreciation of rental equipment and nonrental depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus i the sum of the restructuring charge the charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry the goodwill impairment charge and stock compensation expense net less ii the sum of the merger termination benefit and the foreign currency transaction gain these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time as well as with those of other similar companies management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda when viewed with the company’s results under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the accompanying reconciliation provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net income loss and ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

 

  

    

    for the year ended december 31 2009 ebitda increased 706 primarily reflecting the absence of the 1147 noncash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment excluding the impact of the 2008 goodwill impairment charge the 2009 ebitda decline reflects lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment lower new and used equipment sales and reduced sales of contractor supplies consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business on an adjusted basis our ebitda declined 442 or 413 percent and our ebitda margin decreased by 62 percentage points to 266 percent also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business 

for the year ended december 31 2008 ebitda decreased 1382 primarily due to the 1147 noncash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment and the absence of the 91 merger termination benefit that enhanced our 2007 results the ebitda decline also reflects lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment reduced sales of contractor supplies consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business and lower new and used equipment sales on an adjusted basis our ebitda declined 102 or 87 percent also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business we were able to partially offset the impact of these factors with savings realized from our ongoing initiatives to reduce operating costs and as a result improved our adjusted ebitda margin by 13 percentage points to 328 percent 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2009 total revenues of 24 billion decreased 278 percent compared with total revenues of 33 billion in 2008 the decrease primarily reflects a 267 percent decrease in equipment rental revenue a 520 percent decline in new equipment sales a 429 percent decline in contractor supplies sales and a 133 percent decline in used 

  

equipment sales the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects an 118 percent decrease in rental rates and a 29 percentage point decrease in time utilization on a smaller fleet the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold consistent with a weak construction environment partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects lower pricing due to general softness in the used equipment market and an increased proportion of used equipment sold through the auction channel partially offset by a higher number of units sold in 2010 based on our analysis of industry forecasts and with consideration given to the broader economic and credit environment we expect our total revenues to decline further albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in 2009 

2008 total revenues of 33 billion decreased 121 percent compared with total revenues of 37 billion in 2007 the decrease primarily reflects a 59 percent decrease in equipment rental revenue a 439 percent decline in contractor supplies sales a 172 percent decline in used equipment sales and a 222 percent decline in new equipment sales the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects a 31 percent decline in rental rates and a 04 percentage point decrease in time utilization the decline in contractor supplies sales reflects the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business as a complementary offering to our core rental business the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects volume declines as we focus on selling older assets in line with our lifecycle management strategy the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates andor judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date in any given accounting period we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date for instance continuing the above example if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december 29 and returned it at the close of business on january 1 we would recognize incremental revenue on january 1 of 17144 in actual dollars representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straightline basis we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet we had deferred revenue of 9 and 11 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff 

  

experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 10 percent of cost costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related equipment the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were 33 30 and 13 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness in addition the salvage value which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 34 or 43 respectively similarly to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately 4 any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year we estimate that our annual nonrental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately 6 or 8 respectively 

impairment of longlived assets we review the recoverability of our longlived assets including rental equipment and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we recognized asset impairment charges of 12 8 and 0 respectively in our general rentals segment the 2009 impairment charge includes 9 reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as well as 3 primarily related to leasehold improvement writeoffs which are reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations the 2008 impairment charge of 8 is reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and relates to certain rental equipment our estimates of the impairment charges for the rental fleet were calculated by comparing the proceeds estimated to be realized from the expected disposition of these rental assets to their carrying values the 2009 impairment of the rental fleet as well as the leasehold improvement writeoffs followed from our decision to close 64 branches in 2009 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 there were 2 and 8 of held for sale assets reflected in rental equipment net in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets that have both time and dollar utilization below a specified threshold we select these assets which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december 31 2009 as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment as part of this impairment review we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization 

  

levels the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives additionally we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition based on our most recently completed december 31 2009 quarterly review there was no impairment associated with these assets 

purchase price allocation  we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition with the exception of goodwill longlived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions the longlived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment transportation equipment and real estate 

in addition to longlived fixed assets we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets however when appropriate we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill customer relationships and covenants nottocompete goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed customer relationships and noncompete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  we have made numerous acquisitions over the years principally during the period between 1997 and 2000 which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in 2008 and 2009 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses we believe this approach which utilizes multiple valuation techniques yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 

we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

 

   

  

  

 the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 and in connection with the preparation of our 2008 yearend financial statements we recognized an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment and includes 10 billion reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october 1 2008 testing date as well as an additional 100 as of december 31 2008 reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter of 2008 substantially all of the impairment charge related to goodwill arising from acquisitions made between 1997 and 2000 

as of our october 1 2009 testing date we had 196 of goodwill on our balance sheet and of this amount substantially all related to our trench safety pump and power reportable segment and three of our reporting units within the general rentals reportable segment southwest northwest and east our october 1 2009 impairment testing indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values thereby resulting in no indication of impairment the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below 

 

 the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment related to our outlook of the business’ longterm performance which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate in connection with our october 1 2009 impairment test we utilized a discount rate of nine percent and a longterm terminal growth rate of two percent beyond our planning period 

we also performed sensitivity analyses on our assumptions and noted that increasing the discount rate by one percent still resulted in fair values in excess of the carrying values we also stress tested the longterm growth rate by reducing it to 15 percent noting that the fair values for all reporting units were still in excess of the carrying values we also stress tested the analysis to increase the discount rate to 10 percent and reduce the longterm growth rate to 15 percent as well as in several other combinations for reasonably possible scenarios noting that the carrying values were exceeded by the fair values 

  

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies the most significant evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is reversal of temporary differences resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet we also evaluate projected taxable income over a period generally ranging from one to five years depending on the relevant tax jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and in addition examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused due to restrictive carrybackcarryover rules in various states that would limit realization of tax benefits and our history of certain state operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted an accounting principle which addresses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling 

  

our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety pump and power the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico the trench safety pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety pump and power segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we aggregate our seven geographic regions—the southwest gulf northwest southeast midwest east and the northeast canada as well as the aerial west region into our general rentals reporting segment historically there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions for instance for the five year period ended december 31 2009 our midwest region’s equipment rentals gross margin varied by more than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals’ regions over the same period although the margin for the midwest region exceeded a 10 percent variance level for this five year period prior to the significant economic downturn in 2009 that negatively impacted all our regions the midwest region’s margin was converging with those achieved at the other general rentals’ regions and given management’s focus on cost cutting improved processes and fleet sharing we expect further convergence going forward although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results our revenues operating results and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 

  

revenues by segment were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals 2009 equipment rentals of 183 billion decreased 666 or 267 percent reflecting an 118 percent decline in rental rates and a 29 percentage point decrease in time utilization consistent with a weak construction environment dollar utilization which reflects the impact of both rental rates and time utilization and is calculated based on annualized rental revenue divided by the average original equipment cost of our fleet decreased 114 percentage points to 455 percent equipment rentals represented 78 percent of total revenues in 2009 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 77 percent and 83 percent of total revenue for general rentals and trench safety pump and power respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased 626 or 269 percent reflecting a 233 percent decrease in samestore rental revenues trench safety pump and power equipment rentals decreased 40 or 235 percent reflecting a 214 percent decrease in samestore rental revenues 

2008 equipment rentals of 250 billion decreased 156 or 59 percent reflecting a 31 percent decline in rental rates and a 04 percentage point decrease in time utilization dollar utilization which reflects the impact of both rental rates and time utilization and is calculated based on annualized rental revenue divided by the average original equipment cost of our fleet decreased 49 percentage points to 569 percent equipment rentals represented 76 percent of total revenues in 2008 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 76 percent and 84 percent of total revenue for general rentals and trench safety pump and power respectively general rentals equipment rentals decreased 150 or 61 percent reflecting a 56 percent decrease in samestore rental revenues trench safety pump and power equipment rentals decreased 6 or 34 percent reflecting a 30 percent decrease in samestore rental revenues 

sales of rental equipment  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 sales of rental equipment represented between 8 and 10 percent of our total revenues our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales 2009 sales of rental equipment of 229 declined 35 or 133 percent 

  

from 2008 reflecting lower pricing due to general softness in the used equipment market and an increased proportion of used equipment sold through the auction channel partially offset by a higher number of units sold in 2009 the average age of our used equipment sold was 78 months as compared to 79 months in 2008 2008 sales of rental equipment of 264 declined 55 or 172 percent from 2007 reflecting volume declines as we focus on selling older assets in line with our lifecycle management strategy 

sales of new equipment  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 sales of new equipment represented between 4 and 6 percent of our total revenue our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales 2009 sales of new equipment of 86 declined 93 or 520 percent from 2008 reflecting volume declines 2008 sales of new equipment of 179 declined 51 or 222 percent from 2007 reflecting volume declines 

sales of contractor supplies  for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 sales of contractor supplies represented between 5 and 6 percent of our total revenue compared to approximately 10 percent for the year ended december 31 2007 our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales 2009 sales of contractor supplies of 121 declined 91 or 429 percent from 2008 reflecting a reduction in the volume of supplies sold consistent with a weak construction environment partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 2008 sales of contractor supplies of 212 declined 166 or 439 percent from 2007 reflecting the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business as a complementary offering to our core rental business 

service and other revenues  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 service and other revenues represented approximately 4 percent of our total revenue our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 97 percent of these sales 2009 service and other revenues of 92 decreased 24 or 207 percent from 2008 primarily reflecting decreased revenues from service labor and parts sales 2008 service and other revenues of 116 decreased 20 or 147 percent from 2007 primarily reflecting decreased revenues from service labor and software sales 

fourth quarter 2009 items in the fourth quarter of 2009 we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 429 principal amount of our outstanding 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 and 14 percent senior notes due 2014 interest expense net for the fourth quarter of 2009 includes a pretax loss of 9 representing the difference between the net carrying amount of these securities and the total purchase price of 430 additionally during the quarter we recognized restructuring charges of 6 related to the closure of 13 branches and reductions in headcount of approximately 400 during the quarter we also recognized asset impairment charges of 3 these asset impairment charges include 2 reflected in depreciation of rental equipment and 1 primarily related to leasehold improvement writeoffs which are reflected in nonrental depreciation and amortization during the quarter we also recognized a charge of 8 reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for selfinsurance reserves comprised of 4 recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation and 4 recorded in discontinued operation additionally during the quarter we recognized a benefit of 3 primarily relating to vacation forfeitures comprised of 2 recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation and 1 recorded in selling general and administrative expenses 

fourth quarter 2008 items  in addition to the noncash goodwill impairment charge discussed above in the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 130 principal amount of our outstanding 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 7 3  4 percent senior subordinated notes due 2013 and 7 percent senior subordinated notes due 2014 interest expense net for the fourth quarter of 2008 includes a pretax gain of 45 representing the difference between the net carrying amount of these securities and the total purchase price of 82 additionally during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized restructuring charges of 14 related to the closure of 44 branches and reductions in headcount of approximately 500 during the quarter we also recognized a noncash impairment charge of 8 within depreciation of rental equipment related to certain rental assets during the fourth quarter of 2008 we also reduced our reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage by 3 following our annual physical inventory inspections this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding 

  

depreciation also during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized a benefit of 5 reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for selfinsurance reserves this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation 

fourth quarter 2007 items  during the fourth quarter of 2007 we reduced our reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage by 4 following our annual physical inventory inspections this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation also during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recognized a benefit of 3 reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for selfinsurance reserves this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation in addition to these matters during the fourth quarter we recognized a pretax gain of 94 related to the termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus as well as net foreign currency transaction gains of 17 pretax both of these matters are discussed further below see other income expense net 

segment operating income  segment operating income and operating margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 the following is a reconciliation of segment operating income to total company operating loss income 

 

 general rentals for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 general rentals accounted for between 85 and 92 percent of our total operating income excluding the unallocated items in the reconciliation above this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ operating margin in 2009 decreased 107 percentage points from 2008 primarily reflecting an 89 percentage point reduction in gross margin from equipment rentals and a 229 percentage point reduction in gross margin from sales of rental equipment partially offset by the benefits of costsavings initiatives general rentals’ operating margin in 2008 decreased 10 percentage points from 2007 primarily reflecting a 29 percentage point reduction in gross margin from equipment rentals partially offset by the favorable impact of a shift in revenue mix resulting from our focus on higher margin equipment rentals and the benefits of costsavings initiatives 

trench safety pump and power  for the year ended december 31 2009 operating income decreased by 29 and operating margin decreased by 111 percentage points from 2008 reflecting reduced gross margins from 

  

equipment rentals operating income in 2008 decreased by 4 and operating margin increased by 05 percentage points from 2007 reflecting reduced gross margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage 

gross margin  gross margins by revenue classification were as follows 

 

 2009 gross margin of 259 percent declined 83 percentage points from 2008 primarily reflecting reduced gross margin from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment equipment rentals gross margin decreased 87 percentage points primarily reflecting an 118 percent decrease in rental rates and a 29 percentage point decrease in time utilization on a smaller fleet partially offset by savings realized from ongoing cost saving initiatives equipment rentals gross margin for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 includes impairment charges of 9 and 8 respectively related to the impairment of certain rental assets sales of rental equipment gross margin decreased 219 percentage points primarily reflecting deflationary pressures created by the current construction environment and a higher proportion of auctionrelated sales which tend to yield lower margins 

2008 gross margin of 342 percent declined 11 percentage points from 2007 primarily reflecting a 28 percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals partially offset by a 46 percentage point improvement in gross margin on contractor supplies sales the decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects a 31 percent decline in rental rates partially offset by savings realized from our ongoing cost savings initiatives additionally equipment rentals gross margin was adversely impacted by a charge of 8 related to the impairment of certain rental assets the increase in contractor supplies gross margin is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business by focusing on higher margin products and reducing the number of our distribution centers from nine to two 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses  sga expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 was as follows 

 

 sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees advertising and marketing expenses management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 

2009 sga expense of 408 declined 101 or 198 percent compared to 2008 and increased by 17 percentage points as a percentage of revenue the decline in the absolute level of our sga reflects the benefits we are realizing from our costsaving initiatives including reduced compensation travel and entertainment professional and advertising expenses the deterioration in our sga ratio reflects the combination of rental rate pressure and lower utilization levels in a weak construction environment 

  

2008 sga expense of 509 declined 89 or 149 percent compared to 2007 and declined by 05 percentage points as a percentage of revenue this decline reflects the benefits we realized from our cost saving initiatives including reduced compensation costs and travel expenses partially offset by normal inflationary increases and a 7 increase in bad debt expense the increase in bad debt expense reflects a deterioration in 2008 in accounts receivable collection experience and writeoff trends 

restructuring charge for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 restructuring charges of 31 and 20 respectively relate to the closures of 64 and 75 branches respectively and reductions in headcount of approximately 1900 and 1000 respectively see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional restructuring information 

charge related to settlement of sec inquiry  our results for the year ended december 31 2008 include a 14 charge related to the sec inquiry recognized in the second quarter of 2008 as previously announced in september 2008 we announced that we had reached a final settlement with the sec and we paid a civil penalty of 14 

goodwill impairment charge  as discussed above see “critical accounting policies—evaluation of goodwill impairment” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the impairment charge reflected the challenges of the construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment 

nonrental depreciation and amortization for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 was as follows 

 

 nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as ii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as well as customerrelated intangible assets 

interest expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 was as follows 

 

 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 52 or 299 percent interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 includes gains of 7 and 41 respectively related to repurchases of 919 and 255 principal amounts of our outstanding debt respectively excluding the impact of these gains interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased primarily due to increased debt following the preferred stock repurchase and the modified “dutch auction” tender offer completed in the second and third quarters of 2008 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 13 or 70 percent compared to 2007 primarily due to the 41 gain related to repurchases of outstanding debt noted above excluding the impact of this gain interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2008 increased primarily due to increased debt following the preferred stock repurchase and the modified “dutch auction” tender offer completed in the second and third quarters of 2008 

  

interest expense—subordinated convertible debentures net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 was as follows 

 

 as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued quarterly income preferred securities “quips” this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was 124 and 146 respectively the decline in interest expense subordinated convertible debentures net from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects a 13 gain we recognized in 2009 in connection with the simultaneous purchase of 22 of quips and retirement of 22 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures 

other income expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 was as follows 

 

 in april 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the commencement of a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value including a possible sale of the company in july 2007 we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to be acquired by affiliates of cerberus in december 2007 following the termination of that merger agreement we received a breakup fee of 100 other income for 2007 includes the income associated with the receipt of the breakup fee net of related transaction costs of 9 other income for 2007 also includes 17 of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar and our us subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a longterm investment nature exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change prior to 2007 we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity rather than including them in income our results for 2007 include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter of the 17 recognized in 2007 13 relates to 2007 exchange rate movements and 4 relates to prior periods this correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its effect on our prior years’ net income cash flows from operations and stockholders’ equity is not material 

income taxes  the following table summarizes our continuing operations benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

   

the differences between the effective tax rates of 439 percent 134 percent and 372 percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items additionally in 2009 the difference relates to the geographical mix of income between us and foreign and state operations additionally 2008 reflects the nondeductibility of a portion of the 11 billion goodwill impairment charge as well as the nondeductibility of the 14 charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry and 2007 includes a benefit associated with the release of state tax valuation allowances partially offset by certain nondeductible compensation expense and prior year state tax matters our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 

recent accounting pronouncements  see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital markets activity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

in june 2009 urna issued 500 aggregate principal amount of 10 7  8 percent senior notes which are due june 15 2016 we received 471 in net proceeds from the issuance of the 10 7  8 percent senior notes after underwriting discounts and commissions fees and expenses 

in november 2009 urna issued 500 aggregate principal amount of 9 1  4 percent senior notes which are due december 15 2019 we received 480 in net proceeds from the issuance of the 9 1  4 percent senior notes after underwriting discounts and commissions fees and expenses 

in november 2009 uri issued 173 aggregate principal amount of 4 percent convertible senior notes which are due november 15 2015 we received 167 in net proceeds from the issuance of the 4 percent convertible senior notes after commissions fees and expenses but before the 26 cost of the convertible note hedge transactions in connection with the 4 percent convertible senior notes offering uri entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible senior notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately 1556 per share from the initial conversion price of approximately 1111 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock on november 10 2009 however in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds 1556 per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution 

  

proceeds from these offerings as well as cash on hand were used to repurchase and retire certain of our outstanding debt securities the following table summarizes our 2009 debt repurchase activity 

 

  

 in addition to the above debt repurchases during the year ended december 31 2009 we purchased an aggregate of 22 of quips for 9 in connection with this transaction we retired 22 principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures and recognized a gain of 13 this gain is reflected in interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures net in our consolidated statements of operations 

in january 2010 we announced that we will redeem the remaining 435 aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 at par in february 2010 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2009 we had i 954 of borrowing capacity net of 69 of letters of credit available under the abl facility ii 19 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of 169 cash equivalents at december 31 2009 consist of direct obligations of aa rated financial institutions we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility we estimate that our net rental capital expenditures which we define as purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment will be between 100 and 120 in 2010 as compared to 31 in 2009 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility the accounts receivable securitization facility the senior notes and the 

  

quips any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

the only financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility both of these covenants were suspended on june 9 2009 because the availability as defined in the agreement governing the abl facility had exceeded 20 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility since the june 9 2009 suspension date and through december 31 2009 availability under the abl facility has exceeded 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility and as a result these maintenance covenants remained inapplicable subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility 

as of december 31 2009 primarily due to our 2008 goodwill impairment charge urna no longer had any restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness although this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations due to certain intercompany arrangements 

sources and uses of cash—continuing operations  during 2009 we i generated cash from operations of 438 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 242 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 311 ii fund payments net of proceeds on debt of 206 and iii pay aggregate financing costs and costs associated with the convertible hedge transactions of 59 during 2008 we i generated cash from operations of 764 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 275 and iii received proceeds net of payments on debt of 279 principally related to the abl facility we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 704 ii repurchase common stock of 603 and iii redeem our preferred stock of 257 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities—continuing operations less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

 

 in 2009 we generated free cash flow of 367 compared to 335 in 2008 this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in 2009 consistent with our expectation for reduced construction activity and a challenging 

  

economic environment partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities and decreased proceeds from sales of rental equipment in 2008 free cash flow increased 93 compared to 2007 excluding the impact of the merger termination benefit which increased 2007 free cash flow by 91 2008 free cash flow increased 184 compared to 2007 primarily reflecting lower capital expenditures in a challenging economic environment partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment 

our credit ratings as of february 1 2010 were as follows 

 

  

 both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the noninvestment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities insofar as such ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

   

      certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements  we lease real estate and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of some of our nonrental equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 17 under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees however we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated in accordance with gaap this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2009 or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 

interest rate risk  as of december 31 2009 we had an aggregate of 530 of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates comprised of 337 of borrowings under the abl facility and 193 of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2009 were i 33 percent for the abl facility and ii 16 percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2009 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 3 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

  

the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2009 we had an aggregate of 25 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates including our subordinated convertible debentures a one percentage point change in market interest rates as of december 31 2009 would change the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately four percent for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt see notes 2 see “fair value of financial instruments” and 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2009 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2009 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

equity price risk  in connection with the november 2009 issuance of 173 aggregate principal amount of 4 percent convertible senior notes holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments 155 million shares of our common stock the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce subject to a limit the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the 4 percent convertible notes the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to approximately 1556 per share equal to an approximately 75 percent premium over the 889 closing price of our common stock on november 10 2009 however in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds 1556 per share the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution for example if at the time of exercise of the conversion right the price of our common stock was 1700 or 2000 per share on a net basis we would issue 13 million or 34 million shares respectively

 item 1 business tableend general 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of 628 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico we offer for rent over 2800 classes of rental equipment including heavy machines and hand tools to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and others in 2008 we generated revenue of 33 billion including 25 billion of equipment rental revenue 

as of december 31 2008 our fleet of rental equipment included over 245000 units having an original equipment cost “oec” based on initial consideration paid of 41 billion compared to 42 billion at december 31 2007 the fleet includes 

 

  

  

  

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used rental equipment as well as related contractor supplies parts and service 

strategy 

in 2008 our strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins while also continuing to generate significant cash flow three key elements of this strategy were refocusing our employees and sales 

  

representatives on our core rental business optimizing the management of our rental fleet and reducing our operating costs our 2008 achievements in pursuing this strategy included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2009 we will continue to focus on our core rental business optimizing fleet management disciplined cost management and free cash generation additionally we will focus on optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness and increasing the proportion of our revenues which come from national account and other large customers to the extent we are successful at increasing the proportion of our revenue derived from these customers we believe that over the longterm we can improve our equipment rental gross margins and overall profitability as these accounts tend to have higher utilization and can be serviced more cost effectively in 2009 we also intend to actively pursue growth in industrial rentals where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage moreover industrial rentals are subject to different cyclical pressures than the commercial construction market where we are seeing demand continue to soften as spending is curtailed 

although we expect 2009 to be a challenging year for both our company and the us equipment rental industry generally we believe our strategy coupled with our broad geographic footprint extensive rental fleet advanced information technology systems disciplined purchasing power industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service will position us to weather the economic downturn and enable us to strengthen our leadership position and improve our returns to stockholders once economic conditions improve 

industry overview 

we serve four principal endmarkets in the us equipment rental industry commercial construction infrastructure industrial and homeowner or residential commercial construction which represents approximately 60 percent of our business as measured by revenues provides equipment rentals to support office retail lodging and healthcarerelated projects infrastructure which represents about 15 percent of our business as measured by revenues supports the development of bridges highways power plants and airports the industrial business which also represents about 15 percent of our business as measured by revenues provides equipment rentals to serve manufacturers chemical companies paper mills railroads ship builders and utilities our residential business which represents about 10 percent of our business as measured by revenues provides equipment rentals to support the construction and renovation of homes 

given the relative significance of commercial construction to our overall revenues our business is particularly sensitive to changes in activity in this endmarket according to the national bureau of economic research a recession in the united states began in december 2007 and as a consequence private nonresidential or commercial construction weakened throughout 2008 especially in the latter half of the year as the credit markets tightened based on a consensus of leading national nonresidential construction forecasts 

  

we expect commercial construction spending to decline by between 15 and 20 percent over the next one to two years with hotel and retail construction a significant component of commercial construction down approximately 20 percent although president obama’s economic stimulus package or the american recovery and reinvestment act may provide funds for nonresidential construction projects we believe those funds are not likely to become available before the latter part of 2009 and any such amounts would only partially offset the overall expected decline in our endmarkets 

although there are significant nearterm challenges–including cyclical pressure and the lack of availability of credit–that will suppress construction activity in 2009 and perhaps beyond we believe the longterm growth prospects of our industry are strong we believe that longterm us equipment rental growth in addition to reflecting eventual general economic expansion is driven by an endmarket that increasingly recognizes the many advantages of renting equipment rather than owning customers recognize that by renting they can 

 

  

  

  

 competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry which allows us to 

 

  

 in addition to these considerations we believe our recently intensified focus on serving national account and other large customers with a multiregional presence should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position 

significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies

sales force  we have approximately 2500 sales people including approximately 1300 outside sales representatives who frequently travel to customer jobsites and meet with customers and approximately 1200 inside sales people who work in our branches and at our national call center our sales people are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence our national account team which consists of approximately 60 sales professionals and includes those who service governmental agencies closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area 

erentals  our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our erentals portal which can be found at httpwwwurcom our customers can also use our ur data ® application to access realtime reports on their business activity with us 

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

  

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position the terms being offered product liability history and financial strength 

we have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 30 percent of our 2008 purchases of equipment measured on a dollar basis and that our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our ibm system i™ system located at our data center rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day 

these systems 

 

  

  

 our information technology systems and website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the us equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive as the largest equipment rental company in the industry we estimate that we have an approximate nine percent market share and that the four largest companies account for approximately 25 percent of industry revenue our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and 

  

certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand for additional information see “competitive advantages” above 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater storm water solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

in connection with our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and in anticipation of diminished construction activity in 2008 and 2009 we significantly reduced our employee headcount from approximately 12000 at january 1 2007 to approximately 10900 at january 1 2008 and approximately 9900 at january 1 2009 of these approximately 3300 are salaried personnel and approximately 6600 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 62 separate locations cover approximately 700 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec should any of these risks materialize our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities 

the current economic downturn and resulting decreases in north american construction and industrial activities has adversely affected our revenues and operating results and may further decrease the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge 

our rental equipment is used primarily in the nonresidential construction industry which is cyclical in nature trench safety pump and power equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities weakness in our end markets such as the decline in construction and industrial activity our industry has been experiencing as a result of the current recession has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and the prices that we can charge and will likely lead to further decreases such decreases adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and because certain of our costs are fixed our operating margins to be reduced 

  

the following factors among others may cause further weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers our operating results would be adversely affected 

one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere this has been particularly true in industries with high growth rates such as the construction industry however some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected further delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 

our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 

our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition prices in the stock market have been volatile in recent months in many cases the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies as a result the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our or our competitors’ operating performance 

our substantial debt exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2008 our total indebtedness was approximately 33 billion including 146 million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 

  

  

  

  

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 

  

  

  

  

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

  

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2008 we had 948 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represents 30 percent of our total indebtedness excluding our subordinated convertible debentures see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our “abl facility” we are required to among other things satisfy certain financial tests relating to i the fixed charge coverage ratio and ii the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda under our accounts receivable securitization facility we are required among other things to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio ii the delinquency ratio iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding if we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants the lenders could elect to terminate our abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor other agreements governing our debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we were able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace our abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and we would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity for our operations 

in addition to financial covenants we are subject to various other covenants in our abl facility accounts receivable securitization facility as well as in the other agreements governing our debt such as a requirement to file our periodic reports with the sec in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations for instance these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur additional indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends repurchase common stock make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under our abl facility andor other agreements governing our debt and the depth and duration of the current economic downturn in the event we seek to obtain equity financing our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

  

we are subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

multiple purported class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against the company as described in greater detail under item 3—legal proceedings these include three complaints that were filed following our november 14 2007 announcement that affiliates of cerberus had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement entered into with such persons these complaints which have been consolidated allege among other things that certain of the company’s filings with the sec including proxy materials in connection with the special meeting of stockholders and other public statements contained false and misleading statements andor material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with affiliates of cerberus each action asserts claims under sections 10b and 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” and sec rules 10b5 and 14a9 thereunder and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages costs expenses and fees we can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings or any other stockholder lawsuit pending against the company and if we do not prevail we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts further regardless of the outcome we may incur significant defense and indemnification costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs damages or settlement amounts such payments to the extent not covered advanced or timely reimbursed by insurance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

as previously reported on march 10 2008 we announced that we had entered into a memorandum of understanding with lead plaintiff’s counsel to settle an action consolidating three purported class action lawsuits that were filed following our august 2004 announcement of an sec inquiry into the company’s historical accounting practices the memorandum of understanding is subject to final court approval and although preliminary court approval has been received we cannot predict when or whether this final condition will be satisfied further we received a letter from counsel for an alleged stockholder which demands among other things that we investigate the agreement of our board of directors to enter into the memorandum of understanding while upon the recommendation of a new committee of independent directors our board determined that it would not be in the best interests of the company to take further action at this time we cannot predict whether the relevant stockholder will pursue this matter further 

former officers of ours are subject to an ongoing inquiry by the us attorney’s office for the district of connecticut which could adversely affect our results of operations and investor perceptions 

although as announced on september 8 2008 and described in greater detail under item 3—legal proceedings the sec inquiry described above was subsequently settled we continue to cooperate fully with the us attorney’s office for the district of connecticut which has requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry as a result we are likely to continue to incur additional expenses including indemnification costs and to experience diversion of management time and attention in connection with responding to such requests regardless of the outcome two of our former chief financial officers from prior to 2005 have been charged with securities fraud and other violations by both the us attorney’s office and the sec and one has pled guilty and the other is scheduled to go to trial in 2009 this trial and any additional charges against or settlements by any of our former officers may generate negative publicity and adversely affect the perception of the company by investors and others which in turn could affect the price of our securities our access to capital markets andor our borrowing costs we cannot predict the schedule or outcome of the trial or when these matters might be resolved 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employmentrelated claims further as 

  

described elsewhere in this report several stockholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claim or claims that exceed our established levels of reserves that cause us to significantly increase such reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in addition the purported class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with the sec and us attorney’s office inquiries may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions or consolidations that we may make in the future 

we have historically achieved a substantial portion of our growth through acquisitions although we have not made many acquisitions in recent years and the making of additional acquisitions is not a significant portion of our planned 2009 strategy we are always open to considering potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks 

  

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to expand our rental business over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our rights plan and charter provisions as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

we have in place a stockholders’ rights plan and certain charter provisions such as the inability for stockholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices as previously reported on october 16 2008 we amended our rights plan to reduce the beneficial ownership threshold required to trigger rights under the plan from a 25 percent ownership interest to a 15 percent ownership interest we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction in addition under our abl facility a change of control as defined in the credit agreement constitutes an event of default entitling our lenders to terminate our abl facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings a change of control as defined in the applicable agreement is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes including the new 14 percent senior notes due 2014 the “14 percent holdco notes” as a result the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world generally for top management talent is significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover given the recent declines in our stock price it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees particularly senior management through grants of stock or stock options this in turn could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages which may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect 

we are pursuing a strategy of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account customers and from other large customers we are also continuing to pursue an earlierstarted overall cost reduction program which achieved substantial cost savings in 2008 the extent to which these strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2009 and beyond is uncertain as their success depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetable we anticipate and there may be 

  

unforeseen productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that will adversely affect us therefore there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability margins or returns to stockholders 

we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms 

we have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and more recently nonequipment purchases however as a result we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into longterm and other significant procurement contracts we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses insolvency financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us further such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to the company or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment and other supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all 

continued deterioration in general economic and market conditions may further impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

continued deterioration in general economic and market conditions may further impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations for example the prevailing credit crisis may significantly affect the ability of the company to refinance existing indebtedness or to obtain additional financing in addition such conditions may result in further downward pressure on our stock price and market capitalization generally as previously announced during the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion we can provide no assurance that further declines in our stock price and market capitalization together with other considerations will not result in additional impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets or the need to conduct interim impairment reviews outside of our annual impairment test 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in addition because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous waste and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

we have operations throughout the united states which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor changes in applicable law regulations or requirements or our material failure to comply with any of them can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business 

our over 600 branch locations are located in 48 different states which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations such as worker safety consumer rights privacy employee benefits and more and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions changes in these requirements or any material failure by our branches to comply with them can increase our costs affect our reputation limit our business drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 700 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 9200 employees who are not represented by unions various unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers further settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs productivity and flexibility in addition pending federal legislation would make it easier for unions to organize by requiring employers to recognize unions based on card check authorization rather than by secret ballot election and would impose arbitration to settle firsttime collective bargaining agreements if the parties have not reached agreement within 120 days of recognition the enactment of such legislation could significantly increase labor costs in ways that are difficult to predict 

  

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another branch or one region to another region a significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if our maintenance and equipment replacement costs increase as our rental fleet ages and we are unable to pass along such costs our earnings will decrease 

as we age our fleet of rental equipment which we expect to do in 2009 the cost of maintaining such equipment if not replaced within a certain period of time may increase any increases in such costs will cause our earnings to decrease in addition the cost of the new equipment we use in our rental fleet is increasing and therefore we may spend more for replacement equipment these cost increases are due primarily to increased material costs including increases in the cost of steel which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use and increases in the cost of fuel which is used in the manufacturing process and in delivering equipment to us these increases could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect 

the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change both our depreciation expense as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections andor in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions and iii the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries

 as of january 1 2009 there were approximately 183 holders of record of our common stock we believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our common stock is held of record in broker “street names” 

  

dividend policy 

holdings has not paid dividends on its common stock since inception in 2008 holdings completed a “dutch auction” selftender at a premium to market for 2716 million shares of its common stock or approximately 314 percent of its then outstanding shares however the company does not expect in the foreseeable future to pay any dividends or make any further common stock repurchases other than in connection with equity award exercises and tax withholdings 

longerterm the payment of any future dividends or the authorization of stock repurchases or other recapitalizations will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing including earnings financial condition and capital requirements financing agreements business conditions stock price and other factors as discussed above the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain certain limitations on our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings andor to pay dividends on or effect repurchases of our common stock in addition under delaware law dividends may only be paid out of surplus or current or prior year’s net profits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated tableend we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 628 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 

we offer for rent over 2800 classes of rental equipment including construction equipment industrial and heavy machinery aerial work platforms trench safety equipment and homeowner items our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of used rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other in 2008 rental equipment revenues represented 76 percent of our total revenues 

in 2008 our strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins while also continuing to generate significant cash flow three key elements of this strategy were refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business optimizing the management of our rental fleet and reducing our operating costs our 2008 achievements in pursuing this strategy included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2009 we will continue to focus on our core rental business optimizing fleet management disciplined cost management and free cash generation additionally we will focus on optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness and increasing the proportion of our revenues which come from national account and other large customers to the extent we are successful at increasing the proportion of our revenue derived from these customers we believe that over the longterm we can improve our equipment rental gross margins and overall profitability as these accounts tend to have higher utilization and can be serviced more cost effectively in 2009 we also intend to actively pursue growth in industrial rentals where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage moreover industrial rentals are subject to different cyclical pressures than the commercial construction market where we are seeing demand continue to soften as spending is curtailed 

although we expect 2009 to be a challenging year for both our company and the us equipment rental industry generally we believe our strategy coupled with our broad geographic footprint extensive rental fleet advanced information technology systems disciplined purchasing power industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service will position us to weather the economic downturn and enable us to strengthen our leadership position and improve our returns to stockholders once economic conditions improve 

  

in june 2008 we commenced a modified “dutch auction” tender offer in which we offered to purchase up to 2716 million shares of our common stock at a price not less than 2200 nor greater than 2500 per share the tender offer expired in july 2008 and in accordance with the terms of the offer we accepted for payment an aggregate of 2716 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2200 per share for a total cost of 603 including fees and expenses the number of shares of common stock purchased in the tender offer represented approximately 314 percent of the total common stock outstanding on the last full trading day prior to the commencement of the offer 

also in june 2008 and in connection with our announcement of the tender offer we repurchased all of our outstanding series c and series d preferred stock a substantial majority of which was held by apollo investment fund iv lp and apollo overseas partners iv lp prior to this preferred stock repurchase a majority of the preferred holders had the right to consent to certain transactions by us including the aforementioned tender offer under the definitive repurchase agreement the total purchase price for the preferred stock was approximately 679 a portion of which was settled through the issuance by holdings of new 14 percent holdco notes in addition and as a result of the repurchase of the preferred stock leon black and michael gross the two directors elected by the former preferred holders in accordance with the terms of the series c preferred stock resigned from our board also in june 2008 holdings urna and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement providing for a new 1250 billion abl facility in connection with which urna repaid the amounts outstanding under its former revolving credit facility and term loan see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the abl facility which was subsequently upsized to 1285 billion and the repurchase of the preferred stock respectively 

as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative lawsuits and recently settled an sec inquiry the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company about matters related to the sec inquiry as previously discussed in the third quarter of 2008 we settled without admitting or denying the allegations in the sec’s complaint to the entry of a judgment requiring us to pay a civil penalty of 14 and disgorgement of one dollar and enjoining us from violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws in the future we cannot predict the outcome or other consequences of these matters as to the company and other than the reserve we have recognized as of december 31 2008 related to our contribution toward the settlement of the in re united rentals inc securities litigation discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we have not accrued any amounts related to their ultimate disposition any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred other costs associated with the sec inquiry the us attorney’s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits including reimbursement of attorneys’ fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors are expensed as incurred 

financial overview 

loss income from continuing operations  loss income from continuing operations and diluted loss earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

 2008 loss from continuing operations of 704 or 1262 per diluted share includes the following aftertax items i an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 911 or 1219 per diluted share ii a gain of 26 or 035 per diluted share related to the repurchase of 130 principal amount of outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes iii a charge of 14 or 019 per diluted share related to the settlement of the sec inquiry iv a charge of 14 or 018 per diluted share related to the aggregate impact of closing 75 branches 

  

during the year and impairing certain rental assets and v a charge of 8 or 010 per diluted share primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credits in addition to these matters 2008 diluted loss per share from continuing operations includes a 319 per diluted share preferred stock redemption charge associated with the june 2008 repurchase of our series c and d preferred stock the preferred stock redemption charge reduces income available to common stockholders for earningspershare purposes but does not affect net income 

2007 income from continuing operations of 363 or 326 per diluted share included an aftertax gain of 57 or 050 per diluted share related to the december 2007 termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus as well as net aftertax foreign currency transaction gains of 11 or 010 per diluted share 

ebitda gaap reconciliation  ebitda represents the sum of loss income from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes interest expense net interest expensesubordinated convertible debentures depreciationrental equipment goodwill impairment charge and nonrental depreciation and amortization proforma ebitda represents ebitda plus i the sum of the charges related to the settlement of the sec inquiry and branch closures net as well as the net foreign currency transaction loss less ii the sum of the merger termination benefit and net foreign currency transaction gain management believes that ebitda and proforma ebitda provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth however ebitda and proforma ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between loss income from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes and ebitda and proforma ebitda 

 

 for the year ended december 31 2008 ebitda decreased 235 or 186 percent primarily reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit due to the softening construction environment and the absence of the 91 merger termination benefit which enhanced our 2007 results the ebitda decline also reflects reduced sales of contractor supplies consistent with our strategy to focus on the higher margin core rental business as well as lower new and used equipment sales on a proforma basis our ebitda declined 99 or 85 percent also reflecting lower equipment rental gross profit and reduced revenues from our other lines of business we were able to partially offset the impact of these factors with savings realized from our ongoing initiatives to reduce operating costs and as a result improved our proforma ebitda margin by 12 percentage points to 324 percent 

for the year ended december 31 2007 ebitda increased 181 or 167 percent primarily reflecting higher equipment rental gross profit and savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives as well as the 91 

  

merger termination benefit and 17 of net foreign currency transaction gains on a proforma basis our ebitda increased 73 or 67 percent and our margin improved 13 percentage points to 312 percent also reflecting higher equipment rental gross profit as well as savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives 

revenues revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2008 total revenues of 33 billion decreased 121 percent compared with total revenues of 37 billion in 2007 the decrease primarily reflects a 59 percent decrease in equipment rental revenue a 439 percent decline in contractor supplies sales a 172 percent decline in used equipment sales and a 222 percent decline in new equipment sales the decrease in equipment rental revenue reflects a 31 percent decline in rental rates and a 04 percentage point decrease in time utilization the 439 percent decline in contractor supplies sales reflects the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business as a complementary offering to our core rental business the decline in used equipment sales primarily reflects volume declines as we focus on selling older assets in line with our lifecycle management strategy the decline in new equipment sales reflects volume declines in 2009 based on our analysis of industry forecasts and with consideration given to the broader economic and credit environment we expect our total revenues to decline 

2007 total revenues of 37 billion increased 24 percent compared with total revenues of 36 billion in 2006 the increase primarily reflects a 39 percent increase in equipment rental revenue partially offset by a 48 percent decline in used equipment sales and a 18 percent decline in contractor supplies sales the increase in equipment rental revenue reflects a 25 percentage point improvement in time utilization partially offset by a 11 percent decline in rental rates the decline in used equipment sales reflects volume declines and a shift in the mix of equipment sold the 18 percent decline in contractor supplies sales is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates andor judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates andor judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by the monthly term of 28 days as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

purchase price allocation  we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition with the exception of goodwill longlived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions the longlived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment transportation equipment and real estate with limited exceptions virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as “to be used” rather than as “to be sold” equipment that we acquire and classify as “to be used” is recorded at fair value as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 

in addition to longlived fixed assets we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets however when appropriate we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill customer relationships and covenants nottocompete goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed customer relationships and noncompete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 

evaluation of goodwill impairment  we have made numerous acquisitions over the years principally during the period between 1997 and 2000 that included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units or our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of stocks of corporations 

  

engaged in similar businesses we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a twostep process the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed in the second step the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 

inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plans expected growth rates cost of capital and tax rates we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions interest rates and other market data many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment the following assumptions are significant to our income approach 

 

  

  

 the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the assistance of a third party valuation firm and in connection with the preparation of our yearend financial statements we recognized an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the charge reflects the challenges of the current construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment and includes 10 billion reflecting conditions at the time of our annual october 1 testing date as well as an additional 100 as of december 31 reflecting further deterioration in the economic and credit environment during the fourth quarter substantially all of the impairment charge relates to goodwill arising out of acquisitions made by the company between 1997 and 2000 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies we generally evaluate projected taxable income over an appropriate 

  

period for each jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and in addition examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established in an amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs

segment operating income  segment operating income and operating margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 were as follows 

 

 the following is a reconciliation of segment operating income to total company operating loss income 

 

 general rentals for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 general rentals accounted for between 90 and 91 percent of our total operating income excluding the 2008 goodwill impairment charge this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ operating margin in 2008 decreased 16 percentage points from 2007 primarily reflecting a 36 percentage point reduction in gross margin from equipment rentals partially offset by the favorable impact of a shift in revenue mix resulting from our focus on higher margin equipment rentals and the benefits of costsavings initiatives general rentals’ operating margin in 2007 increased 06 percentage points from 2006 primarily resulting from the realization of the initial benefits of costsaving initiatives implemented in 2007 

trench safety pump and power  for the year ended december 31 2008 operating income decreased by 4 and operating margin increased by 06 percentage points from 2007 reflecting reduced gross margins from equipment rentals and improved selling general and administrative leverage operating income in 2007 declined 1 from 2006 reflecting slight declines in gross profit on new equipment sales and contractor supplies partially offset by an increase in gross profit on sales of rental equipment 

  

gross margin  we have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment this is consistent with the marketplace in general and not unique to united rentals gross margins by revenue classification were as follows 

 

 2008 gross margin of 338 percent declined 15 percentage points from 2007 primarily reflecting a 34 percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals partially offset by a 46 percentage point improvement in gross margin on contractor supplies sales the decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects a 31 percent decline in rental rates partially offset by savings realized from our ongoing cost savings initiatives additionally equipment rentals gross margin was adversely impacted by charges of 20 related to the aggregate impact of closing 75 branches during the year and impairing certain rental assets the increase in contractor supplies gross margin is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business by focusing on higher margin products and reducing the number of our distribution centers from nine to two in 2009 we expect our gross margins on equipment rentals to decline as industrywide rental rates come under further pressure additionally we expect our 2009 gross margins from the sales of rental equipment to decline as companies look to defleet in a softening construction environment 

2007 gross margin of 353 percent declined 03 percentage points from 2006 reflecting a 03 percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals a 30 percentage point decline in gross margin on sales of rental equipment and a 26 percentage point decline in gross margin on contractor supplies partially offset by a 33 percentage point improvement in gross margin on service and other revenues the decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects increased rental costs and a 11 percent decline in rental rates partially offset by a 25 percentage point improvement in time utilization the decline in gross margins on sales of rental equipment and contractor supplies reflects pricing pressure as well as a shift in the mix of product sold the increase in margin on service and other revenues reflects increased revenue 

selling general and administrative sga expenses  sga expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

 sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees advertising and marketing expenses management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 

2008 sga expense of 514 declined 84 or 140 percent compared to 2007 and declined by 04 percentage points as a percentage of revenue this decline reflects the benefits we realized from our cost saving initiatives including reduced compensation costs and travel expenses partially offset by normal inflationary increases and a 7 increase in bad debt expense the increase in bad debt expense reflects a deterioration in 2008 in accounts receivable collection experience and writeoff trends as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements our results for 2008 also include a net benefit of 3 related to the settlement of a 

  

consolidated class action lawsuit previously filed against the company related to the sec inquiry this net benefit which was recognized as a reduction of sga expense during 2008 reflects the fact that the company’s contribution to the settlement was more than offset by the fourth quarter 2008 reimbursement of related professional fees that had been previously expensed by the company excluding the impact of the net benefit our professional fees for regulatory matters were 8 in 2008 as compared to 9 in 2007 

2007 sga expense of 598 declined 19 or 31 percent compared to 2006 and declined by 09 percentage points as a percentage of revenue this decline reflects a 13 reduction in professional fees related to regulatory matters the initial benefits of our costsaving initiatives reduced incentive compensation costs and a 3 reduction in bad debt expense the benefit associated with these matters was partially offset by severance costs associated with headcount reductions completed in the second half of 2007 the amendment of our former chairman’s service agreement charges associated with the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award held by our former chief executive officer upon his june 4 2007 retirement as well as normal inflationary increases 

charge related to settlement of sec inquiry  our results for the year ended december 31 2008 include a 14 charge which was recognized in the second quarter and represented our best estimate for the liability associated with this matter as previously announced and as further discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in september 2008 we announced that we had reached a final settlement with the sec and we paid a civil penalty of 14 

goodwill impairment charge  as discussed above see “critical accounting policies—evaluation of goodwill impairment” and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded an aggregate noncash goodwill impairment charge of 11 billion related to certain reporting units within our general rentals segment the impairment charge reflects the challenges of the current construction cycle as well as the broader economic and credit environment 

nonrental depreciation and amortization for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

 nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as ii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as well as customerrelated intangible assets the increase in 2008 and 2007 expense levels principally relates to a higher basis of depreciable assets 

interest expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

 interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased by 13 or 70 percent primarily due to the 45 gain on the repurchase of our senior and senior subordinated notes discussed above partially offset by the impact of our increased debt following the preferred stock repurchase and completion of the tender offer and a noncash charge of 6 relating to the aggregate impact of the retirement of 125 of the principal amount of the 14 percent holdco notes as well as the retirement of our former credit facility and term loan interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 21 or 101 percent compared to 2006 reflecting lower average debt balances the 9 benefit we recognized related to the marktomarket impact of certain interest rate swaps and the absence of a 6 charge we incurred in 2006 related to our term loan prepayment and the retirement of subordinated convertible debentures 

  

interest expense—subordinated convertible debentures for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

 as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued quarterly income preferred securities “quips” this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was 146 the decline in interest expense subordinated convertible debentures from 2006 to 2007 reflects the retirement of 76 of these subordinated convertible debentures in the second half of 2006 

other income expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 was as follows 

 

 in april 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the commencement of a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value including a possible sale of the company in july 2007 we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to be acquired by affiliates of cerberus in december 2007 following the termination of that merger agreement we received a breakup fee of 100 other income for 2007 includes the income associated with the receipt of the breakup fee net of related transaction costs of 9 other income for 2007 also includes 17 of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar and our us subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a longterm investment nature exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change prior to 2007 we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity rather than including them in income our results for 2007 include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter of the 17 recognized in 2007 13 relates to 2007 exchange rate movements and 4 relates to prior periods this correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its effect on our prior years’ net income cash flows from operations and stockholders’ equity is not material 

income taxes  the following table summarizes our continuing operations benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 134 percent 372 percent and 385 percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items additionally 2008 reflects the nondeductibility of a 

  

portion of the 11 billion goodwill impairment charge as well as the nondeductibility of the 14 charge related to the settlement of the sec inquiry additionally 2007 includes a benefit associated with the release of state tax valuation allowances partially offset by certain nondeductible compensation expense and prior year state tax matters our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 

recent accounting pronouncements  see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

as previously discussed in july 2008 in connection with a modified “dutch auction” tender offer we accepted for payment an aggregate of 2716 shares of our common stock at a price of 2200 per share for a total cost of 603 including fees and expenses also in june 2008 and in connection with our announcement of the tender offer we repurchased all of outstanding series c and series d preferred stock for approximately 679 pursuant to the repurchase agreement with the preferred holders holdings issued to the former preferred holders 425 aggregate principal amount of the 14 percent holdco notes in partial payment of the repurchase price of the preferred stock in september 2008 we prepaid 125 of the principal amount of these notes 

in anticipation of the share repurchases in june 2008 holdings urna and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement providing for a new 1250 billion abl facility a portion of which is available in canadian dollars and repaid the 462 outstanding under our former revolving credit facility and term loan the balance of the amounts necessary for the share repurchases the repayment of our former credit facility and term loan as well as related fees and expenses was funded with existing cash on hand and through borrowings under the abl facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility for additional information concerning the abl facility which has recently been upsized to 1285 billion and the 14 percent holdco notes see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements  

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2008 we had i 505 of borrowing capacity available under our abl facility ii 35 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of 77 cash equivalents at december 31 2008 consist of high quality low risk investments we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate or through the use of additional operating leases for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we estimate that our net rental capital expenditures which we define as purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment for 2009 to decline to 

  

approximately 100 from 360 in 2008 in line with our expectations for reduced construction activity and a challenging economic environment we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment and if required borrowings available under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 

retirement of senior and senior subordinated notes as discussed above in the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 130 principal amount of our outstanding 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 7 3  4 percent senior subordinated notes due 2013 and 7 percent senior subordinated notes due 2014 interest expense for 2008 includes a gain of 45 representing the difference between the net carrying amount of these securities and the total purchase price of 82 

loan covenants and compliance  as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our abl facility the senior notes the quips and our accounts receivable securitization facility any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

we consider our most restrictive covenant to be the fixed charge coverage ratio which is the ratio of our adjusted ebitda to our interest expense as defined in our abl facility the minimum amount permitted under this covenant is 110 to 10 and our actual fixed charge coverage ratio for the year ended december 31 2008 was 262 to 10 

as of december 31 2008 primarily due to our goodwill impairment charge we no longer had any restricted payment capacity under our 6 1  2 percent senior notes due 2012 this depletion limits our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings although certain intercompany arrangements are excepted 

sources and uses of cash—continuing operations  during 2008 we i generated cash from operations of 764 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 275 and iii received proceeds net of payments on debt of 279 principally related to our abl facility we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 704 ii repurchase common stock of 603 and iii redeem our preferred stock of 257 during 2007 we i generated cash from operations of 859 including the 100 termination fee we received from cerberus less transaction related costs of 9 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 342 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 990 and ii fund payments on debt net of proceeds received of 71 additionally during 2007 we received net proceeds of 66 related to the sale of our traffic control business 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities—continuing operations less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

 

   

in 2008 we generated free cash flow of 335 compared to 242 in 2007 this increase reflects lower capital expenditures in 2008 consistent with our expectation for reduced construction activity and a challenging economic environment partially offset by lower cash generated from operating activities 2007 free cash flow which includes 91 of proceeds related to the termination of the cerberus transaction increased 7 compared to 2006 excluding the impact of the merger benefit free cash flow in 2007 declined 84 or 36 percent primarily reflecting lower cash generated from operating activities 

our credit ratings as of february 23 2009 were as follows 

 

  

 both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the noninvestment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

  

      

   certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements  we lease real estate and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of some of our nonrental equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 14 under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees however we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2008 or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 

relationship between holdings and urna  holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary urna and subsidiaries of urna holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and taxrelated services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisitionrelated services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 

interest rate risk  during 2007 and earlier periods we utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion the effect of the swap agreements was at december 31 2007 to convert 12 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments in january 2008 we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements and made a payment of 4 there were no outstanding derivative contracts including interest rate swap or cap agreements at december 31 2008 

as of december 31 2008 we had an aggregate of 948 of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates as of december 31 2008 the variable rate debt included 689 of borrowings under our abl facility and 259 of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2008 were i 44 percent for the abl facility and ii 21 percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility as of december 31 2008 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 6 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2008 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2008 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

 item 1 business tableend general 

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of 697 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico we offer for rent over 2900 classes of rental equipment including heavy machines and hand tools to customers that include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and others in 2007 we generated revenue of 37 billion including 26 billion of equipment rental revenue 

as of december 31 2007 our fleet of rental equipment included over 260000 units having an original purchase price based on initial consideration paid of 42 billion as compared to 39 billion at december 31 2006 the fleet includes 

 

  

  

  

 in addition to renting equipment we sell new and used rental equipment as well as related contractor supplies parts and service 

strategy 

in the second half of 2007 in response to internal analyses and a study we commissioned from a nationallyrecognized consulting firm we began to implement a change in strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins while also continuing to generate significant cash flow the three key elements of this strategy are refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business optimizing the management of our rental fleet and reducing our operating costs 

  

we believe this strategy coupled with our broad geographic footprint extensive rental fleet advanced information technology systems disciplined purchasing power industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service will enable us to strengthen our leadership position in the equipment rental industry and improve our returns to shareholders in particular we plan to achieve our objectives by 

optimizing our field operations we intend to continue the process of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve fleet allocation service and delivery and sales management efforts we expect this process will create opportunities for rental location closures as fleet assets are moved from lowreturn locations to highreturn locations as well as additional costsaving opportunities from the consolidation of administrative and backoffice functions we believe optimizing our field operations will increase equipment utilization and reduce operating costs 

reducing operating costs in an effort to bring our cost structure in line with those of other leading equipment rental companies in the spring of 2007 we undertook a thorough review of our backoffice functions related to the general and administrative aspects of our business in order to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies as a result of this process we identified a number of opportunities to consolidate duplicative functions outsource certain backoffice operations and automate processes as a result we have implemented a headcount reduction program that as of december 31 2007 had achieved a 9 percent workforce reduction as compared to december 31 2006 and undertaken specific initiatives to reduce our selling general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold 

accelerating sourcing initiatives our rental equipment purchases have been centralized for many years which we believe has enabled us to negotiate more favorable pricing and other terms from our equipment providers we launched a strategic sourcing initiative in 2006 that was designed to centralize our nonequipment purchases we believe that centralizing the procurement of these items will allow us to leverage our significant purchasing power to obtain better pricing andor terms from our suppliers to date we have realized approximately 22 million in cumulative savings across a wide range of products and we expect additional savings associated with this initiative in 2008 

optimizing time utilization we continue to reassess existing fleet investments and have recently realigned certain of our incentive programs to reward equipment sharing across districts and increase the time utilization of our rental fleet additionally we intend to better allocate resources including limited growth capital to where there is strong customer demand resulting in fleet rationalization opportunities by coupling such initiatives with an increased focus on preventative maintenance and improved turnaround time for returned equipment we believe we can further increase the time utilization of our rental fleet which was up 25 percentage points yearoveryear in 2007 

refocusing contractor supplies business we sell a variety of contractor supplies such as construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies through several channels including our sales representatives rental branches and us and canadian product catalogues although revenues from the contractor supplies business grew from 125 million in 2002 to 378 million in 2007 this business has required us to maintain significant volumes of inventory in order to meet customer demand and carries a higher cost structure relative to our core equipment rental business in 2007 the gross margin for our contractor supplies business was 190 percent as compared to 387 percent for equipment rentals 

we have refocused our contractor supplies business and positioned it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business we expect this to result in productivity improvements within our sales force thus helping to improve the utilization of our rental fleet as part of this initiative we are reducing the number of stock keeping units associated with these operations especially in lower margin commodity categories additionally we have recently closed three of our nine distribution centers and we intend to close an additional two distribution centers in the first half of 2008 we expect these changes will reduce our revenues associated with contractor supplies but improve our margins 

  

industry overview 

based on industry sources we estimate that the us equipment rental industry had total revenues of approximately 37 billion in 2007 this represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent since 1990 

our principal endmarket for rental equipment is private nonresidential construction and our business is particularly sensitive to changes in activity in this endmarket according to us department of commerce data which has not been adjusted for inflation private nonresidential construction activity increased 50 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 increased 162 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 and increased 167 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting current economic conditions we and other forecasters expect this growth to slow significantly in 2008—most likely flat as compared to 2007 or low single digit growth 

approximately 10 percent of our revenues have historically been derived from private residential construction where activity decreased 183 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 based on the same department of commerce data with further decreases expected in 2008 this market primarily impacts our southwest and southeast regions 

we believe that longterm industry growth in addition to reflecting general economic expansion is driven by an enduser market that increasingly recognizes the many advantages of renting equipment rather than owning customers recognize that by renting they can 

 

  

  

  

 while the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment industrial companies utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance plant changeovers and other operations requiring the periodic use of equipment we believe that over the longterm increasing rentals by governmental entities and the industrial sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry which allows us to 

 

  

 significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies

strong brand recognition  we have strong brand recognition which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty 

geographic and customer diversity  we have 697 rental locations in 48 states ten canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners we believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including i enabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations ii helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across north america iii reducing our dependence on any particular customer and iv reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance 

national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs we currently serve approximately 1500 national account customers as well as approximately 200 agencies within the united states government combined revenues from national account customers and government agencies have increased to approximately 775 million in 2007 from approximately 700 million in 2006 and approximately 625 million in 2005 reflecting the growth and success of this program 

strong and motivated branch management  each of our full service branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager from one of our 92 districts and a vice president from one of our 11 regions we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them within budgetary guidelines to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters each region office has a management team that monitors branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews 

employee training programs  we are dedicated to providing training and development to our employees in 2007 our employees enhanced their skills through over 485000 hours of training many employees participated in one of eight weeklong programs held in 2007 at our training facility located at our corporate headquarters in addition to these training sessions our employees are provided equipmentrelated training from our suppliers as well as online elearning courses covering a variety of subjects 

risk management and safety programs  we believe that we have one of the most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry our risk management department is staffed by experienced 

  

professionals and is responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures developing our employee and customer training programs and in coordination with third party professionals managing any claims against us

we principally sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america we also sell used equipment through our website which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale in addition we hold united rentals certified auctions on ebay to provide customers with another convenient online tool for purchasing used equipment

customers 

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our largest customer accounted for less than 1 percent of our revenues in 2007 and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 2 percent of our revenues in 2007 historically we have typically retained over 90 percent of our customer base yearoveryear 

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy our customers include 

 

  

  

  

 our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 

sales and marketing 

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

sales force  we have over 2700 sales people including approximately 1400 outside sales representatives and 1300 inside sales people our sales people are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

  

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position product liability history and financial strength 

we have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 38 percent of our 2007 purchases of equipment for rental or resale and that our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

information technology systems 

in support of our rental business we have advanced information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our as400 system located at our data center rental transactions are entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management branch and call center personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day 

these systems 

 

  

  

 our information technology systems and our website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand for additional information see “competitive advantages” 

  

securities and exchange commission inquiry 

as previously reported and as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report the company is the subject of a nonpublic factfinding inquiry by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” that appears to relate to a broad range of the company’s accounting practices prior to 2005 and does not otherwise seem to be confined to a specific time period the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry the company is cooperating fully with the sec and the us attorney’s office 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater storm water solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations 

employees 

we had approximately 10900 employees at january 1 2008 as compared to approximately 12000 at january 1 2007 of these approximately 3400 are salaried personnel and approximately 7500 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 68 separate locations cover approximately 800 of our employees we monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

terminated merger agreement 

on july 22 2007 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with ram holdings inc and ram acquisition corp collectively the “ram entities” each an affiliate of cerberus capital management lp “cerberus” the merger agreement contemplated that the ram entities would acquire the company by among other things paying 3450 for each outstanding share of our common stock on november 14 2007 the ram entities notified us that although there had not been any material adverse change in our business in light of current credit market conditions they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement on november 19 2007 we sued the ram entities in delaware chancery court seeking specific performance of the merger agreement on december 21 2007 in an opinion issued after a bench trial that court declined to compel the ram entities to complete their purchase of the company in light of that opinion on december 23 2007 we terminated the merger agreement and requested and received prompt payment from the ram entities of the 100 million termination fee contemplated by the merger agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend our results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec should any of these risks materialize our business financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 

decreases in north american construction and industrial activities could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge 

our rental equipment is used primarily in the nonresidential construction industry which is cyclical in nature trench safety pump and power equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities weakness in our end markets such as a decline in construction or industrial activity may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge any such decrease could adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues and gross profit margins to be reduced 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 

  

  

  

  

 our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 our substantial debt exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2007 our total indebtedness was approximately 27 billion including 146 million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 

  

  

  

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 

  

  

  

  

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2007 including the effect of our interest rate swap agreements we had approximately 17 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represents 65 percent of our total indebtedness excluding our subordinated convertible debentures in january 2008 we terminated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion had these swaps been terminated as of december 31 2007 18 percent of our total debt excluding our subordinated convertible debentures would have been floating rate debt see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk 

notwithstanding our current indebtedness level we believe we are able to incur and carry substantially more debt if we do so this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt 

we believe we would be able to incur and service substantial additional indebtedness in the future should business conditions or decisions so warrant although the terms of our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and 

  

exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial to the extent new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the substantial debt risks described above would increase 

we are subject to an ongoing inquiry by the sec 

we are the subject of a nonpublic factfinding inquiry by the sec that appears to relate to a broad range of the company’s accounting practices prior to 2005 and does not seem otherwise to be confined to a specific time period in august 2004 we issued a press release and filed a form 8k disclosing the existence of the sec inquiry in march 2005 our board of directors formed the special committee of independent directors to review matters related to the sec inquiry our board of directors received and acted upon findings of the special committee in january 2006 the actions that we took with respect to the special committee’s findings and actions that we took with respect to certain other accounting matters including the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 our “2005 form 10k” 

we are cooperating with the sec in its ongoing inquiry the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry we are also cooperating fully with this office however we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries or when these matters might be resolved in july 2007 the staff of the sec advised us that it intends to seek commission authorization to seek injunctive and monetary relief against us as well as to engage in settlement discussions with us 

these matters have the potential to adversely affect us in a number of ways including the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we are ultimately required to pay significant amounts andor take significant corrective actions our results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of the outcome the publicity surrounding the inquiries and the potential risks associated with the inquiries could negatively impact the perception of the company by investors and others which could adversely affect the price of our securities our access to the capital markets andor our borrowing costs 

we are subject to certain ongoing class action lawsuits 

multiple class action lawsuits have been filed against the company as described in greater detail under item 3—legal proceedings three complaints were filed following our public announcement of the sec inquiry these complaints which have been consolidated allege among other things that i certain of the company’s sec filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements which resulted in damages to the plaintiffs and the members of the purported class when they purchased the company’s securities and ii the conduct in connection therewith violated section 10b of the exchange act sec rule 10b5 and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the consolidated amended complaint asserts the same claims and seeks unspecified compensatory damages costs and expenses 

  

three complaints were filed following our november 14 2007 announcement that affiliates of cerberus had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement these complaints which have been consolidated allege among other things that certain of the company’s filings with the sec including proxy materials in connection with the special meeting of stockholders and other public statements contained false and misleading statements andor material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with affiliates of cerberus each action asserts claims under sections 10b and 14a of the exchange act and sec rules 10b5 and 14a9 and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages costs expenses and fees 

we can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings and if we do not prevail we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts further regardless of the outcome we may incur significant defense and indemnification costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs damages or settlement amounts such payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employment related claims further as described elsewhere in this report several shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claims that exceed our established levels of reserves that cause us to significantly increase such reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition the class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with the sec and us attorney’s office inquiries may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or not available at all 

we have made numerous acquisitions in the past which entail certain risks as do any growth initiatives including additional acquisitions or consolidations that we may make in the future 

we have historically achieved a substantial portion of our growth through acquisitions although we have not made many acquisitions in recent years and the making of additional acquisitions is not a planned portion of 

  

our 2008 strategy we are always open to considering potential acquisitions on a selective basis from timetotime we have also approached or been approached to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privatelyheld companies 

whether historical or in the future it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing which involves its own risks 

we have also spent resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow our business operations over the past few years these efforts place strains on our management and other personnel and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

our capital stock and charter structures as well as other factors may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company 

our series c preferred and series d preferred stock as described in more detail in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements have certain rights that may impact the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company these provisions include the right of the holders of the series c preferred to directly elect two directors to our board subject to reduction if their holdings are reduced they also include the rights of the holders of both the series c and series d preferred to have their shares redeemed at certain levels providing a guaranteed rate of return on their investment in the event of a boardapproved change of control and at certain levels providing a higher guaranteed rate of return and other rights including the right to elect a majority of our board in the event of a change of control that has not been approved by our board combined with a failure to offer the holders of the preferred stock the redemption rights they would have in an approved change of control context as a result the interests of the holders of our preferred stock may be different from and affect those of the holders of our common stock in a change of control scenario in addition as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a stockholders’ rights plan and certain charter provisions such as the inability for shareholders to act by written consent that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that together with affiliates owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction 

  

our preferred stock and debt agreements limit our board’s ability to pay dividends repurchase shares or otherwise return capital to our common stockholders 

the terms of our series c preferred and series d preferred stock restrict us from paying or making any “extraordinary dividend” without the consent of the holders thereof generally this limitation applies to any dividends made on or tender offers made for our common stock if the aggregate amount of such dividends and repurchases would exceed 5 percent of our market capitalization at the time of payment tested on a rolling 12month basis if common stock repurchases are made other than by means of a tender offer the limitation inclusive of any common stock dividends and repurchases through tender offers is 75 percent of our market capitalization measured and tested the same way which increases to a 10 percent limitation beginning in early 2009 

although currently less restrictive in the aggregate amount than the abovedescribed provisions the indentures governing our highyield debt and the agreement governing our credit facility also contain restrictions on making what are known as “restricted payments”—which typically are defined to include most cash payments to common stockholders whether through dividends or common stock repurchases 

turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy 

our success is dependent in part on the experience and skills of our management team and competition in our industry and the business world generally for top management talent is significant although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages we can provide no assurances that our efforts to attract and retain senior management staff will be successful moreover the termination of the merger agreement with cerberus affiliates the resulting drop in our stock price and our continued operation under the stewardship of an interim chief executive officer have created perceived uncertainties that may result in increased difficulties and expense in recruiting and retaining employees particularly senior management if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy 

our cost reduction programs may not achieve the cost savings and operational improvements and efficiencies we expect and we may have to implement further cost reduction programs and incur additional related charges 

in 2007 we implemented a workforce reduction program a strategic sourcing initiative and other initiatives designed to reduce operating costs and increase organizational efficiencies though we have already realized substantial cost savings and operational improvements from these efforts the extent to which we achieve our remaining and any additional goals will depend on a number of factors some of which are beyond our control even if we take all of the steps that we expect to take we may not achieve the cost reduction and operational efficiencies we anticipate the reductions and efficiencies we do achieve may not be realized on the timetable we anticipate and there may be productivity revenue or other consequences resulting from such programs and initiatives that will adversely effect us therefore the anticipated benefits of our existing and future cost saving initiatives may not be fully realized 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility we are required to among other things satisfy certain financial tests relating to a the interest coverage ratio b the ratio of funded debt to cash flow c the ratio of senior secured debt to tangible assets and d the ratio of senior secured debt to cash flow if we 

  

are unable to satisfy any of these covenants the lenders could elect to terminate our senior secured credit facility andor other agreements governing our debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we were able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace our senior secured credit facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and we would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity for our operations in addition to financial covenants we are subject to various other covenants in our senior secured credit facility as well as in the other agreements governing our debt such as a requirement to file our periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner for example when we were not current with our sec periodic reports as a result of our restatement process described above in 2005 we paid in excess of 34 million in consent solicitation fees with respect to our public debt indentures in order to address noncompliance with such a covenant 

in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations for instance these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness 

goodwill related to acquisitions represents a substantial portion of our total assets if the fair value of the goodwill should drop below the recorded value we would be required to writeoff the excess goodwill 

on december 31 2007 we had goodwill of 14 billion on our balance sheet which represented approximately 23 percent of our total assets as of such date this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses of the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at december 31 2007 94 percent is associated with our general rentals segment and 6 percent is associated with our trench safety pump and power segment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually our results in 2004 were adversely affected by the writeoff of approximately 139 million of goodwill related to our discontinued traffic control operations and our results in the preceding two years were also adversely affected by significant goodwill writeoffs based on the current performance of our general rentals and trench safety pump and power segments as well as current market conditions we do not currently anticipate significant goodwill writeoffs however in previous years we recorded significant goodwill writeoffs and we cannot be certain that a future downturn in the business or changes in market conditions will not necessitate additional writeoffs in future periods 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing 

  

competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our operating results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 800 employees that are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 10100 employees that are not represented by unions various unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers in addition these efforts could negatively affect our relationship with certain customers further our labor costs could increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another branch or one region to another region a significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations as well as us laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions and iii the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries

we have not paid dividends on our common stock since inception however the payment of any future dividends or the authorization of stock repurchases or other recapitalizations will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements restrictions in financing agreements business conditions stock price and other factors the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and the terms of our outstanding preferred stock as discussed above contain certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends on or effect repurchases of our common stock in addition under delaware law dividends may only be paid out of capital surplus or current or prior year’s net profits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated tableend executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 697 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 

we offer for rent over 2900 classes of rental equipment including construction equipment industrial and heavy machinery aerial work platforms trench safety equipment and homeowner items our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of used rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other in 2007 rental equipment revenues represented 70 percent of our total revenues we expect this percentage to increase to approximately 77 percent in 2008 as we reposition our contractor supplies business and sell less used equipment 

in the second half of 2007 in response to internal analyses and a study we commissioned from a nationallyrecognized consulting firm we began to implement a change in strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins while also continuing to generate significant cash flow the three key elements of this strategy are refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business optimizing the management of our rental fleet and reducing our operating costs 

we believe this strategy coupled with our broad geographic footprint extensive rental fleet advanced information technology systems disciplined purchasing power industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service will enable us to strengthen our leadership position in the equipment rental industry and improve our returns to shareholders in particular we plan to achieve our objectives by 

optimizing our field operations we intend to continue the process of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve fleet allocation service and delivery and sales management efforts we expect this process will create opportunities for rental location closures as fleet assets are moved from lowreturn locations to highreturn locations as well as additional costsaving opportunities from the consolidation of administrative and backoffice functions we believe optimizing our field operations will increase equipment utilization and reduce operating costs 

reducing operating costs in an effort to bring our cost structure in line with those of other leading equipment rental companies in the spring of 2007 we undertook a thorough review of our backoffice functions related to the general and administrative aspects of our business in order to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies as a result of this process we identified a number of opportunities to consolidate duplicative functions outsource certain backoffice operations and automate processes as a result we have implemented a headcount reduction program that as of december 31 2007 had achieved a 9 percent workforce reduction as compared to december 31 2006 and undertaken specific initiatives to reduce our selling general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold 

accelerating sourcing initiatives our rental equipment purchases have been centralized for many years which we believe has enabled us to negotiate more favorable pricing and other terms from our equipment providers we launched a strategic sourcing initiative in 2006 that was designed to centralize our nonequipment purchases we believe that centralizing the procurement of these items will allow us to leverage our significant purchasing power to obtain better pricing andor terms from our suppliers to date we have realized approximately 22 in cumulative savings across a wide range of products and we expect additional savings associated with this initiative in 2008 

  

optimizing time utilization we continue to reassess existing fleet investments and have recently realigned certain of our incentive programs to reward equipment sharing across districts and increase the time utilization of our fleet assets additionally we intend to better allocate resources including limited growth capital to where there is strong customer demand resulting in fleet rationalization opportunities by coupling such initiatives with an increased focus on preventative maintenance and improved turnaround time for returned equipment we believe we can further increase the time utilization of our fleet which was up 25 percentage points yearoveryear in 2007 

refocusing contractor supplies business we sell a variety of contractor supplies such as construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies through several channels including our sales representatives rental branches and us and canadian product catalogues although revenues from the contractor supplies business grew from 125 in 2002 to 378 in 2007 this business has required us to maintain significant volumes of inventory in order to meet customer demand and carries a higher cost structure relative to our core equipment rental business in 2007 the gross margin for our contractor supplies business was 190 percent as compared to 387 percent for equipment rentals 

we have refocused our contractor supplies business and positioned it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business we expect this to result in productivity improvements within our sales force thus helping to improve equipment utilization as part of this initiative we are reducing the number of stock keeping units associated with these operations especially in lower margin commodity categories additionally we have recently closed three of our nine distribution centers and we intend to close an additional two distribution centers in the first half of 2008 we expect these changes will reduce our revenues associated with contractor supplies but improve our margins 

as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative suits as well as the subject of an sec inquiry the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company about matters related to the sec inquiry although we have not accrued any amounts related to the ultimate disposition of these matters to date any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred other costs associated with the sec inquiry the us attorney’s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits including reimbursement of attorneys’ fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors are expensed as incurred 

financial overview 

income from continuing operations  income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

 2007 income from continuing operations of 363 or 326 per diluted share was a record for the company and included an aftertax gain of 57 or 050 per diluted share related to the recent termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus see other income below excluding the merger termination benefit our income from continuing operations of 306 which was also a record for the company increased 229 percent from 249 for 2006 2006 income from continuing operations of 249 or 228 per diluted share increased 233 percent from 202 for 2005 for 2008 we are forecasting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 280300 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment and excess tax benefits 

  

from sharebased payment arrangements management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

 

  

 in 2007 we reported revenues and free cash flow of 37 billion and 242 respectively our 2007 equipment rental revenue growth of 40 percent trailed our primary end market private nonresidential construction which grew 167 percent in 2007 according to department of commerce data which has not been adjusted for inflation the lag in growth rate between our equipment rental revenue and our primary end market primarily reflects a more targeted allocation of our growth capital which we deliberately did not increase to a level that would have kept pace on a nationwide basis with industry demand our 25 percent overall revenue growth which includes rental revenue growth of 40 percent reflects a 25 percentage point improvement in time utilization to 640 percent partially offset by a 11 percent decline in rental rates free cash flow for 2007 includes 100 of cash we received following the termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus capital management lp “cerberus” less transaction related costs of 9 see other income below 

in 2006 we reported revenues and free cash flow of 36 billion and 235 respectively our 2006 equipment rental revenue growth of 82 percent trailed our primary end market private nonresidential construction which grew 162 percent in 2006 according to department of commerce data our 107 percent revenue growth which includes equipment rental growth of 82 percent reflects increased rental rates of 51 percent partially offset by a 03 percentage point decline in time utilization to 615 percent in addition to generating significant revenue and free cash flow growth in 2006 we reduced our total debt including our subordinated convertible debentures by 450 

revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

   

equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2007 total revenues of 37 billion increased 25 percent compared with total revenues of 36 billion in 2006 the increase primarily reflects a 40 percent increase in equipment rental revenue partially offset by a 48 percent decline in used equipment sales the increase in equipment rental revenue reflects a 25 percentage point improvement in time utilization partially offset by a 11 percent decline in rental rates the decline in used equipment sales reflects volume declines and a shift in the mix of equipment sold the 18 percent decline in contractor supplies sales is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business looking forward we expect contractor supplies and used equipment sales to decline by approximately 40 percent and 35 percent respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 these anticipated reductions are consistent with our refocus on the core rental business as well as our efforts to improve time utilization 

2006 total revenues of 36 billion increased 107 percent compared with total revenues of 33 billion in 2005 the increase primarily reflects an 82 percent increase in equipment rentals and a 279 percent increase in contractor supplies sales the increase in equipment rentals reflects a 51 percent increase in rental rates partially offset by a 03 percentage point decline in time utilization to 615 percent the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates and judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by 28 days the monthly term as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

  

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

purchase price allocation  we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition with the exception of goodwill longlived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions the longlived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment transportation equipment and real estate with limited exceptions virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as “to be used” rather than as “to be sold” equipment that we acquire and classify as “to be used” is recorded at fair value as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 

in addition to longlived fixed assets we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets however when appropriate we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill customer relationships and covenants nottocompete goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed customer relationships and noncompete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies we generally evaluate projected taxable income over an appropriate period for each jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and in addition examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

  

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs 

results of operations 

as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety pump and power the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction aerial industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities the general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities and homeowners the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico the trench safety pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services the trench safety pump and power segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects municipalities and industrial companies this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 

these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 

we completed acquisitions in each of 2007 2006 and 2005 which are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions we believe that our results for these periods are not fully directly comparable although there is no material impact from these acquisitions 

  

revenues by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals 2007 equipment rentals of 263 billion increased 100 or 40 percent reflecting a 25 percentage point increase in time utilization on a larger fleet partially offset by a 11 percent decline in rental rates and a shift in the mix of equipment on rent equipment rentals represented 70 percent of total revenues in 2007 on a segment basis equipment rentals represented 70 percent and 79 percent of total revenue for general rentals and trench safety pump and power respectively general rentals equipment rentals increased 93 or 39 percent reflecting a 32 percent increase in samestore rental revenues trench safety pump and power equipment rentals increased 7 or 41 percent reflecting a 17 percent increase in samestore rental revenues as well as increased revenues from cold starts

sales of new equipment  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 sales of new equipment represented approximately 6 percent of our total revenue our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 94 percent of these sales 2007 sales of new equipment of 230 declined 2 or 09 percent from 

  

2006 reflecting volume declines partially offset by price increases 2006 sales of new equipment of 232 increased 27 or 132 percent as compared to 2005 reflecting price increases and a shift in the mix of equipment sold 

sales of contractor supplies  for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 10 percent of our total revenue our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 96 percent of these sales 2007 sales of contractor supplies of 378 declined 7 or 18 percent from 2006 reflecting the initial effect of repositioning this business 2006 sales of contractor supplies of 385 increased 84 or 279 percent as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in the volume of supplies sold

discontinued operation in december 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic control business to hts acquisition inc an entity formed by affiliates of private equity investors wynnchurch capital partners and oak hill special opportunities fund lp in connection with this transaction we recorded an aftertax loss on sale in 2006 of 24 the transaction closed in february 2007 and we received net proceeds of 66 the loss on sale as well as the results of operations of our traffic control business have been reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of income 

fourth quarter 2007 items during the fourth quarter we reduced our reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage by 4 following our annual physical inventory inspections this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation also during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recognized a benefit of 3 reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for selfinsurance reserves this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals excluding depreciation in addition to these matters during the fourth quarter we recognized income of 94 pretax related to the termination of our merger agreement with cerberus as well as net foreign currency transaction gains of 17 pretax both of these matters are discussed further below see other income

segment operating profit  segment operating profit and operating margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

   

general rentals for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 general rentals accounted for 91 percent of our total operating profit this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ revenue contribution over the same period general rentals’ operating margin in 2007 increased 06 percentage points from 2006 primarily resulting from the realization of the initial benefits of costsaving initiatives implemented in 2007 general rentals’ operating margin in 2006 increased 13 percentage points from 2005 as the benefits of higher rental rates were partially offset by increased costs for labor and benefits as well as reduced gross margins on contractor supplies 

trench safety pump and power  operating profit in 2007 declined 1 reflecting slight declines in gross profit on new equipment sales and contractor supplies partially offset by an increase in gross profit on sales of rental equipment operating profit in 2006 increased 11 reflecting a 37 increase in revenues principally related to acquisitions and cold starts 

gross margin  we have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment this is consistent with the marketplace in general and not unique to united rentals gross margins by revenue classification were as follows 

 

 2007 gross margin of 351 percent declined 03 percentage points from 2006 reflecting a 02 percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals a 30 percentage point decline in gross margin on sales of rental equipment and a 26 percentage point decline in gross margin on contractor supplies partially offset by a 27 percentage point improvement in gross margin on service and other revenues the decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects increased rental costs and a 11 percent decline in rental rates partially offset by a 25 percentage point improvement in time utilization the decline in gross margins on sales of rental equipment and contractor supplies reflects pricing pressure as well as a shift in the mix of product sold the increase in margin on service and other revenues reflects increased revenue 

2006 gross margin of 354 percent increased 15 percentage points from 2005 reflecting a 22 percentage point increase in equipment rentals gross margin and a 27 percentage point increase in the sales of rental equipment gross margin partially offset by a 17 percentage point reduction in gross margin on contractor supplies the improved equipment rental margin reflected a 51 percent increase in rental rates partially offset by a 03 percentage point decline in time utilization to 615 percent the improved margin on sales of rental equipment reflects improved pricing and a shift in the mix of equipment sold the reduction in contractor supplies sales gross margin reflects increased costs related to our distribution centers 

selling general and administrative expenses sga  sga expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 was as follows 

 

 sga expense primarily includes sales force compensation information technology costs third party professional fees advertising and marketing expenses management salaries bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 

  

2007 sga expense of 595 declined 18 or 29 percent as compared to 2006 and declined by 09 percentage points as a percentage of revenue this decline reflects a 13 reduction in professional fees related to regulatory matters the initial benefits of our costsaving initiatives reduced incentive compensation costs and a 3 reduction in bad debt expense the benefit associated with these matters was partially offset by severance costs associated with headcount reductions completed in the second half of 2007 the amendment of our former chairman’s service agreement charges associated with the accelerated vesting upon his june 4 2007 retirement of a restricted stock award held by our former chief executive officer as well as normal inflationary increases 

2006 sga expense of 613 increased 108 percent as compared to 2005 and was flat as a percentage of revenue the increase in actual sga costs reflects normal inflationary increases higher selling and insurance costs related to growth in the business and increased professional fees for business improvement initiatives these increases were partially offset by a yearoveryear reduction of 5 in the level of professional fees related to regulatory matters as well as reduced bad debt expense 

nonrental depreciation and amortization for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 was as follows 

 

 nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as ii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as well as customerrelated intangible assets the increases in 2007 and 2006 relate to a higher basis of depreciable assets additionally during the second quarter of 2006 we determined that we had been depreciating certain vehicles on capital lease over a period which exceeded the related contractual lease terms as a result our nonrental depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 includes a charge of 4 to correct depreciation expense recorded since the fourth quarter of 2002 

interest expense net for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 was as follows 

 

 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 21 or 101 percent as compared to 2006 reflecting lower average debt balances and the 9 benefit we recognized related to the marktomarket impact of certain interest rate swaps the decrease also reflects the absence of the charge we incurred in 2006 related to our term loan prepayment and the retirement of subordinated convertible debentures interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 27 or 149 percent as compared to 2005 reflecting the increase in interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt partially offset by lower average debt balances the 2006 increase also reflects a net charge of 6 that we recorded related to our 400 term loan prepayment as well as the retirement of 76 of subordinated convertible debentures the net charge of 6 includes noncash writeoffs of 9 associated with deferred financing costs partially offset by a gain of 3 recognized in conjunction with the termination of certain interest rate caps the term loan prepayment and retirement of subordinated convertible debentures are discussed further below see “liquidity and capital resources” 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 65 and 53 percent of our total debt was floating rate debt respectively as discussed further below see “liquidity and capital resources” in january 2008 we terminated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion had these swaps been terminated as of december 31 2007 approximately 18 percent of our total debt would have been floating rate debt 

  

interest expense subordinated convertible debentures for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 was as follows 

 

 as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary that has issued preferred securities this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was 146 the decline in interest expense subordinated convertible debentures from 2006 to 2007 reflects the retirement of 76 of these subordinated convertible debentures in the second half of 2006 

other income  in april 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the commencement of a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a possible sale of the company in july 2007 we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to be acquired by cerberus in december 2007 following the termination of that merger agreement we received a breakup fee of 100 other income for 2007 includes the income associated with the receipt of the breakup fee net of related transaction costs of 9 

other income for 2007 also includes 17 of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar and our us subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a longterm investment nature exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change prior to 2007 we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity rather than including them in income our results for 2007 include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter of the 17 recognized in 2007 13 relates to 2007 exchange rate movements and 4 relates to prior periods this correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its effect on our current and prior years’ net income cash flows from operations and stockholders’ equity is not material 

income taxes  the following table summarizes our continuing operations provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rate for each respective period 

 

  

 the differences between the effective tax rates of 372 percent 385 percent and 390 percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of 350 percent for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items additionally 2007 includes a benefit associated with the release of state tax valuation allowances partially offset by certain nondeductible compensation expense and prior year state tax matters our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions

liquidity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility as of december 31 2007 we had i 510 of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility ii 300 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of 381 cash equivalents at december 31 2007 consist of high quality low risk treasury securities and do not include any auction rate securities we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next twelve months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or real estate or through the use of additional operating leases additionally if we were to pursue an acquisition recapitalization or other strategy to enhance shareholder value our existing levels of indebtedness may increase and as a result a greater portion of our cash may be required to service any such indebtedness for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2008 will be approximately 715 which represents a decrease of 275 as compared to 2007 we expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment cash generated from operations and if required borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 

term loan prepayment in the third quarter of 2006 we prepaid 400 of our outstanding term loan using 200 of available cash and 200 borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility contemporaneous with this term loan prepayment we terminated a portion of our interest rate caps that were hedging our interest rate exposures on our term loan in the fourth quarter of 2006 we subsequently repaid 175 of the 200 previously borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

retirement of subordinated convertible debentures as previously discussed the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued 6 1 2 percent convertible quarterly income preferred securities “quips” in 2006 we announced the redemption of 76 of quips the redemption price was 1013 percent in conjunction with the redemption we retired 76 of our subordinated convertible debentures this redemption was funded with proceeds from stock option exercises received during 2006 

  

accounts receivable securitization in october 2006 we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization facility the amended facility provides for generally lower borrowing costs and the facility size has been increased from 200 to 300 additionally the maturity date has been extended from may 2009 to october 2011 borrowings under the amended facility will continue to be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

loan covenants and compliance as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our senior secured credit facility the senior notes the quips and our accounts receivables securitization facility any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

we consider our most restrictive covenant to be the minimum interest coverage ratio which is the ratio of our consolidated net income to our interest expense as defined in our senior secured credit facility the minimum amount permitted under this covenant is 165 to 10 and our actual minimum interest coverage ratio for the year ended december 31 2007 was 347 to 10 

sources and uses of cash—continuing operations  during 2007 we i generated cash from operations of 859 including the 100 termination fee we received from cerberus less transaction related costs of 9 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 342 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 990 and ii fund payments on debt net of proceeds received of 71 additionally during 2007 we received net proceeds of 66 related to the sale of our traffic control business during 2006 we i generated cash from operations of 834 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 352 and iii received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 78 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 951 ii fund payments on debt net of proceeds received of 404 and iv retire 76 of subordinated convertible debentures during 2005 we i generated cash from operations of 638 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 315 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 801 ii fund debt repayments and financing costs of 74 and iii purchase other companies net of cash acquired of 40 

our credit ratings as of february 15 2008 were as follows 

 

 both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the noninvestment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 

  

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2007

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 

  

interest rate risk during 2007 and earlier periods we utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion the effect of the swap agreements were at december 31 2007 to convert 12 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i 445 of our 6 1 2 percent notes through 2012 ii 375 of our 7 percent notes through 2014 and iii 375 of our 7 3 4 percent senior subordinated notes through 2013 

as of december 31 2007 after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements we had an aggregate of 17 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates as of december 31 2007 the debt that was subject to fluctuations in interest rates included 140 of borrowings under our canadian revolving facility 12 billion in swaps and 327 of term loans the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2007 were i 65 percent for the revolving credit facility which represents the canadian rate since the amount outstanding was canadian borrowings ii 76 percent for the debt subject to our swap agreements and iii 71 percent for the term loan as of december 31 2007 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements our annual aftertax earnings would decrease by approximately 10 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility additionally in january 2008 we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements and made a payment of 4 had these swaps been terminated as of december 31 2007 we would have had an aggregate of 467 of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2007 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2007 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

industry overview 

based on industry sources we estimate that the us equipment rental industry had total revenues of approximately 33 billion in 2006 this represents a compound annual growth rate of over 10 percent since 1990 

in 2002 and 2003 industry rental revenues decreased by over 10 billion from the level reached in 2001 this decrease reflected significant weakness in private nonresidential construction activity which declined by 132 percent in 2002 and by an additional 51 percent in 2003 according to us department of commerce data department of commerce data has not been adjusted for inflation according to this data private nonresidential construction activity increased 42 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 increased 50 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 162 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 our industry is particularly sensitive to changes in nonresidential construction activity because to date this has been our principal end market for rental equipment 

we believe that longterm industry growth in addition to reflecting general economic expansion is driven by an enduser market that increasingly recognizes the many advantages of renting equipment rather than owning customers recognize that by renting they can 

 

  

   

  

 while the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment industrial companies utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance plant turnarounds and other operations requiring the periodic use of equipment we believe that over the longterm increasing rentals by governmental entities and the industrial sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth 

competitive advantages 

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

large and diverse rental fleet  our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry which allows us to 

 

  

 significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment contractor supplies and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors

geographic and customer diversity  as of january 1 2007 we had 696 rental locations in 48 states ten canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners we believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including i enabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations ii helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across north america iii reducing our dependence on any particular customer and iv reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance

strong and motivated branch management  each of our full service branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager from one of our 88 districts and a vice president from one of our 11 regions we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them within budgetary guidelines to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters each region office has a management team that monitors branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews the compensation of branch managers and certain other branch personnel is linked to their branch’s financial performance and return on assets this provides an incentive for branch personnel to control costs optimize pricing and manage fleet efficiently

used equipment sales  we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs as well as the age composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements and local demand and the age of the fleet

advertising  we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio direct mail and sports sponsorships we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

suppliers 

our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements this approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand we utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors we consider product capabilities and industry position product liability history and financial strength 

we have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 28 percent of our 2006 purchases of equipment for rental or resale and that our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73 percent of such purchases we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories 

  

information technology systems

we have a fully functional backup facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

competition 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to and in anticipation of customer demand for additional information see “– competitive advantages” 

environmental and safety regulations 

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater storm water solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business   dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations under environmental and safety laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance we incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations we do not anticipate these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or earnings

 item 1a risk factors tableend our results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec should any of these risks materialize our business financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 

decreases in north american construction and industrial activities could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge 

our general rental and trench safety pump and power equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities weakness in our end markets such as a decline in construction or industrial activity may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge any such decrease could adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues and gross profit margins to be reduced 

the following factors among others may cause weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

 

  

  

  

  

 our operating results may fluctuate which could affect the trading value of our securities 

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities these factors in addition to general economic conditions include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our substantial debt exposes us to various risks 

at december 31 2006 our total indebtedness was approximately 27 billion including 146 million of subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

 

  

  

 further if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

 

  

  

  

 even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2006 including the effect of our interest rate swap and cap agreements we had approximately 14 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represents approximately 53 percent of our total indebtedness excluding our subordinated convertible debentures see item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are subject to an ongoing inquiry by the sec 

as previously reported the company is the subject of a nonpublic factfinding inquiry by the sec that appears to relate to a broad range of the company’s accounting practices and does not seem to be confined to a specific time period in august 2004 we issued a press release and filed a form 8k disclosing the existence of the sec inquiry in march 2005 our board of directors formed the special committee of independent directors to review matters related to the sec inquiry our board of directors received and acted upon findings of the special committee in january 2006 the actions that we took with respect to the special committee’s findings and actions that we took with respect to certain other accounting matters including the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in our 2005 form 10k 

we are cooperating with the sec in its ongoing inquiry the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry we are also cooperating fully with this office however we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries whether any proceeding relating to them will be brought or when these matters might be resolved these matters have the potential to adversely affect us in a number of ways including the following 

 

  

  

 if we are ultimately required to pay significant amounts andor take significant corrective actions our results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected in addition regardless of the outcome the publicity surrounding the inquiries and the potential risks associated with the inquiries could negatively impact the perception of our company by investors and others which could adversely affect the price of our securities our access to the capital markets andor our borrowing costs 

we are subject to certain ongoing class action lawsuits 

three class action lawsuits have been filed against the company as described in greater detail under item 3 – legal proceedings all three of the complaints allege among other things that i certain of the company’s sec filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements which resulted in damages to the plaintiffs and the members of the purported class when they purchased the company’s securities and ii the conduct in connection therewith violated section 10b of the exchange act sec rule 10b5 and in the case of the individual defendants section 20a of the exchange act the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages costs and expenses 

we intend to defend against these actions vigorously however we do not know what the outcome of these proceedings will be and if we do not prevail we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts further regardless of the outcome we may incur significant defense costs and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from normal business operations if we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs damages or settlement amounts such payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business and our insurance policies may not fully cover them 

we are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business these claims include those relating to i personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us ii motor 

  

vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and iii employment related claims further as described elsewhere in this report several shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us currently we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

 we establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business operations claims or portions thereof not covered by our insurance policies to the extent that we are found liable for any significant claims that exceed our established levels of reserves that cause us to significantly increase such reserves or that are not otherwise covered by insurance our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition our insurance carriers may disclaim some or all of the coverage for the class action and derivative lawsuits against us and our indemnification costs associated with the sec inquiry may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or not available at all 

we have made numerous acquisitions which entail certain risks as do our other growth initiatives 

we have grown in part through acquisitions and expect to continue to do so we will consider potential acquisitions of varying sizes and may on a selective basis pursue acquisitions or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privatelyheld companies it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions 

the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

 we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient to fund future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing and consequently our indebtedness may increase as we implement our growth strategy 

we have also spent considerable time resources and efforts apart from acquisitions in attempting to grow our business operations over the past few years including by building our contractor supplies business these 

  

efforts place and are expected to continue to place strains on our management and other personnel and resources and require timely and continued investment in facilities personnel and financial and management systems and controls we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth initiatives which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 

if we are unable to satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings or we could face other substantial costs 

under the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility we are required to among other things satisfy certain financial tests relating to a the interest coverage ratio b the ratio of funded debt to cash flow c the ratio of senior secured debt to tangible assets and d the ratio of senior secured debt to cash flow if we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants the lenders could elect to terminate our senior secured credit facility andor other agreements governing our debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings in such event unless we were able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace our senior secured credit facility andor the other agreements governing our debt we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and we would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity for our operations in addition to financial covenants we are subject to various other covenants in our senior secured credit facility as well as in the other agreements governing our debt such as a requirement to file our periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner for example when we were not current with our sec periodic reports as a result of our restatement process described above we incurred in excess of 34 million in consent solicitation fees with respect to our public debt indentures in order to address noncompliance with such a covenant 

in addition to the risks with respect to covenant noncompliance compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations for instance these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business 

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment making acquisitions opening new rental locations and refinancing existing indebtedness 

we may not have successfully remediated a previously identified material weakness in our internal controls and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future 

as described below under item 9a we have in the past had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and as of december 31 2005 had a material weakness in our financial close process we have taken actions to remediate all material weaknesses that we previously identified and we believe that we have successfully remediated all material weaknesses including as of december 31 2006 the material weakness in our financial close process however there can be no assurance that we will not identify additional weaknesses in the future additionally even if we believe we have effective control over financial reporting the process for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting requires subjective judgments and the application of standards that are relatively new and subject to questions of interpretation accordingly we cannot 

  

be certain that our independent auditors will agree with our assessment if either we or our auditors ultimately conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective the perception of our company may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect the price of our securities our access to the capital markets andor our borrowing costs 

goodwill related to acquisitions represents a substantial portion of our total assets if the fair value of the goodwill should drop below the recorded value we would be required to writeoff the excess goodwill 

on december 31 2006 we had goodwill of 13 billion on our balance sheet which represented approximately 25 percent of our total assets as of such date this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses of the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at december 31 2006 94 percent is associated with our general rentals segment and 6 percent is associated with our trench safety pump and power segment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to writeoff the excess goodwill as an operating expense our results in 2004 were adversely affected by the writeoff of approximately 139 million of goodwill related to our now discontinued traffic control operations and our results in the preceding two years were also adversely affected by significant goodwill writeoffs based on the current performance of our general rentals and trench safety pump and power segments as well as current market conditions we do not currently anticipate significant goodwill writeoffs however in previous years we recorded significant goodwill writeoffs and we cannot be certain that a future downturn in the business or changes in market conditions will not necessitate additional writeoffs in future periods 

our industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge 

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by among other things decreasing our rental volumes depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees 

disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations 

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions 

we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our operating results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things i the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and ii fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean 

  

and maintain equipment dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

based on conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation andor compliance effort will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated our liquidity and operating results could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs 

labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers andor lead to higher labor costs 

we currently have approximately 800 employees that are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 11200 employees that are not represented by unionsvarious unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages andor slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers in addition these efforts could negatively affect our relationship with certain customers further our labor costs could increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 

fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 

we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet accordingly we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another branch or one region to another region a significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have operations outside the united states as a result we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws 

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include i the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates ii the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations and iii the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries

we have not paid dividends on our common stock since inception however the payment of any future dividends or the authorization of stock repurchases or other recapitalizations will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements restrictions in financing agreements business conditions and other factors the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and the terms of our outstanding preferred stock contain certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in addition under delaware law dividends may only be paid out of capital surplus or current or prior year net profits 

sales of unregistered securities 

options to purchase an aggregate of 210000 shares of the company’s common stock were granted to three employees and consultants between january 1 and april 12 2006 the grant of these options was not required to be registered under the securities act because the issuance did not constitute a sale within the meaning of section 23 thereof

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data and unless otherwise indicated tableend executive overview 

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 696 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors these advantages include greater purchasing power the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 

we offer for rent over 20000 classes of rental equipment including construction equipment industrial and heavy machinery aerial work platforms trench safety equipment and homeowner items our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals sales of rental used equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales and service and other rental equipment revenues have historically accounted for approximately 70 percent of our total revenues and we expect this trend to continue 

in december 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic control business to hts acquisition inc “hts” an entity newlyformed by affiliates of private equity investors wynnchurch capital partners and oak hill special opportunities fund lp in connection with this transaction we recorded an aftertax loss on sale in 2006 of 24 traffic control was previously presented as a separate reporting segment this transaction closed in february 2007 and we received net proceeds of 68 the loss on sale as well as 2006 and prior period results for traffic control have been reflected in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

in august 2004 we received notice from the sec that it was conducting a nonpublic factfinding inquiry of the company the sec inquiry appears to relate to a broad range of the company’s accounting practices and is not confined to a specific period in march 2005 our board of directors formed a special committee to review matters related to the sec inquiry the special committee retained independent counsel the board of directors received and acted upon findings of the special committee in january 2006 the actions that we took with respect to the special committee’s findings including the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in our 2005 form 10k the sec inquiry is ongoing and we are continuing to cooperate fully with the sec the us attorney’s office has also requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry the company is also cooperating fully with this office 

as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in addition to the matters referenced above we are also subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative suits although we have not accrued any amounts related to the ultimate disposition of these matters to date any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred other costs associated with the sec inquiry the us attorney’s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits including reimbursement of attorneys’ fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors are expensed as incurred 

financial overview 

free cash flow gaap reconciliation 

we define “free cash flow” as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and nonrental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and nonrental equipment proceeds from sales of rental locations and proceeds from salesleaseback transactions management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements however free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

 

 in 2006 we reported revenues and free cash flow of 36 billion and 249 respectively our 2006 revenue growth of 107 percent trailed our primary end market private nonresidential construction which grew 162 percent in 2006 according to department of commerce data department of commerce data has not been adjusted for inflation our 107 percent revenue growth reflects increased rental rates of 51 percent and a 19 percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization to 619 percent dollar equipment utilization is calculated by dividing equipment rental revenue by the average original cost of equipment in our rental fleet in addition to generating significant revenue and free cash flow growth in 2006 we also focused on reducing our total debt in 2006 we reduced our total debt including our subordinated convertible debentures by 450 

  

in 2005 we reported revenues and free cash flow of 33 billion and 128 respectively our 2005 revenue growth of 160 percent outpaced our primary end market which grew 50 percent in 2005 according to department of commerce data this growth reflects increased rental rates of 55 percent and a 50 percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization to 600 percent 

we are committed to capitalizing on future growth opportunities our goal is to grow revenues to approximately 385 billion in 2007 we expect organic growth prudent acquisitions and the expansion of complementary revenue streams such as contractor supplies to contribute to this growth 

revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 were as follows 

 

 equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers sales of rental equipment include our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors which include construction consumables tools small equipment and safety supplies services and other includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 

2006 total revenues of 36 billion increased 107 percent compared with total revenues of 33 billion in 2005 the increase primarily reflects an 82 percent increase in equipment rentals and a 279 percent increase in contractor supplies sales the increase in equipment rentals reflects a 51 percent increase in rental rates and a 19 percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering equipment rentals represented 70 percent and 71 percent of our revenues in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

2005 total revenues of 33 billion increased 160 percent compared with total revenues of 28 billion in 2004 the increase primarily reflects a 136 percent increase in equipment rentals and a 490 percent increase in contractor supplies sales the increase in equipment rentals reflects a 55 percent increase in rental rates and a 50 percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering equipment rentals represented 73 percent of our revenues in 2004 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in applying many accounting principles we make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates and judgments although actual results may differ from those estimates we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

  

revenue recognition  we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straightline basis our rental contract periods are daily weekly or monthly by way of example if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars 100 300 and 900 respectively we would recognize revenue of 3214 per day the daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of 900 by 28 days the monthly term as part of this straightline methodology when the equipment is returned we recognize as incremental revenue the excess if any between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect we base our estimate on a combination of an analysis of our accounts receivable on a specific accounts basis and historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

purchase price allocation  we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition with the exception of goodwill longlived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions the longlived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment transportation equipment and real estate with limited exceptions virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as “to be used” rather than as “to be sold” equipment that we acquire and classify as “to be used” is recorded at fair value as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 

in addition to longlived fixed assets we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities these other assets and liabilities typically include but are not limited to parts inventory accounts receivable accounts payable and other working capital items because of their shortterm nature the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets however when appropriate we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill customerrelated intangibles specifically customer relationships and covenants nottocompete goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed customer relationships and noncompete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 

impairment of goodwill  we have made acquisitions in the past that included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill commencing january 1 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently as events occur that indicate a decline in fair value below its carrying value in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to writeoff the excess goodwill as an operating expense 

  

prior to january 1 2004 we tested for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis accordingly a goodwill writeoff was required even if only one or a limited number of our branches had an impairment as of the testing date and even if there was no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis commencing january 1 2004 we began testing for goodwill impairment at a regional rather than a branch level we began testing for impairment at this level because accounting standards require that goodwill impairment testing be performed at the reporting unit level in 2004 following a reorganization of our reporting structure our regions became our reporting units this change in reporting units may impact future goodwill impairment analyses because there are substantially fewer regions than there are branches 

impairment of longlived assets  we review the valuation of our longlived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired if this review indicates the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value the determination of recoverability is based upon an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset’s remaining useful life we make estimates and assumptions when applying the undiscounted cash flow analysis these estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize writedowns on our longlived assets 

income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized in the case of deferred tax assets the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies we generally evaluate projected taxable income for a fiveyear period to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and in addition examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have not provided a valuation allowance related to the federal deferred tax asset associated with our federal net operating loss carryforwards because we believe that it is more likely than not that the full benefit of these amounts will be recovered during the carryforward period we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for certain foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforward amounts these valuation allowances were required because it is more likely than not that some of the foreign tax credit and carryforward amounts will expire unused 

we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions accordingly accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and selfinsured retentions which we sometimes refer to as “selfinsurance” these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and accordingly the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time our methodology for developing selfinsurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries our estimation process considers among other matters the cost of known claims over time cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims further these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

  

legal contingencies  we are involved in a variety of claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings as described elsewhere in this report we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination judgment or settlement occurs

recent accounting pronouncements  see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources  

liquidity  we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services ii the legal requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility as of december 31 2006 we had i 492 of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility ii 275 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of 119 we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months 

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next twelve months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service and v acquisitions we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or real estate or through the use of additional operating leases for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “—certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2007 will range between 900 and 950 we expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment cash generated from operations and if required borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 

while emphasizing internal growth we intend to continue to expand through a disciplined acquisition program we will consider potential transactions of varying sizes and may on a selective basis pursue acquisition or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privatelyheld companies we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient to fund such future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing and consequently our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy 

term loan prepayment in the third quarter of 2006 we prepaid 400 of our outstanding term loan using 200 of available cash and 200 borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility contemporaneous with this term loan prepayment we terminated a portion of our interest rate caps that were hedging our interest rate exposures on our term loan in the fourth quarter of 2006 we subsequently repaid 175 of the 200 previously borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

retirement of subordinated convertible debentures as previously discussed the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has 

  

issued 6 1  2 percent convertible quarterly income preferred securities “quips” in 2006 we announced the redemption of 76 of quips the redemption price was 1013 percent in conjunction with the redemption we retired 76 of our subordinated convertible debentures this redemption was funded with proceeds from stock option exercises received during 2006 

accounts receivable securitization in october 2006 we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization facility the amended facility provides for generally lower borrowing costs and the facility size has been increased from 200 to 300 additionally the maturity date has been extended from may 2009 to october 2011 borrowings under the amended facility will continue to be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

loan covenants and compliance as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our senior secured credit facility the senior notes the quips and our accounts receivables securitization facility any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

we consider our most restrictive covenant to be the minimum interest coverage ratio which is the ratio of our consolidated net income to our interest expense as defined in our senior secured credit facility the minimum amount permitted under this covenant is 165 to 10 and our actual minimum interest coverage ratio for the year ended december 31 2006 was 240 to 10 

sources and uses of cash  during 2006 we i generated cash from operations of 858 ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 356 and iii received proceeds from the exercise of stock option of 78 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 965 ii fund payments on debt net of proceeds received of 404 and iv retire 76 of subordinated convertible debentures during 2005 we i generated cash from operations of 629 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 319 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 823 ii fund debt repayments and financing costs of 74 and iii purchase other companies net of cash acquired of 40 during 2004 we i generated cash from operations of 725 and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and nonrental equipment of 284 we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and nonrental equipment of 649 ii purchase other companies net of cash acquired of 102 and iii fund payments on debt net of proceeds received as well as financing costs of 51 

the consolidated statements of cash flows include the traffic control business for all periods presented and we have not reclassified these cash flows our principal sources and uses of cash for traffic control have related to working capital items and capital expenditures for rental and nonrental equipment additionally in 2005 we agreed to maintain 75 in an investment account for a traffic control subsidiary to conduct traffic control business with the state of florida in march 2006 we signed an agreement with the state of florida whereby we were no longer required to maintain these funds in any type of account other than this commitment traffic control has not significantly impacted our liquidity and capital resources traffic control’s capital expenditures have historically been insignificant to our consolidated results and we do not expect the sale of traffic control to have a material effect on our future cash flows financial position and results of operations we intend to reinvest proceeds received from the sale in our operations 

our credit ratings as of february 20 2007 were as follows 

 

 both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit ratings which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the noninvestment grade segment as long as our ratings reflect a below investment grade rating 

  

certain information concerning contractual obligations  the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december 31 2006

certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements we lease real estate rental equipment and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of some of our equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 8 in accordance with fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2006 or any prior date because the leases associated with such guarantees were entered into prior to january 1 2003

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 

interest rate risk we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2006 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion and cap agreements with an agreement notional amount of 329 the effect of the swap agreements were at december 31 2006 to convert 12 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i 445 of our 6 1  2 percent notes through 2012 ii 375 of our 7 percent notes through 2013 and iii 375 of our 7 3  4 percent senior subordinated notes through 2013 certain of these swaps contain mutual put provisions which allow either party to terminate the swap for the market value of the swap as of certain specified dates between 2007 and 2009 in february 2007 swaps with a notional of 250 were modified and as a result these swaps will be dedesignated as fair value hedges accordingly there may be volatility in our future earnings 

as of december 31 2006 after giving effect to our interest rate swap and cap agreements we had an aggregate of 14 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates for this purpose the portion of the term loan subject to the cap is considered fixed the debt that is subject to fluctuations in interest rates includes 137 of borrowings under our revolving canadian facility 25 of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 12 billion in swaps and 1 of term loans not subject to an interest rate cap the weightedaverage interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december 31 2006 were i 62 percent for the revolving credit facility which represents the canadian rate since the amount outstanding was canadian borrowings ii 54 percent for borrowings outstanding related to the accounts receivable securitization facility iii 81 percent for the debt subject to our swap agreements and iv 74 percent for the term loan as of december 31 2006 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements our annual earnings would decrease by approximately 9 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 

the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility from time to time additionally the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate based on changes in our interest rate swaps and caps portfolio all such derivatives are entered into for hedging as opposed to speculative purposes all of our interest rate cap agreements terminate in june 2007 for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2006 relative to the company as a whole a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings in addition we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our transaction exposures we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2006 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

 item 1   business tableend   

general 

  

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in north america we offer for rent over 600 types of equipment—everything from heavy machines to hand tools—through our network of more than 730 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico our customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and others in 2003 we added 200000 new customers increasing our total customer base to 19 million and generated revenues of approximately 29 billion 

  

our fleet of rental equipment the largest in the world includes over 500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 35 billion the fleet includes 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to renting equipment we sell used rental equipment act as a dealer for new equipment and sell related merchandise and contractor supplies parts and service 

  

industry overview 

  

based on industry sources we estimate that the us equipment rental industry has grown from approximately 66 billion in annual rental revenues in 1990 to about 235 billion in 2003 this represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 103 although in the past two years industry rental revenues decreased by about 13 billion the recent downturn in industry revenues is a reflection of the significant slowdown in private nonresidential construction activity this activity declined 52 in 2003 and 132 in 2002 according to department of commerce data our industry is particularly sensitive to changes in nonresidential construction activity because to date the principal end market for rental equipment has been nonresidential construction when nonresidential construction activity eventually rebounds we would expect to see our industry resume its longterm growth trend 

  

we believe that longterm industry growth in addition to reflecting general economic expansion is driven by an enduser market that increasingly recognizes the many advantages of renting equipment rather than owning customers recognize that by renting they can 

  

   

   

   

   

while the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment industrial companies utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance plant turnarounds and other operations requiring the periodic use of equipment we believe that over the long term increasing rentals by the industrial sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth 

  

competitive advantages 

  

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

  

large and diverse rental fleet our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry which allows us to 

  

   

   

   

significant purchasing power we purchase large amounts of equipment merchandise and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

  

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

  

equipment sharing among branches  we generally group our branches into clusters of 10 to 30 locations that are in the same geographic area each branch within a cluster can access all available equipment in the cluster area this increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches in 2003 the sharing of equipment among branches accounted for approximately 115 or 250 million of our total rental revenue 

  

ability to transfer equipment among branches  the size of our branch network gives us the ability to take advantage of strength at a particular branch or in a particular region by permanently transferring underutilized equipment from weaker to stronger areas 

  

consolidation of common functions  we reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our more than 730 branches such as payroll accounts payable benefits and risk management information technology and credit and collection 

  

stateoftheart information technology systems we have stateoftheart information technology systems that facilitate our ability to make rapid and informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of information technology specialists that supports our systems 

  

strong brand recognition we have strong brand recognition which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty 

  

geographic and customer diversity we have more than 730 branches in 47 states seven canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from fortune 500 companies to small companies and homeowners in 2003 we served more than 19 million customers and our top ten customers accounted for less than 3 of our revenues we believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including 1 enabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations 2 helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across the country 3 reducing our dependence on any particular customer and 4 reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance 

  

national account program our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs we currently serve more than 1700 national account customers as the number of our national account customers has grown our revenues from these customers have increased to 470 million in 2003 from 245 million in 2000 

  

strong and motivated branch management each of our branches has a fulltime branch manager who is supervised by a district manager from one of our 55 districts and a vice president from one of our nine regions we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them—within budgetary guidelines—to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters senior management closely tracks branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews the compensation of branch managers and certain other branch personnel is linked to their branch’s financial performance and return on assets this incentivizes branch personnel to control costs optimize pricing share equipment with other branches and manage fleet efficiently 

  

employee training programs  we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction in 2003 our employees enhanced their skills through 166000 total hours of internal training 

  

risk management and safety programs we believe that we have one of the most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals and is responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures developing our employee and customer training programs and managing any claims against us 

  

products and services 

  

our principal products and services are described below for financial information concerning our foreign and domestic operations see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

equipment rental we offer for rent over 600 different types of equipment on a daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms traffic control equipment trench safety equipment and general tools and light equipment 

  

our fleet of rental equipment is the largest in the world and includes over 500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 35 billion we estimate that each of the following categories accounted for 10 or more of our equipment rental revenues in 2003 i aerial lift equipment approximately 27 ii earth moving equipment approximately 12 and iii forklifts approximately 10 we believe that our fleet is one of the newest and best maintained in the industry the weighted average age of our fleet is approximately 40 months 

  

used equipment sales we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage the age composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements and local demand and the age of the fleet 

  

we principally sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america we also sell used equipment through our website wwwunitedrentalscom which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale 

  

new equipment sales we sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers the manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include genie and jlg aerial lifts multiquip wacker bomag and honda usa compaction equipment generators and pumps sullair compressors skytrak and lull rough terrain reach forklifts thomas and takeuchi skidsteer loaders and miniexcavators and terex offroad dump trucks and telehandlers the type of new equipment that we sell varies by location 

  

related merchandise and contractor supplies parts and other services at most of our branches we sell a variety of supplies and merchandise such as saw blades fasteners drill bits hard hats gloves and other safety equipment we also offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers 

  

in 2002 we launched an initiative to increase merchandise and contractor supplies sales across our network by building on the best practices of our strongest retail locations as part of this continuing initiative we are 1 upgrading merchandise displays 2 adding merchandise sales representatives and 3 offering the merchandise to our customers through our sales force and catalogues in 2003 we experienced growth in merchandise sales of approximately 15 our goal is to grow our merchandise sales by 20 to 30 per year over the next five years 

  

our rentalman ™ software we have a subsidiary that develops and markets software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations the rentalman tm software package developed by this subsidiary is used by many of the largest equipment rental companies 

  

customers 

  

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our largest customer accounted for less than 1 of our revenues in 2003 and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 3 of our revenues in 2003 

  

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch and the business composition of the local economy our customers include 

  

   

   

   

   

sales and marketing 

  

we market our products and services through multiple channels as described below 

  

sales force we have 2443 salespeople including 1143 storebased sales coordinators and 1300 fieldbased salespeople our sales force calls on existing and potential customers and assists our customers in planning for their equipment needs we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction 

  

national account program our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers particularly those with a national or multiregional presence the national account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area our national account team currently includes 35 sales professionals 

  

erental store ™  our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our erental store ®  which is part of our website our customers can also use our ur data ® application to access uptotheminute reports on their business activity with us 

  

advertising we promote our business through local and national advertising in various media including trade publications yellow pages the internet radio and direct mail we also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events 

  

suppliers 

  

we have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19 of our 2003 purchases of equipment for rental or resale and that our top 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64 of such purchases we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for each of our material equipment categories 

  

information technology systems 

  

we have advanced information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our as400 system located at our data center all rental transactions are entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management and branch personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day 

  

these systems 

  

   

   

   

   

our information technology systems and our website are supported by our inhouse group of information technology specialists this group trains our branch personnel upgrades and customizes our systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to assist branch personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the systems to newly acquired locations and manages our website 

  

we have a backup facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

  

competition 

  

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe that in general large companies enjoy significant competitive advantages compared to smaller operators including greater purchasing power a lower cost of capital the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to customer demand for additional information see “—competitive advantages” 

  

environmental and safety regulations 

  

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things 1 the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and 2 fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

  

based on the conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us our operating results could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 

  

employees 

  

we have 12516 employees of these employees 3723 are salaried personnel and 8793 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 84 separate locations cover 1189 of our employees we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory

price range of common stock 

  

our common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “uri” the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange 

  

   

as of march 1 2004 there were approximately 541 holders of record of our common stock we believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our common stock is held of record in broker “street names” 

  

dividend policy 

  

we intend to retain all earnings for the foreseeable future for use in the operation and expansion of our business and accordingly we currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements restrictions in financing agreements business conditions and other factors under the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends on our common stock in addition under delaware law we are prohibited from paying any dividends unless we have capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

general 

  

we are the largest equipment rental company in north america our revenues are divided into three categories 

  

   

   

   

our cost of operations consists primarily of i depreciation costs relating to the rental equipment that we own and lease payments for the rental equipment that we hold under operating leases ii the cost of repairing and maintaining rental equipment iii the cost of the items that we sell including new and used equipment and related parts merchandise and supplies and iv personnel costs occupancy costs and supply costs 

  

we record rental equipment expenditures at cost and depreciate equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful life which ranges from two to ten years after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to 10 of cost 

  

selling general and administrative expenses primarily include sales force compensation bad debt expense advertising and marketing expenses management salaries and clerical and administrative overhead 

  

nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as vehicles computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements ii the amortization of deferred financing costs and iii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as described below effective january 1 2002 we no longer amortize goodwill 

  

we completed acquisitions in each of 2001 2002 and 2003 see note 3 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions we believe that our results for these periods are not directly comparable 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

prior to january 1 2002 we amortized our goodwill over a 40year period in accordance with accounting standards then in effect our goodwill amortization in 2001 amounted to approximately 584 million 

  

effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” issued by the financial accountants standards board “fasb” under this standard we no longer amortize our goodwill over a fixed period instead we are required to periodically review our goodwill for impairment in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an operating expense 

  

this new standard only impacts our goodwill we continue to amortize our other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as of december 31 2003 we had other net intangible assets of approximately 32 million 

  

we completed our initial impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 3489 million 2883 million net of tax the charge associated with the initial impairment analysis is reflected on our statement of operations as a “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” we completed subsequent impairment analyses in the fourth quarter of 2002 and fourth quarter of 2003 and recorded additional noncash impairment charges the additional charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 was approximately 2479 million 1988 million net of tax and the additional charge in the fourth quarter of 2003 was approximately 2969 million 2389 million net of tax these charges are reflected on our statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” 

  

the number of branches at which there was some impairment in 2003 represented approximately 25 of our total branches however a substantial part of the total impairment charge in 2003 approximately 85 reflected impairment at approximately 11 of our total branches 

  

we will be required to review our goodwill for further impairment at least annually we test for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment as of the annual testing date or at any other date when an indicator of impairment may exist and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis in addition we assess impairment solely on the basis of recent historical performance and without reference to expected future performance this means that if the historical data for a branch indicates impairment a goodwill writeoff is required even when we believe that branch’s future performance will be significantly better the fact that we test for impairment on a branchbybranch basis and use only historical financial data in assessing impairment increases the likelihood that we will be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future although we cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future writeoffs future goodwill writeoffs if required may have a material adverse effect on our results 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in applying many accounting principles we need to make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below those of our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates and judgments 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect we make such estimate based upon a combination of an analysis of our accounts receivable on a specific accounts basis and historical writeoff experience our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

  

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to 10 of cost the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

  

impairment of goodwill as described above we must periodically determine whether the fair value of our goodwill is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet see “—goodwill and other intangible assets” we must make estimates and assumptions in evaluating the fair value of goodwill we may 

  

be required to change these estimates and assumptions based on changes in economic conditions changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to record additional impairment charges for goodwill 

  

impairment of longlived assets we review the valuation of our longlived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired if this review indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable then the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value the determination of recoverability is based upon a nondiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset’s remaining useful life we must make estimates and assumptions when applying the nondiscounted cash flow analysis these estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize writedowns on our longlived assets 

  

deferred income taxes we have not provided a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets because we believe such assets will be recovered during the carryforward period if sufficient evidence becomes apparent that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such assets resulting in additional income tax expense 

  

reserves for claims  we are exposed to various claims relating to our business these may include claims relating to i personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us ii motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and service personnel and iii employment related claims we establish reserves for reported claims that are asserted against us and for claims that we believe have been incurred but not reported these reserves reflect our estimate of the amounts that we will be required to pay in connection with these claims net of expected insurance recoveries our estimate of reserves is based upon our judgment as to the probability of losses and our historical payment experience related to claims settlements these estimates may change based on among other things changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims furthermore these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our reserves 

  

restructuring during 2002 and 2001 we recorded reserves in connection with the restructuring plans described below these reserves include estimates pertaining to workforce reduction costs and costs of vacating facilities and related settlements of contractual obligations although we do not anticipate significant changes the actual costs may differ from these estimates and we may be required to record additional expense not previously recorded 

  

restructuring plans in 2001 and 2002 

  

we adopted a restructuring plan in april 2001 and a second restructuring plan in october 2002 as described below these plans were adopted in response to adverse changes in economic conditions and in branch performance in certain of our markets in connection with these plans we recorded a restructuring charge of 289 million in 2001 including a noncash component of approximately 109 million and 283 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 including a noncash component of approximately 25 million 

  

the 2001 plan involved the following principal elements i 31 underperforming branches and five administrative offices were closed or consolidated with other locations ii the reduction of our workforce by 489 through the termination of branch and administrative personnel and iii certain information technology hardware and software was no longer used 

  

the 2002 plan involved the following principal elements i 40 underperforming branches and five administrative offices were closed or consolidated with other locations ii the reduction of our workforce by 412 through the termination of branch and administrative personnel and iii a certain information technology project was abandoned 

  

the aggregate annual revenues from the 40 branches that were eliminated as part of the 2002 restructuring amounted to approximately 80 million the portion of these revenues that we were able to retain was significantly less than we had originally anticipated primarily because continued weakness in our end markets limited the amount of equipment from the closed branches that we were able to redeploy to other branches 

  

the table below provides certain information concerning our restructuring charges for additional information see note 5 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 

  

         

as indicated in the table above the aggregate balance of the 2001 and 2002 charges was 173 million as of december 31 2003 we estimate that approximately 68 million of the remaining 2001 and 2002 charges will be paid by december 31 2004 and approximately 105 million in future periods these payments will not affect our future earnings because the charges associated with these payments have already been recorded in our 2002 or 2001 results we expect to make these payments with cash from our operations 

  

charges related to debt refinancings lease buyouts and notes writeoff 

  

transactions in 2001  we refinanced an aggregate of 16957 million of indebtedness and other obligations in april 2001 in connection with this transaction we recorded the following charges i a pretax charge of 181 million 113 million net of tax that relates to the refinancing of indebtedness and primarily reflects the writeoff of deferred financing fees attributable to the debt that was refinanced and ii a pretax charge of 78 million 52 million net of tax that relates to the refinancing of a synthetic lease when the foregoing charges were originally recorded we recorded the 181 million charge as an extraordinary item and the other charge as other income expense net however upon adoption of sfas no 145 on january 1 2003 we reclassified the 181 charge to other income expense net see “—impact of recently issued accounting standards”

transactions in 2003  during the fourth quarter of 2003 we sold new notes and used the proceeds to redeem 4050 million face amount of previously issued senior subordinated notes and buy out existing equipment leases see “—liquidity and capital resources—recent financing transactions” we recorded a pretax charge of 289 million 171 million net of tax in connection with such redemption of notes and a pretax charge of 951 million 577 million net of tax in connection with such buyout of equipment leases the charge related to the redemption of notes primarily reflects the redemption price premium and the writeoff of previously capitalized financing costs relating to such notes the charge relating to the buyout of equipment leases primarily reflects the excess of the buyout price over the fair value of the equipment purchased early termination fees and the writeoff of previously capitalized financing costs related to such leases all such charges are recorded in other income expense net 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we wroteoff notes receivable that were deemed to be impaired we received these notes as consideration for noncore assets that we disposed of in prior years in connection with these writeoffs we recorded a pretax charge of 111 million 66 million net of tax in other income expense net 

  

expected charges in first quarter of 2004 

  

during the first quarter of 2004 we refinanced approximately 21 billion of our debt see “—liquidity and capital resources—recent financing transactions” in connection with the foregoing we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in 2004 of approximately 175 million to approximately 185 million attributable to i the redemption premium for notes redeemed as part of the refinancing and ii the writeoff of previously capitalized costs relating to the debt refinanced these charges will be recorded in other income expense net 

  

we incurred a pretax noncash charge of approximately 70 million in the first quarter of 2004 due to the vesting of restricted shares granted to senior executives in 2001 this charge represents the unamortized portion of the deferred compensation charge associated with the award of such shares 

  

results of operations 

  

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” results and adjusted results 

  

we had a net loss in 2003 of 2586 million compared with a net loss of 3978 million for 2002 the loss in 2003 reflects 3305 million of charges net of tax relating to goodwill impairment buyout of equipment leases debt refinancing notes receivable writeoff and vesting of restricted shares granted to executives in 2001 the loss in 2002 reflects 5054 million of charges net of tax relating to goodwill impairment restructuring costs debt refinancing and a change in accounting principle relating to goodwill 

  

excluding the charges described above for each period we would have had adjusted net income in 2003 of 718 million compared with adjusted net income of 1076 million in 2002 we provide this adjusted data because we believe that this data may be useful to investors in analyzing the periodtoperiod changes in our results that are due to changes in business conditions and that are not due to the writeoff of goodwill or other assets the table below reconciles the adjusted results with our results in accordance with gaap 

  

   

overview of 2003 as adjusted results 

  

our rental rates increased 21 in 2003 and samestore rental revenues increased 37 the rate increases primarily occurred in the second half of the year as rental rates in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2003 increased 34 and 56 respectively on a yearoveryear basis the increase in samestore rental revenues was partially offset by revenues lost due to branch closings and a reduction in the size of our rental fleet the net effect was that our total revenues for the year increased by 16 to 287 billion 

  

our ability to increase revenues was constrained by continued weakness in our principal end markets according to department of commerce data private nonresidential construction activity declined 52 in 2003 following a decline of 132 in 2002 in addition government spending on road and highway construction remained sluggish 

  

the 16 increase in our revenues in 2003 was more than offset by a 44 increase in our cost of revenues this increase was attributable to higher costs in several categories including insurance and claims fleet repair and maintenance fuel and delivery and depreciation of rental equipment the increase in cost of revenues and in particular the cost of rental revenues resulted in gross profits decreasing to 8480 million or 296 of revenues in 2003 from 8863 million or 314 of revenues in 2002 

  

we also had increases in nonrental depreciation and amortization and interest expense of 100 million and 98 million respectively the increase in nonrental depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to upgrades to our delivery fleet and facilities the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the additional interest expense attributable to the senior notes we issued in december 2002 and april 2003 as described below in the first quarter of 2004 we refinanced these senior notes with lower interest rate notes 

  

the cost increases described above net of taxes were the primary reason that income as adjusted in 2003 decreased to 718 million from income as adjusted of 1076 million in 2002 

  

years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

revenues  we had total revenues of 28672 million in 2003 representing an increase of 16 from total revenues of 28210 million in 2002 the different components of our revenues are discussed below

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our revenues from “sale of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” were 5085 million in 2003 representing an increase of 37 from 4901 million in 2002 these revenues accounted for 177 of our total revenues in 2003 compared with 174 of our total revenues in 2002 the increase in these revenues in 2003 principally reflected an increase in the volume of merchandise and contractor supplies sold partially offset by a decrease in sales of new equipment 

  

gross profit gross profit decreased to 8480 million in 2003 from 8863 million in 2002 this decrease primarily reflected the decrease in gross profit margin described below from equipment rentals information concerning our gross profit margin by source of revenue is set forth below 

  

1 equipment rentals our gross profit margin from equipment rental revenues was 300 in 2003 and 321 in 2002 the decrease in 2003 principally reflected cost increases and the decrease in traffic equipment rentals described above the cost increases were attributable to several factors including i higher costs for insurance and claims fleet repair and maintenance and fuel and delivery and ii an increase in depreciation expense 

  

2 sales of rental equipment our gross profit margin from sales of rental equipment was 327 in 2003 and 337 in 2002 the decrease in 2003 primarily reflected a change in the mix of types of equipments sold 

  

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our gross profit margin from “sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” was 268 in 2003 and 276 in 2002 the decrease in gross profit margin in 2003 primarily reflected a change in the mix of types of new equipment sold and to a lesser extent the mix of types of merchandise and contractor supplies sold 

  

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” were 4513 million or 157 of total revenues during 2003 and 4389 million or 156 of total revenues during 2002 the increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to the accelerated vesting of restricted shares granted in 2001 

  

goodwill impairment  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2969 million in 2003 and 2479 million in 2002 see “—goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

  

restructuring charge  we recorded a restructuring charge of 283 million in 2002 see “—restructuring plans in 2002 and 2001” for additional information 

  

nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and amortization was 693 million or 24 of total revenues in 2003 and 593 million or 21 of total revenues in 2002 the increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to an upgrade in transportation equipment and an increase in leasehold improvements in connection with branch upgrades 

  

operating income we recorded operating income of 304 million in 2003 compared with operating income of 1119 million in 2002 the principal reasons for the decrease in 2003 were the decline in gross profit the higher goodwill impairment charge and the higher nonrental depreciation and amortization described above 

  

interest expense  interest expense increased to 2093 million in 2003 from 1960 million in 2002 this increase primarily reflected higher interest costs related to the senior notes we issued in december 2002 and april 2003 partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable rate debt as described below in the first quarter of 2004 we refinanced these senior notes with lower interest rate notes 

  

preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust  preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust were 146 million during 2003 as compared to 182 million during 2002 the decrease in 2003 reflects our repurchase of a portion of our outstanding trust preferred securities primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

other income expense  other expense was 1331 million in 2003 compared with other income of 09 million in 2002 the other expense in 2003 primarily reflects the charges described under “—charges related to debt refinancings lease buyouts and notes writeoff” excluding these charges other income would have been 21 million in 2003 primarily reflecting gains related to the sale of nonrental assets the other income in 2002 was primarily attributable to the favorable settlement of a lawsuit for net proceeds of 40 million partially offset by other expenses including the writeoff of 16 million of deferred financing fees described under “—charges related to debt refinancings lease buyouts and notes writeoff” 

  

income taxes  income taxes were a benefit of 679 million in 2003 compared with a provision of 81 million in 2002 the effective tax rate during the two periods are not comparable because i a portion of the goodwill impairment charge in each such period was not deductible for income tax purposes ii certain expenses in 2003 associated with the amortization of deferred compensation expense attributable to restricted stock awards were not deductible for income tax purposes and iii the 2003 rate was impacted by the charges relating to the buyout of equipment leases debt refinancing and notes receivables writeoff and the 2002 rate was impacted by restructuring costs and charges associated with debt refinancing excluding the foregoing expenses and charges our effective tax rate would have been approximately 39 in 2003 and 2002 

  

loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we had a loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 2586 million in 2003 compared with a loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 1095 million in 2002 the higher loss in 2003 principally reflects the decrease in operating income and the charges reflected in other expense described above

selling general and administrative expenses  sga was 4389 million or 156 of total revenues during 2002 and 4418 million or 153 of total revenues during 2001 our bad debt expense which is a component of sga was approximately 95 million higher in 2002 than in 2001 primarily reflecting an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts without this increase in bad debt expense our sga as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to 152 of total revenues in 2002 from 156 in 2001 this 

  

decrease in sga excluding the change in bad debt expense primarily reflected our ongoing efforts at cutting costs including reducing the number of administrative personnel reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and collection facilities

nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and amortization was 593 million or 21 of total revenues in 2002 and 1068 million or 37 of total revenues in 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to a new accounting standard discussed above under “—goodwill and other intangible assets” which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective january 1 2002 if goodwill amortization had been eliminated in 2001 then nonrental depreciation and amortization would have been 485 million or 17 of total revenues in 2001 the increase in nonrental depreciation and amortization in 2002 as compared to the amount in 2001 after eliminating goodwill amortization primarily reflected an increase in our nonrental assets such as facilities and transportation equipment 

  

operating income we recorded operating income of 1119 million in 2002 compared with operating income of 4620 million in 2001 the principal reason for the decrease in 2002 was the 2479 million noncash goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in 2002 however after excluding that charge our operating income was still lower by approximately 1022 million from the 2001 level the principal reason for this decrease was the declines in revenues and gross profit described above the adverse effects of these factors were partially offset by the decrease in nonrental depreciation and amortization described above

certain balance sheet changes 

  

the increase in rental equipment at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 was primarily attributable to the buyout of equipment leases in 2003 the decrease in goodwill at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 was attributable to the goodwill impairment recognized in 2003 as further described under “—goodwill and other intangible assets” the increase in debt at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 was primarily attributable to the debt refinancings in the fourth quarter of 2003 as further described under “—liquidity and capital resourcesrecent financing transactions” the increase in subordinated convertible debentures and corresponding decrease in companyobligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 was due to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary trust as further described under “—impact of recently issued accounting standards” the decrease in retained earnings and stockholders’ equity at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 primarily reflects our net loss in 2003 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

during 2003 we i generated cash from operations of 3423 million ii generated cash from the sale of rental equipment of 1813 million and iii obtained cash from borrowings net of repayments and financing costs of approximately 2574 million our cash flow from operations during 2003 was reduced by 883 million of cash charges related to our buyout of equipment leases we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental equipment of 3359 million ii buyout equipment leases of 3354 million excluding the 883 million charge relating thereto described above and iii purchase other property and equipment of 420 million 

  

cash requirements related to operations 

  

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility as of march 1 2004 we had 5166 million of borrowing capacity available under our 650 million revolving credit facility reflecting outstanding loans of approximately 921 million and outstanding letters of credit in the amount of approximately 413 million we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

  

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service and v costs relating to our restructuring plans we plan to fund such cash requirements relating to our existing operations from our existing sources of cash described above in addition we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or through the use of additional operating leases for information on the scheduled principal payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “—certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

  

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects based on current conditions we estimate that capital expenditures for the year 2004 will be approximately 575 million to 700 million for our existing operations these expenditures are comprised of approximately i 425 million to 450 million of expenditures to replace rental equipment sold ii 100 million to 200 million of discretionary expenditures to increase the size of our rental fleet and iii 50 million of expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment we expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of used equipment cash generated from operations and if required borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility 

  

while emphasizing internal growth we may also continue to expand through a disciplined acquisition program we will consider potential transactions of varying size and may on a selective basis pursue acquisition or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privatelyheld companies we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient to fund such future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing and consequently our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy 

  

certain information concerning contractual obligations 

  

the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations the information is as of december 31 2003 as adjusted to give effect to the 21 billion refinancing that we completed in the first quarter of 2004 as described under “—liquidity and capital resources—recent financing transactions” 

  

     

certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

restricted stock we have granted to employees other than executive officers and directors approximately 1200000 shares of restricted stock that contain the following provisions the shares vest in 2004 2005 or 2006 or earlier upon a change in control of the company death disability retirement or certain terminations of 

  

employment and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting on certain other terminations of employment the violation of noncompete provisions and certain other events if a holder of restricted stock sells his stock and receives sales proceeds that are less than a specified guaranteed amount set forth in the grant instrument we have agreed to pay the holder the shortfall between the amount received and such specified amount however the foregoing only applies to sales that are made within five trading days of the vesting date the specified guaranteed amount is i 1517 per share with respect to approximately 500000 shares scheduled to vest in 2004 ii 2726 per share with respect to approximately 300000 shares scheduled to vest in 2005 and iii 918 per share with respect to approximately 400000 shares scheduled to vest in 2006 

  

operating leases we lease real estate rental equipment and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of many of our equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value the use of these guarantees helps to lower our monthly operating lease payments we do not know at this time the extent to which the actual residual values may be less than the guaranteed residual values and accordingly cannot quantify the amount that we ultimately will be required to pay if any under these guarantees however under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees in the future if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately 365 million this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december 31 2003 or any prior date for additional information concerning lease payment obligations under our operating leases see “—certain information concerning contractual obligations” above 

  

certain information concerning subordinated convertible debentures 

  

in august 1998 a subsidiary trust of united rentals inc sold six million shares of 6½ convertible quarterly income preferred securities “trust preferred securities” for aggregate consideration of 300 million the trust used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities to purchase 6 1  2  subordinated convertible debentures due 2028 from holdings which resulted in holdings receiving all of the net proceeds of the sale upon the adoption as of december 31 2003 of a recently issued accounting standard we deconsolidated the subsidiary trust that had issued the trust preferred securities as a result of such deconsolidation i the trust preferred securities were removed from our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 and ii the subordinated convertible debentures that we issued to the subsidiary trust which previously had been eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets were no longer eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 however the subordinated convertible debentures are reflected as a component of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 whereas the trust preferred securities were reflected as a separate category prior to december 31 2003 see “—impact of recently issued accounting standards” and note 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report during 2003 the trust repurchased 100000 of these shares for aggregate consideration of approximately 36 million which represents a discount of approximately 29 relative to the aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 50 million during 2002 the trust repurchased 1469000 of these shares for aggregate consideration of approximately 381 million which represents a discount of approximately 48 relative to the aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 735 million 

  

relationship between holdings and uri 

  

united rentals inc “holdings” is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary united rentals north america inc “uri” and subsidiaries of uri holdings provides certain services to uri in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance and tax related services and support iii information technology systems and support iv acquisition related services v legal services and vi human resource support in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by uri and its subsidiaries uri has made and expects to continue to make certain payments to holdings in respect of the services provided by holdings to uri the expenses relating to uri’s payments to holdings are reflected on uri’s financial statements as selling general and administrative expenses in addition although not legally 

  

obligated to do so uri has in the past made and expects that it will in the future make distributions to holdings to among other things enable holdings to pay interest on the convertible debentures that were issued to a subsidiary trust of holdings as described above 

  

the trust preferred securities are the obligation of a subsidiary trust of holdings and are not the obligation of uri historically the dividends payable on these securities were reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of holdings but were not reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of uri this is the principal reason for the difference in the historical net income loss reported on the consolidated financial statements of uri and the net income loss reported on the consolidated financial statements of holdings 

  

fluctuations in operating results 

  

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term certain of the general factors that may cause such fluctuations are discussed under “—factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forward looking statements—fluctuations of operating results” 

  

accounting for certain expenses relating to potential acquisitions 

  

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize certain direct outofpocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions indirect acquisition costs such as executive salaries general corporate overhead public affairs and other corporate services are expensed as incurred our policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that we determine will not be consummated there can be no assurance that in future periods we will not be required to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy which charge depending upon the magnitude thereof could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months the seasonality of our business is heightened because we offer for rent traffic control equipment branches that rent a significant amount of this type of equipment tend to generate most of their revenues and profits in the second and third quarters of the year slow down during the fourth quarter and operate at a loss during the first quarter 

  

inflation 

  

although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations we believe that inflation has not had and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have a material impact on our results of operations however as described above cost increases have from time to time impacted our results 

  

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this standard rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and an amendment of that statement sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” this standard also rescinds sfas no 44 “accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers” this standard amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and certain lease modifications this standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we adopted this standard on january 1 2003 and reclassified a pretax extraordinary loss of approximately 181 

  

million recognized during the second quarter of 2001 to operating income the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 145 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” this standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” but does not require us to use the fair value method this standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stockbased employee compensation we adopted the disclosure portion of this standard as of december 31 2002 and such adoption is reflected in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” revised december 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities “vies” fin 46 requires a vie to be consolidated by a parent company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both a vie is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 for entities created prior to february 1 2003 the effective date of these requirements which originally was july 1 2003 had been deferred so as not to apply until the first period ending after december 15 2003 upon adoption of this standard as of december 31 2003 we deconsolidated a subsidiary trust that had issued trust preferred securities as described above as a result of such deconsolidation i the trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary trust which had previously been reflected on our consolidated balance sheets were removed from our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 and ii the subordinated convertible debentures that we issued to the subsidiary trust which previously had been eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets were no longer eliminated in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 the carrying amount of the trust preferred securities removed from the consolidated balance sheets was the same as the carrying amount of the subordinated convertible debentures added to the consolidated balance sheets however the subordinated convertible debentures are reflected as a component of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 whereas the trust preferred securities were reflected as a separate category prior to december 31 2003 see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the adoption of this standard did not otherwise have a material effect on our statements of financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” this standard amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” this standard is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 except as stated below and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the provisions of this standard that relate to sfas no 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june 15 2003 should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates the adoption of this standard regarding the provisions effective after june 30 2003 did not have a material effect on our statements of financial position or operations 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity this standard requires that financial instruments falling within the scope of this standard be classified as liabilities this standard is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective with the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our statements of financial position or results of operations 

  

factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements 

  

sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities 

  

our general rental equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities and our traffic control equipment is principally used in connection with the construction or repair of roads and bridges and similar infrastructure projects weakness in our end markets such as a decline in construction or industrial activity or a reduction in infrastructure projects may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge any such decrease could adversely affect our operating results by decreasing revenues and gross profit margins for example there have been significant declines in nonresidential construction activity in 2002 and 2003 and reductions in government spending on infrastructure projects in several key states this weakness in our end markets adversely affected our results in 2002 and 2003 as described above 

  

we have identified below certain factors that may cause further weakness in our end markets either temporarily or longterm 

  

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations of operating results 

  

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

substantial goodwill 

  

at december 31 2003 we had on our balance sheet net goodwill in the amount of 14378 million which represented approximately 30 of our total assets at such date this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense any writeoff would reduce our total assets and shareholders’ equity and be a charge against income 

  

we test for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment as of the annual date of testing or at any other date when an indicator of impairment may exist and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis in addition we assess impairment solely on the basis of recent historical performance and without reference to expected future performance this means that if the historical data for a branch indicates impairment a goodwill writeoff is required even when we believe that branch’s future performance will be significantly better the fact that we test for impairment on a branchbybranch basis and use only historical financial data in assessing impairment increases the likelihood that we will be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future 

  

substantial indebtedness 

  

at december 31 2003 our total indebtedness was approximately 30386 million which includes 2216 million in subordinated convertible debentures our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

  

   

   

   

furthermore if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our business we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our business 

  

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2003 as adjusted to give effect to the 21 billion refinancing that we completed in the first quarter of 2004 as described under “—liquidity and capital resources—recent financing transactions” and taking into account our interest rate swap agreements we had 20424 million of variable rate indebtedness 

  

need to satisfy financial and other covenants in debt agreements 

  

under the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility we are required to among other things satisfy certain financial tests relating to a the interest coverage ratio b the ratio of funded debt to cash flow c the ratio of senior secured debt to tangible assets and d the ratio of senior secured debt to cash flow if we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the credit facility and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the credit facility we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above even if we adopt an alternative strategy the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity for our business 

  

we are also subject to various other covenants under the agreements governing our credit facility and other indebtedness these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

  

dependence on additional capital 

  

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing however we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment making acquisitions opening new rental locations and refinancing existing indebtedness 

  

certain risks relating to acquisitions 

  

we have grown in part through acquisitions and may continue to do so we will consider potential acquisitions of varying sizes and may on a selective basis pursue acquisitions or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privatelyheld companies we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient to fund future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing and consequently our indebtedness may increase as we implement our growth strategy the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

  

   

   

   

it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be harmed as a result of acquisitions 

  

dependence on management 

  

our success is highly dependent on the experience and skills of our senior management team if we lose the services of any member of this team and are unable to find a suitable replacement we may not have the depth of senior management resources required to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy we do not maintain “key man” life insurance on the lives of members of senior management 

  

competition 

  

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our rental volumes or depressing the prices that we can charge 

  

dependence on information technology systems 

  

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions 

  

liability and insurance 

  

we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business these possible claims include those relating to 1 personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us 2 motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and service personnel and 3 employment related claims we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

if we are found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by insurance our operating results could be adversely affected because our expenses related to claims would increase it is possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all 

  

environmental and safety regulations 

  

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things 1 the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and 2 fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

  

based on the conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or 

  

environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us our operating results could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 

  

labor matters 

  

we have 1189 employees that are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements if we should experience a prolonged labor dispute involving a significant number of our employees our ability to serve our customers could be adversely affected furthermore our labor costs could increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes 

  

age of our fleet 

  

in determining the optimal age for our fleet we have made estimates concerning the relationship between the age of our fleet and required maintenance costs if our estimates are wrong our operating results could be adversely affected because our maintenance expenses may be higher than anticipated 

  

operations outside the united states 

  

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include 1 the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 2 the need to comply with foreign laws and 3 the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries 

  

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of 1 interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and 2 foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 

  

interest rate risk we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2003 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 1160 million the effect of these agreements was to convert 1160 million of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i 300 million of our 9 1  4  senior subordinated notes through 2009 ii 210 million of our december 2002 issued 10 3  4  senior notes through 2008 iii 200 million of our april 2003 issued 10 3  4  senior notes through 2008 iv 200 million of our 9 senior subordinated notes through 2009 and v 250 million of our 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes through 2013 at december 31 2002 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 500 million the effect of some of these agreements was to limit the interest rate exposure to 95 on 200 million of our then outstanding term loan the effect of the remainder of these agreements was to convert 300 million of our fixed rate 9 1  4  notes to a floating rate instrument through 2009 

  

subsequent to december 31 2003 we refinanced a significant portion of our indebtedness as described under “—liquidity and capital resources—recent financing transactions” in connection with this refinancing we terminated certain of the swap agreements described above and entered into certain new swap agreements as of march 1 2004 we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 1145 million the effect of these agreements is to convert 1145 million of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments the fixed rate notes converted consist of i 245 million of our 6 1  2  senior notes through 2012 ii 525 million of our 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes through 2013 and iii 375 million of our 7 senior subordinated notes through 2014 

  

as of march 1 2004 after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements we had an aggregate of 17871 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this debt includes in addition to the 11450 million of debt subject to the swap agreements described above i all borrowings under our 

  

650 million revolving credit facility 921 million outstanding as of march 1 2004 ii our term loan 5500 million outstanding as of march 1 2004 and iii all borrowings under our 250 million accounts receivable securitization facility none outstanding as of march 1 2004 the weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on march 1 2004 were i 46 for the revolving credit facility represents the canadian rate since the amount outstanding was canadian borrowings ii 34 for the term loan and iii 39 for the debt subject to our swap agreements as of march 1 2004 based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements our annual earnings would decrease by approximately 109 million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility from time to time for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 9 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

currency exchange risk the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2003 relative to the company as a whole a 10 change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings in addition we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our transaction exposures we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” all derivatives are required to be recorded as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are recognized immediately or deferred depending on the use of the derivative and whether or not it qualifies as a hedge derivative financial instruments are periodically used by the company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes

assets and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries operating outside the united states which account in a functional currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars using exchange rates at the end of the year revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective during the year foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders’ equity 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the immediate to shortterm maturity of these financial instruments the fair values of the revolving credit facility term loan and receivables securitization are determined using current interest rates for similar instruments as of december 31 2003 and 2002 and approximate the carrying value of these financial instruments due to the fact that the underlying instruments

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

include provisions to adjust interest rates to approximate fair market value the estimated fair value of the company’s other financial instruments at december 31 2003 and 2002 are based upon available market information and are as follows 

  

   

preferred stock 

  

the company issued series a perpetual convertible preferred stock “series a preferred” and series b perpetual convertible preferred stock “series b preferred” in 1999 and included such preferred stock in stockholders’ equity in july 2001 the sec issued guidance to all public companies as to when redeemable preferred stock may be classified as stockholders’ equity this guidance indicates that preferred stock that would be subject to redemption on the occurrence of an event outside the control of the issuer may not be classified as equity and that the probability of the event occurring is not a factor to be considered under this guidance the series a preferred and series b preferred would not be included in stockholders’ equity because this stock would be subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control on september 28 2001 the company entered into an agreement effecting the exchange of new series c perpetual convertible preferred stock “series c preferred” for the series a preferred and new series d perpetual convertible preferred stock “series d preferred” for the series b preferred see note 12 the series c preferred and series d preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control and is classified as stockholders’ equity under the sec guidance 

  

the effect of the foregoing is that the company’s perpetual convertible preferred stock is classified as stockholders’ equity as of september 28 2001 and thereafter but is classified outside of stockholders’ equity for earlier dates accordingly the company has restated the 2000 balance sheet to show its 4308 million of perpetual convertible preferred stock under “series a and b preferred stock” rather than under “stockholders’ equity” the company has also made a corresponding change to the related consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity in all other respects the financial statements remain unchanged including total assets and liabilities revenues operating income net income and earnings per share

revenue related to the sale of equipment and merchandise is recognized at the time of delivery to or pickup by the customer revenue related to equipment rental is recognized over the contract term

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not realized in future periods 

  

use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes significant estimates include restructuring charges allowance for doubtful accounts useful lives for depreciation goodwill and other asset impairments deferred income taxes claim reserves loss contingencies and fair values of financial instruments actual results could materially differ from those estimates 

  

concentrations of credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and accounts receivable the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the company’s customer base the company’s largest customer in 2003 represented less than 1 of total revenues and no single customer represented greater than 1 of total accounts receivable the company controls credit risk through credit approvals credit limits and monitoring procedures 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

the company accounts for its stockbased compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” at december 31 2003 the company had six stockbased compensation plans see note 13 since stock options are granted by the company with exercise prices at or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant no compensation expense is recognized restricted stock awards granted by the company are recognized as deferred compensation the company recognizes compensation expense related to these restricted stock awards over their vesting periods or earlier upon acceleration of vesting during 2003 the company recognized increased amortization for the accelerated vesting of approximately 866000 shares of restricted stock the following table provides additional information related to the company’s stockbased compensation arrangements for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

the weighted average fair value of options granted was 547 557 and 734 during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model which uses subjective assumptions which can materially affect fair value estimates and therefore does not necessarily provide a single measure of fair value of options the company used a riskfree interest rate average of 181 201 and 374 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively a volatility factor for the market price of the company’s common stock of 63 66 and 49 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and a weightedaverage expected life of options of approximately three years in 2003 2002 and 2001 for purposes of these pro forma disclosures the estimated fair value of options is amortized over the options’ vesting period since the number of options granted and their fair value may vary significantly from year to year the pro forma compensation expense in future years may be materially different 

  

insurance 

  

the company is insured for general liability automobile liability workers’ compensation and group medical claims up to a specified claim and aggregate amounts subject to deductibles per occurrence of 2 million for general liability 2 million for workers’ compensation and 3 million for automobile liability insured losses subject to this deductible are accrued based upon the aggregate liability for reported claims incurred and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported these liabilities are not discounted 

  

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this standard rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and an amendment of that statement sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” this standard also rescinds sfas no 44 “accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers” this standard amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and certain lease modifications this standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions the company adopted this standard on january 1 2003 and reclassified a pretax extraordinary loss of approximately 181 million recognized during the second quarter of 2001 to operating income the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 145 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” this standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” but does not require the company to use the fair value method this standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stockbased employee compensation the company adopted the disclosure portion of this standard as of december 31 2002 and such adoption is reflected within this note 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” revised december 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities “vies” fin 46 requires a vie to be consolidated by a parent company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both a vie is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately to

vies created after january 31 2003 for entities created prior to february 1 2003 the effective date of these requirements which originally was july 1 2003 had been deferred so as not to apply until the first period ending after december 15 2003 upon adoption of this standard as of december 31 2003 the company deconsolidated a subsidiary trust that had issued convertible preferred securities as a result of such deconsolidation i the companyobligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust which had previously been reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheets were removed from its consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 and ii the subordinated convertible debentures that were issued to the subsidiary trust which previously had been eliminated in the company’s consolidated balance sheets were no longer eliminated in its consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 the carrying amount of the convertible preferred securities removed from the consolidated balance sheets was the same as the carrying amount of the subordinated convertible debentures added to the consolidated balance sheets however the subordinated convertible debentures are reflected as a component of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 whereas the convertible preferred securities were reflected as a separate category prior to december 31 2003 see note 11 the adoption of this standard did not otherwise have a material effect on the company’s statements of financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” this standard amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” this standard is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 except as stated below and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the provisions of this standard that relate to sfas no 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june 15 2003 should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates the adoption of this standard regarding the provisions effective after june 30 2003 did not have a material effect on the company’s statements of financial position or operations

3 acquisitions 

  

the acquisitions completed during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 include 1 2 and 3 acquisitions respectively that were accounted for as purchases the results of operations of the businesses acquired in these acquisitions have been included in the company’s results of operations from their respective acquisition dates the acquisition made in 2003 was insignificant to the company’s operations 

  

on june 30 2002 the company acquired 35 rental locations from national equipment services inc for initial consideration of approximately 1116 million in cash which was determined based primarily on the number of locations acquired and their financial performance the acquisition of these rental locations which offer trench safety equipment rental was made to complement the company’s existing network of rental locations the results of operations of the acquisitions are included in the company’s statement of operations as

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

of the date of acquisition the initial consideration paid by the company for the other 2002 acquisition was approximately 459 million in cash the company estimates that approximately 931 million of goodwill related to the 2002 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes 

  

the aggregate initial consideration paid by the company for 2001 acquisitions that were accounted for as purchases was approximately 121 million and consisted of approximately 115 million in cash and 06 million in seller notes in addition the company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate amount of approximately 49 million 

  

the purchase prices for all acquisitions accounted for as purchases have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at their respective acquisition dates purchase price allocations are subject to change when additional information concerning asset and liability valuations are completed the preliminary purchase price allocations that are subject to change primarily consist of rental and nonrental equipment valuations these allocations are finalized within 12 months of the acquisition date and are not expected to result in significant differences between the preliminary and final allocations 

  

the following table summarizes on an unaudited pro forma basis the combined results of operations of the company for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 as though each acquisition described above was made on january 1 2001 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the unaudited pro forma results are based upon certain assumptions and estimates which are subject to change these results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that might have occurred nor are they necessarily indicative of expected results in the future 

  

the acquisition made in 2003 had an insignificant impact on the company’s pro forma results of operations for the year ended december 31 2003 therefore pro forma results of operations for such year is not shown 

  

4 goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

changes in the company’s carrying amount of goodwill for 2003 are as follows in thousands 

  

   

the company adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” issued by the financial accountants standards board “fasb” under this standard goodwill which was previously amortized over 40 

  

united rentals inc 

  

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

years is no longer amortized the company amortized approximately 584 million of goodwill in 2001 the company’s approximately 32 million of other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives the company is required to periodically review its goodwill for impairment in general this means that the company must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on its balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value the company is required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense 

  

the company completed its initial impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 3489 million 2883 million net of tax the charge associated with the initial impairment analysis is reflected on the company’s statement of operations as a “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” the company completed subsequent impairment analyses in the fourth quarter of 2002 and fourth quarter of 2003 and recorded additional noncash impairment charges the additional charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 was approximately 2479 million 1988 million net of tax and the additional charge in the fourth quarter of 2003 was approximately 2969 million 2389 million net of tax these charges are reflected on the company’s statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” 

  

the impairment charges recognized in 2003 and 2002 related to certain branches that decreased in value the factors that negatively affected the value of these branches included the following i continued weakness in nonresidential construction spending which negatively affected the earnings of the company’s branches and ii to a lesser extent operational weakness at some branches and increased competition for some branches fair values used in impairment testing were based upon valuation techniques using multiples of earnings and revenues 

  

the company is required to review its goodwill for further impairment at least annually the company tests for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of the company’s branches has impairment as of the annual testing date or at any other date when an indicator of impairment may exist and even if there is no impairment for all the company’s branches on an aggregate basis in addition the company assesses impairment solely on the basis of recent historical performance and without reference to expected future performance this means that if the historical data for a branch indicates impairment a goodwill writeoff is required even when the company believes that branch’s future performance will be significantly better the fact that the company tests for impairment on a branchbybranch basis and uses only historical financial data in assessing impairment increases the likelihood that the company will be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future although it cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future writeoffs future goodwill writeoffs if required may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world we offer for rent over 600 types of equipment—everything from heavy machines to hand tools—through our network of more than 750 rental locations in the united states canada and mexico our customers include construction and industrial companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and others in 2002 we added 300000 new customers increasing our total customer base to 17 million completed over 86 million rental transactions and generated revenues of 28 billion 

  

our fleet of rental equipment the largest in the world includes over 500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 37 billion the fleet includes 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to renting equipment we sell used rental equipment act as a dealer for new equipment and sell related merchandise parts and service 

  

  

industry overview 

  

based on industry sources we estimate that the us equipment rental industry has grown from approximately 65 billion in annual rental revenues in 1990 to about 24 billion in 2002 this represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 115 although in the past two years industry rental revenues decreased by about 2 billion the recent downturn in industry revenues is a reflection of the significant slowdown in private nonresidential construction activity which declined 16 in 2002 according to department of commerce data our industry is particularly sensitive to changes in nonresidential construction activity because this sector has been the principal user of rental equipment when nonresidential construction activity eventually rebounds we would expect to see our industry resume its longterm growth trend 

  

we believe that longterm industry growth in addition to reflecting general economic expansion is being driven by the increasing recognition by equipment users of the many advantages that equipment rental may offer compared with ownership they recognize that by renting they can 

  

   

   

   

   

while the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment industrial companies utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance plant turnarounds and other functions requiring the periodic use of equipment we believe that over the long term increasing rentals by the industrial sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth 

  

competitive advantages 

  

we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages 

  

large and diverse rental fleet our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry which allows us to 

  

   

   

   

significant purchasing power we purchase large amounts of equipment merchandise and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing warranty and other terms with our vendors 

  

operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating efficiencies 

  

equipment sharing among branches  we generally group our branches into clusters of 10 to 30 locations that are in the same geographic area each branch within a cluster can access all available equipment in the cluster area this increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches in 2002 the sharing of equipment among branches accounted for approximately 113 or 243 million of our total rental revenue 

  

ability to transfer equipment among branches  the size of our branch network gives us the ability to take advantage of strength at a particular branch or in a particular region by permanently transferring underutilized equipment from weaker to stronger areas in 2002 we permanently transferred 890 million of underutilized fleet in this manner 

  

  

consolidation of common functions  we reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our more than 750 branches such as payroll accounts payable benefits and risk management information technology and credit and collection into 17 credit offices and three service centers 

  

stateoftheart information technology systems we have stateoftheart information technology systems that facilitate our ability to make rapid and informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of 97 information technology specialists that supports our systems 

  

strong brand recognition we have strong brand recognition which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty 

  

geographic and customer diversity we have more than 750 branches in 47 states seven canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from fortune 500 companies to small companies and homeowners in 2002 we served more than 17 million customers and our top ten customers accounted for less than 3 of our revenues we believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including 1 enabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations 2 helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across the country 3 reducing our dependence on any particular customer and 4 reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance 

  

national account program our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs we currently serve 1735 national account customers as the number of our national account customers has grown our revenues from these customers have increased to 422 million in 2002 from 372 million in 2001 and 245 million in 2000 

  

strong and motivated branch management each of our branches has a fulltime branch manager who is supervised by one of our 57 district managers and nine regional vice presidents we believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them—within budgetary guidelines—to make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters senior management closely tracks branch district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews the compensation of branch managers and other branch personnel is linked to their branch’s financial performance and return on assets this incentivizes branch personnel to control costs optimize pricing share equipment with other branches and manage their fleet efficiently 

  

employee training programs  we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction in 2002 more than 4000 of our employees enhanced their skills through 69400 total hours of internal training 

  

risk management and safety programs we believe that we have one of the most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry our risk management department is staffed by 54 experienced professionals and is responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures developing our employee and customer training programs and managing any claims against us 

  

products and services 

  

our principal products and services are described below for financial information concerning our foreign and domestic operations see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

  

equipment rental we offer for rent over 600 different types of equipment on a daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms traffic control equipment trench safety equipment and general tools and light equipment 

  

our fleet of rental equipment is the largest in the world and includes over 500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 37 billion we estimate that each of the following categories accounted for 10 or more of our equipment rental revenues in 2002 i aerial lift equipment approximately 27 ii earth moving equipment approximately 13 and iii forklifts approximately 10 

  

our fleet of rental equipment which currently has a weighted average age of 36 months is one of the newest and best maintained in the industry we intend to increase the weighted average age of our fleet to about 42 months by the end of 2003 over the longer term we may further increase the average age of our fleet to about 45 months this plan reflects our belief that the optimum age of our fleet is somewhat higher than where it is today in estimating the optimum age of our fleet we have taken into account a number of factors including our current estimates regarding the relationship between age and reliability and maintenance costs and the capital expenditures required to maintain the fleet at a particular age we will continue to evaluate these factors and if our estimates prove inaccurate may modify our plan 

  

used equipment sales we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage the age composition and size of our fleet we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth opportunities the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements and local demand and the age of the fleet 

  

we principally sell used equipment through our national sales force which can access many resale markets across north america we also sell used equipment through our website wwwunitedrentalscom which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale

related merchandise parts and other services at most of our branches we sell a variety of supplies and merchandise such as saw blades fasteners drill bits hard hats gloves and other safety equipment and we also offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers 

  

we have launched a program to increase merchandise sales across our network by building on the best practices of our strongest retail locations as part of this program we are 1 upgrading merchandise displays 2 adding merchandise sales representatives and 3 bringing the merchandise to our customers through catalogues and jobsite “trailer” stores our goal is to double our merchandise sales over the next two to three years 

  

our rentalman ™ software we have a subsidiary that develops and markets rentalman tm software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations this software package developed by this subsidiary is used by many of the largest equipment rental companies 

  

customers 

  

our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners our largest customer accounted for approximately 1 of our revenues in 2002 and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 3 of our revenues in 2002 

  

  

our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch and the business composition of the local economy our customers include 

  

   

   

   

   

sales and marketing

we have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction as part of this training our employees are taught to differentiate united rentals to customers by communicating the benefits we offer—stability accessibility equipment knowledge extensive fleet and high service level 

  

suppliers 

  

we have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19 of our rental equipment purchases in 2002 and that our top 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of our rental equipment purchases during that period we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for each of our material equipment categories 

  

  

information technology systems 

  

we have advanced information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our as400 system located at our data center all rental transactions are entered at these workstations and processed on a realtime basis management and branch personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day

we have a backup facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative this backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems 

  

competition 

  

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe that in general large companies enjoy significant competitive advantages compared to smaller operators including greater purchasing power a lower cost of capital the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and with newer and better maintained equipment and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to customer demand for additional information see “—competitive advantages”

there are numerous federal state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety under these laws an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable on a nofault basis for among other things 1 the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on in or emanating from the real estate as well as related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial penalties and 2 environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has been disposed activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing we also dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain locations and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to comply with applicable laws we have acquired or lease certain locations which have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other sources and we are in the process of assessing the nature of the required remediation based on the conditions currently known to us we believe that any unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs required with respect to those conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business however we cannot be certain that we will not identify adverse environmental conditions that are not currently known to us that all potential releases from underground storage tanks removed in the past have been identified or that environmental and safety requirements will not become more stringent or be interpreted and applied more 

  

stringently in the future if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 

  

employees 

  

we have 12937 employees of these employees 3869 are salaried personnel and 9068 are hourly personnel collective bargaining agreements relating to 79 separate locations cover 1063 of our employees we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

we currently operate 751 locations of these locations 669 are in the united states 81 are in canada and one is in mexico the number of locations in each state or province is shown below 

  

united states 

   

our branch locations generally include facilities for displaying equipment and depending on the location may include separate equipment service areas and storage areas 

  

we own 102 of our rental locations and lease the other locations in addition to our rental locations we also lease nonrental locations for example district offices region offices and service centers our leases provide for varying terms and include 43 leases that are on a monthtomonth basis and 36 leases that provide for a remaining term of less than one year and do not provide a renewal option we are currently negotiating renewals for most of the leases that provide for a remaining term of less than one year 

  

  

we maintain a fleet of approximately 10400 vehicles these vehicles are used for delivery maintenance and sales functions we own a portion of this fleet and lease a portion 

  

our corporate headquarters are located in greenwich connecticut where we occupy approximately 40000 square feet under leases for 1 approximately 12000 square feet that extends until 2003 and 2 approximately 28000 square feet that extends until 2004 subject to extension rights the 28000 square feet portion is sufficient for our needs and accordingly we do not plan to renew the lease for the 12000 square feet that expires in 2003 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are party to various litigation matters in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business we cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such pending litigation matters however we believe based on our examination of such matters that our ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 no matter was submitted to a vote of our security holders 

  

part ii 

  




 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters 

  

price range of common stock 

  

our common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “uri” the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange 

  

   

as of march 7 2003 there were approximately 443 holders of record of our common stock we believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our common stock is held of record in broker “street names” 

  

dividend policy 

  

we intend to retain all earnings for the foreseeable future for use in the operation and expansion of our business and accordingly we currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in light of conditions then existing including our earnings financial condition and capital requirements restrictions in financing agreements business conditions and other factors under the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness we are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends on our common stock in addition under delaware law we are prohibited from paying any dividends unless we have capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose 

  

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

we are the largest equipment rental company in the world our revenues are divided into three categories 

  

   

   

   

our cost of operations consists primarily of i depreciation costs relating to the rental equipment that we own and lease payments for the rental equipment that we hold under operating leases ii the cost of repairing and maintaining rental equipment iii the cost of the items that we sell including new and used equipment and related parts merchandise and supplies and iv personnel costs occupancy costs and supply costs 

  

we record rental equipment expenditures at cost and depreciate equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful life which ranges from two to ten years after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to 10 of cost 

  

selling general and administrative expenses primarily include sales commissions bad debt expense advertising and marketing expenses management salaries and clerical and administrative overhead 

  

nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as vehicles computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements ii the amortization of deferred financing costs and iii the amortization of other intangible assets our other intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements as described below effective january 1 2002 we no longer amortize goodwill 

  

we completed acquisitions in each of 2000 2001 and 2002 see note 3 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions we believe that our results for these periods are not directly comparable 

  

change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” issued by the financial accountants standards board “fasb” under this standard our goodwill which we previously amortized over 40 years is no longer amortized we amortized approximately 584 million of goodwill in 2001 our approximately 170 million of other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives under the new accounting standard we are required to periodically review our goodwill for impairment in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense 

  

we completed our initial impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 3489 million 2883 million net of tax we completed a subsequent impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2002 and recorded an additional noncash impairment charge of approximately 

  

2479 million 1988 million net of tax the first impairment charge net of tax benefit was recorded on our statement of operations as a “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” this charge appears below the operating income line and accordingly does not impact operating income the second impairment charge was recorded on our statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” this charge appears above the operating income line and accordingly does impact operating income our stockholders’ equity was reduced by the amount of both charges 

  

we will be required to review our goodwill for further impairment at least annually any future goodwill impairment charge would be recorded on our statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” and would reduce operating income 

  

we test for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch in addition to macroeconomic factors that affect all our branches include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions the fact that we test for impairment on a branchbybranch basis increases the likelihood that we will be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future although we cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future writeoffs 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in applying many accounting principles we need to make assumptions estimates andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified below those of our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions estimates and judgments 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 

  

useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to 10 of cost the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 

  

impairment of goodwill as described above we must periodically determine whether the fair value of our goodwill is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet see “—change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets” we must make estimates and assumptions in evaluating the fair value of goodwill we may be required to change these estimates and assumptions based on changes in economic conditions changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to record additional impairment charges for goodwill 

  

impairment of longlived assets we review the valuation of our longlived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired if this 

  

review indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable then the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value the determination of recoverability is based upon a nondiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset’s remaining useful life we must make estimates and assumptions when applying the nondiscounted cash flow analysis these estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be required to recognize writedowns on our longlived assets 

  

restructuring during 2002 and 2001 we recorded reserves in connection with the restructuring plans described below these reserves include estimates pertaining to workforce reduction costs and costs of vacating facilities and related settlements of contractual obligations although we do not anticipate significant changes the actual costs may differ from these estimates and we may be required to record additional expense not previously recorded 

  

restructuring plans in 2001 and 2002 

  

we adopted a restructuring plan in april 2001 and a second restructuring plan in october 2002 as described below these plans were adopted in response to adverse changes in economic conditions and in branch performance in certain of our markets in connection with these plans we recorded a restructuring charge of 289 million in 2001 including a noncash component of approximately 109 million and 283 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 including a noncash component of approximately 25 million 

  

the 2001 plan involved the following principal elements i 31 underperforming branches and five administrative offices were closed or consolidated with other locations ii the reduction of our workforce by 489 through the termination of branch and administrative personnel and iii certain information technology hardware and software was no longer used 

  

the 2002 plan involved the following key elements i 42 underperforming branches and five administrative offices will be closed or consolidated with other locations including 26 closed or consolidated as of december 31 2002 ii our workforce will be reduced by 412 including 232 terminated as of december 31 2002 and iii a certain information technology project was abandoned we expect to close or consolidate the remainder of the branches and complete the workforce reduction during 2003 

  

the aggregate annual revenues from the 42 branches that are being eliminated as part of the 2002 restructuring amounted to approximately 80 million we estimate that we will retain a substantial portion of these revenues because we expect to i redeploy most of the rental equipment of the eliminated branches to other branches that we project will be able to use this equipment to increase revenues and ii shift a portion of the customer base of the eliminated branches to other locations we cannot however be certain that redeployed equipment will generate increased revenues in line with our projections or that we will not lose more customers than we expect assuming that the retained revenues are in line with our estimate we project that the net savings from the 2002 restructuring will increase our annual operating income by about 20 million 

  

  

the table below provides certain information concerning our restructuring charges for additional information see note 5 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 

  

         

as indicated in table above the aggregate balance of the 2001 and 2002 charges was 271 million as of december 31 2002 we estimate that approximately 134 million of the remaining 2001 and 2002 charges will be incurred by december 31 2003 comprised of approximately 124 million of the cash component and approximately 10 million of the noncash component and approximately 137 million in future periods these payments will not affect our future earnings because the charges associated with these payments have already been recorded in our 2002 or 2001 results we expect to make these payments with cash from our operations 

  

debt refinancings and extraordinary item 

  

we refinanced approximately 1994 million of indebtedness in december 2002 in connection with this transaction we recorded a 16 million charge 09 million net of tax for the writeoff of deferred financing fees attributable to the debt that was refinanced for additional information concerning this transaction see “—liquidity and capital resources—financing transaction in 2002” 

  

we refinanced an aggregate of 16957 million of indebtedness and other obligations in april 2001 in connection with this transaction we recorded the following charges i a pretax extraordinary charge of 181 million 113 million net of tax that relates to the refinancing of indebtedness and primarily reflects the writeoff of deferred financing fees attributable to the debt that was refinanced and ii a pretax charge of 78 million 52 million net of tax that is recorded in other income expense net and relates to the refinancing of a synthetic lease 

  

results of operations 

  

overview of 2002 results 

  

our results in 2002 were hurt by the 5054 million of aftertax charges for noncash goodwill writeoffs and restructuring and refinancing costs described above these charges are the reason that we ended the year with a net loss of 3978 million 

  

  

if you exclude the charges described above in both 2002 and 2001 then we would have had income as adjusted of 1076 million in 2002 representing a 268 decrease from 1470 million in 2001 the table below reconciles our net income loss to our income as adjusted to exclude specified charges we provide this as adjusted data because we believe that an analysis of such data in conjunction with an analysis of the gaap data may be useful to investors in understanding our 2002 results 

  

   

private nonresidential construction declined by 16 in 2002 according to department of commerce data this reduced demand for our equipment and put downward pressure on rental rates and on used equipment prices our rental rates were down 48 and 52 for fullyear and fourthquarter 2002 respectively on a yearoveryear basis the decrease in rental rates was partially offset by a 21 increase in the volume of rental transactions at locations open more than one year and by revenues attributable to new locations partially offset by locations closed or consolidated the net effect was that our total revenues for the year decreased 22 to 28210 million and our samestore rental revenues decreased 27 

  

the decrease in rental rates and used equipment prices and to a lesser extent increases in certain operating costs hurt our gross profit margins our gross profit margin from rentals decreased to 321 in 2002 from 379 in 2001 and our gross profit margin from sales of used rental equipment decreased to 337 in 2002 from 397 in 2001 on an overall basis our gross profit margin declined to 314 in 2002 from 360 in 2001 

  

our lower revenues and gross profit margins in 2002 are the principal factors that caused income as adjusted to decrease to 1076 in 2002 from 1470 in 2001 these negative factors were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 as described above which added approximately 366 million to our 2002 income as adjusted 

  

while income was down in 2002 we maintained ample liquidity we generated cash flow of 6941 million which included 5179 million from operations and the balance from the sale of used rental equipment we used 4923 million of this cash to invest in our rental fleet at yearend we had 453 million drawn under our revolving credit facility leaving us with 4931 million of available borrowing capacity on this facility after taking into account letters of credit

years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

revenues  we had total revenues of 28210 million in 2002 representing a decrease of 22 from total revenues of 28866 million in 2001 the different components of our revenues are discussed below 

  

1 equipment rentals our revenues from equipment rentals were 21547 million in 2002 representing a decrease of 26 from 22129 million in 2001 these revenues accounted for 764 of our total revenues in 2002 compared with 767 of our total revenues in 2001 the decrease in rental revenues principally reflected the following 

  

   

   

2 sales of rental equipment our revenues from the sale of rental equipment were 1762 million in 2002 representing an increase of 198 from 1471 million in 2001 these revenues accounted for 62 of our total revenues in 2002 compared with 51 of our total revenues in 2001 the increase in these revenues in 2002 reflected an increase in volume partially offset by weaker pricing 

  

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our revenues from “sale of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” were 4901 million in 2002 representing a decrease of 69 from 5266 million in 2001 these revenues accounted for 174 of our total revenues in 2002 compared with 182 of our total revenues in 2001 the decrease in these revenues in 2002 principally reflected a decrease in the volume of new equipment sales 

  

gross profit gross profit decreased to 8863 million in 2002 from 10395 million in 2001 this decrease reflected the decrease in total revenues discussed above as well as the decrease in gross profit margin described below from equipment rental and the sale of rental equipment information concerning our gross profit margin by source of revenue is set forth below 

  

1 equipment rentals our gross profit margin from equipment rental revenues was 321 in 2002 and 379 in 2001 the decrease in 2002 principally reflected the decrease in rental rates described above and to a lesser extent higher costs related to employee benefits fleet maintenance and delivery and facilities 

  

2 sales of rental equipment our gross profit margin from sales of rental equipment was 337 in 2002 and 397 in 2001 the decrease in 2002 primarily reflected continued price weakness in the used equipment market 

  

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our gross profit margin from “sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” was 276 in 2002 and 271 in 2001 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2002 primarily reflected better margins for our service revenue 

  

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” were 4389 million or 156 of total revenues during 2002 and 4418 million or 153 of total revenues 

  

during 2001 our bad debt expense which is a component of sga was approximately 95 million higher in 2002 than in 2001 primarily reflecting an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts without this increase in bad debt expense our sga as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to 152 of total revenues in 2002 from 156 in 2001 this decrease in sga excluding the change in bad debt expense primarily reflected our ongoing efforts at cutting costs including reducing the number of administrative personnel reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and collection facilities 

  

goodwill impairment  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2479 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 see “—change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

  

restructuring charge  we recorded a restructuring charge of 283 million in 2002 and 289 million in 2001 see “—restructuring plans in 2002 and 2001” for additional information 

  

nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and amortization was 593 million or 21 of total revenues in 2002 and 1068 million or 37 of total revenues in 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to a new accounting standard discussed above under “—change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets” which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective january 1 2002 if goodwill amortization had been eliminated in 2001 then nonrental depreciation and amortization would have been 485 million or 17 of total revenues in 2001 the increase in nonrental depreciation and amortization in 2002 as compared to the amount in 2001 after eliminating goodwill amortization primarily reflected an increase in our nonrental assets such as facilities and transportation equipment 

  

operating income we recorded operating income of 1119 million in 2002 compared with operating income of 4620 million in 2001 the principal reason for the decrease in 2002 was the 2479 million noncash goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in 2002 however after excluding that charge our operating income was still lower by approximately 1022 million from the 2001 level the principal reason for this decrease was the declines in revenues and gross profit described above the adverse effects of these factors were partially offset by the decrease in nonrental depreciation and amortization described above 

  

interest expense  interest expense decreased to 1960 million in 2002 from 2216 million in 2001 this decrease primarily reflected lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 

  

preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust  preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust were 182 million during 2002 as compared to 195 million during 2001 the decrease in 2002 reflects our repurchase of a portion of our outstanding trust preferred securities 

  

other income expense  other income was 09 million in 2002 compared with other expense of 64 million in 2001 the other income in 2002 was primarily attributable to the favorable settlement of a lawsuit for net proceeds of 40 million partially offset by other charges including the writeoff of 16 million of deferred financing fees as described above the other expense in 2001 was primarily attributable to a 78 million charge relating to the refinancing of a synthetic lease as described above see “—debt refinancings and extraordinary item” 

  

income taxes  income taxes were 81 million in 2002 compared with 920 million in 2001 although we had a loss in 2002 we recorded income tax expense because a portion of our 2479 million goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for federal income tax purposes if you exclude the goodwill impairment charge in calculating our income then our effective tax rate in 2002 would have been 390 compared with 429 in 2001 the decrease in such effective rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 and the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of certain costs included in the 2001 restructuring charge 

  

income loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we had a loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 1095 million in 

  

2002 compared with income before extraordinary item of 1226 million in 2001 the loss in 2002 principally reflects the decrease in operating income described above

years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

revenues  we had total revenues of 28866 million in 2001 representing a decrease of 11 from total revenues of 29189 million in 2000 the different components of our revenues are discussed below 

  

1 equipment rentals our revenues from equipment rentals were 22129 million 2001 representing an increase of 76 from 20567 million in 2000 these revenues accounted for 767 of our total revenues in 2001 compared with 705 of our total revenues in 2000 the increase in rental revenues reflected the following

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our revenues from “sale of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” were 5266 million in 2001 representing an increase of 24 from 5145 million in 2000 these revenues accounted for 182 of our total revenues in 2001 compared with 176 of our total revenues in 2000 the 24 increase in sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues was attributable to the increase in the volume of transactions 

  

gross profit gross profit decreased to 10395 million in 2001 from 10886 million in 2000 this decrease reflected the decrease in total revenues discussed above as well as the decrease in gross profit margin described below from equipment rental and the sales of rental equipment information concerning our gross profit margin by source of revenue is set forth below 

  

1 equipment rentals our gross profit margin from equipment rental revenues was 379 in 2001 and 399 in 2000 the decrease in 2001 principally reflected i an increase in our cost of equipment rental which was principally attributable to an increase in the amount of equipment that we hold under operating leases rather than owning and ii the decrease in rental rates described above 

  

2 sales of rental equipment our gross profit margin from the sales of rental equipment was 397 in 2001 and 401 in 2000 this decrease was primarily the result of modest price declines in some geographic areas 

  

3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues our gross profit margin from “sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” was 271 in 2001 and 249 in 2000 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2001 primarily reflected i lower costs resulting from our ongoing efforts to consolidate 

  

our suppliers and further capitalize on our purchasing power and ii a shift in mix which resulted in more of our sales being attributable to higher margin areas such as providing services and merchandise sales 

  

selling general and administrative expenses  sga was 4418 million or 153 of total revenues during 2001 and 4543 million or 156 of total revenues during 2000 the decrease in sga in 2001 primarily reflected costcutting measures that we have taken including reducing the number of administrative personnel reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and collection facilities 

  

restructuring charge  we recorded a restructuring charge of 289 million in 2001 see “—restructuring plans in 2001 and 2002” for additional information 

  

nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and amortization was 1068 million or 37 of total revenues in 2001 and 863 million or 30 of total revenues in 2000 the increase in the dollar amount of nonrental depreciation and amortization in 2001 primarily reflected i the amortization of goodwill attributable to acquisitions completed during 2000 and ii additional nonrental vehicles which generally have shorter useful lives 

  

operating income we recorded operating income of 4620 million in 2001 compared with operating income of 5479 million in 2000 the principal reason for the decrease in 2001 was the 289 million restructuring charge and the decrease in revenues from the sale of rental equipment described above 

  

interest expense  interest expense decreased to 2216 million in 2001 from 2288 million in 2000 this decrease primarily reflected lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 

  

preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust  during 2001 and 2000 preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust were 195 million 

  

other income expense  other expense was 64 million in 2001 compared with other income of 18 million in 2000 the increase in other expense in 2001 was primarily attributable to the 78 million charge we incurred relating to the refinancing costs of a synthetic lease as described under “—debt refinancings and extraordinary item” 

  

income taxes  income taxes were 920 million or an effective rate of 429 in 2001 compared to 1251 million or an effective rate of 415 in 2000 the increase in the effective rate in 2001 was primarily attributable to the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of certain costs included in the restructuring charge 

  

income before extraordinary item we had income before extraordinary item of 1226 million in 2001 compared with income before extraordinary item of 1764 million in 2000 the decrease in 2001 principally reflected the decrease in operating income and the 64 million of other expense described above

liquidity and capital resources 

  

financing transaction in 2002 

  

in december 2002 we sold 2100 million aggregate principal amount of our 10 ¾ senior notes due 2008 the gross proceeds to us from the sale of the notes were approximately 2038 million and the net proceeds were approximately 1994 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses these new notes are unsecured and were issued by united rentals north america inc “uri” a wholly owned subsidiary of united rentals inc “holdings” and are guaranteed by holdings and subject to limited exceptions our domestic subsidiaries we used the net proceeds to i permanently repay approximately 

  

997 million of outstanding indebtedness under our existing term loan and ii repay approximately 997 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility for additional information concerning this transaction see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in connection with the offering of the notes we amended the agreement governing our existing term loan and revolving credit facility to among other things i provide us with greater flexibility in maintaining or satisfying certain financial ratios and tests required thereunder through the end of 2004 and ii reduce the maximum borrowing available under our revolving credit facility from 750 million to 650 million 

  

certain balance sheet changes 

  

the decrease in goodwill at december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001 was primarily attributable to the writeoffs of goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 as further described under “—change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets” the decrease in deferred taxes at december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001 was primarily attributable to the tax effects of the goodwill writeoff and the exercise of stock options in 2002 the decrease in retained earnings and stockholders’ equity at december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001 reflects our net loss in 2002 the increase in additional paidin capital at december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001 was primarily attributable to i the issuance of additional shares upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock partially offset by common stock repurchased and retired and ii the repurchase of 1469000 shares of our companyobligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities at a price less than their liquidation preference 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

during 2002 we i generated cash from operations of 5179 million ii generated cash from the sale of rental equipment of 1762 million iii received cash of 638 million from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and iv obtained cash from borrowings net of repayments of approximately 166 million we used cash during this period principally to i pay consideration for acquisitions 1726 million ii purchase rental equipment 4923 million iii purchase other property and equipment 386 million iv purchase and retire shares of our outstanding common stock 267 million and v repurchase and retire shares of our convertible preferred securities 381 million 

  

certain information concerning our credit facility 

  

our revolving credit facility enables united rentals north america inc “uri” our wholly owned subsidiary to borrow up to 650 million on a revolving basis and enables one of uri’s canadian subsidiaries to borrow up to 50 million provided that the aggregate borrowings of uri and the canadian subsidiary may not exceed 650 million up to 175 million of the revolving credit facility is available in the form of letters of credit the revolving credit facility will mature and terminate on october 20 2006 

  

as of december 31 2002 borrowings under the revolving credit facility by uri accrue interest at our option at either a the abr rate which is equal to the greater of i the federal funds rate plus 05 or ii the chase manhattan bank’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 or b an adjusted libor rate plus a margin of 250 the above interest rate margins are adjusted quarterly based on our financial leverage ratio up to maximum margins of 175 and 275 for revolving loans based on the abr rate and the adjusted libor rate respectively and down to minimum margins of 075 and 175 for revolving loans based on the abr rate and the adjusted libor rate respectively if at any time an event of default exists the interest rate applicable to each loan will increase by 2 per annum we are also required to pay the lenders a commitment fee equal to 05 per annum in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility 

  

certain information concerning receivables securitization 

  

we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which one of our subsidiaries can borrow up to 250 million against a collateral pool of accounts receivable the borrowings under the facility and the 

  

receivables in the collateral pool are included in the liabilities and assets respectively reflected on our consolidated balance sheet key terms of this facility include 

  

   

   

   

   

as of december 31 2002 i the outstanding borrowings under the facility were approximately 1605 million and ii the aggregate face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool was approximately 3468 million the agreement governing this facility which was amended in june 2001 contemplates that the term of the facility may extend for up to three years from the date of the amended facility however on each anniversary of such date the consent of the lender is required for the facility to renew for the next year the next anniversary date is in june 2003 we plan to seek the lenders’ approval for renewal or alternatively seek to obtain a new facility the lenders under this facility may at their option terminate the facility in the event that our longterm senior secured debt securities are at any time rated “b” or below by standard  poor’s rating services or “b1” or below by moody’s investor service 

  

cash requirements related to operations 

  

our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility as of march 11 2003 we had 4591 million of borrowing capacity available under our 650 million revolving credit facility reflecting outstanding loans of approximately 481 million and outstanding letters of credit in the amount of approximately 1428 million we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months 

  

we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service and v costs relating to our restructuring plans we plan to fund such cash requirements relating to our existing operations from our existing sources of cash described above in addition we plan to seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment for information on the scheduled principal payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases see “—certain information concerning contractual obligations” 

  

the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects based on current conditions we estimate that capital expenditures for the year 2003 will be approximately 350 million for our existing operations these expenditures are comprised of approximately 300 million of expenditures to replace rental equipment sold and 50 million of expenditures for the purchase of nonrental equipment we expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of used equipment cash generated from operations and if required borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 

  

we plan to increase the weighted average age of our fleet which is approximately 36 months to 42 months by the end of 2003 over the longer term we may further increase the average age of our fleet to about 45 months this plan reflects our belief that the optimum age of our fleet is somewhat higher than where it is today in estimating the optimum age of our fleet we have taken into account a number of factors including our current estimates regarding the relationship between age and reliability and maintenance costs and the capital 

  

expenditures required to maintain the fleet at a particular age we will continue to evaluate these factors and if our estimates prove inaccurate may modify our plan 

  

while emphasizing internal growth we may also continue to expand through a disciplined acquisition program we will consider potential transactions of varying size and may on a selective basis pursue acquisition or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privatelyheld companies we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient to fund such future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing and consequently our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy 

  

certain information concerning contractual obligations 

  

the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations 

  

     

certain information concerning offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

restricted stock we have granted to employees other than executive officers and directors approximately 1165000 shares of restricted stock that contain the following provisions the shares vest in 2004 2005 or 2006 or earlier upon a change in control of the company death disability retirement or certain terminations of employment and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting on certain other terminations of employment the violation of noncompete provisions and certain other events the grants provide that we will pay to employees who vest in their restricted stock and who sell their restricted stock within five trading days after vesting a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of i approximately 300000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less than 2726 but more than 1517 ii a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately 500000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales 

  

are less than 1517 but more than 918 and iii a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately 1165000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less than 918 

  

operating leases we lease real estate rental equipment and nonrental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity as part of many of our equipment operating leases we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value the use of these guarantees helps to lower our monthly operating lease payments we believe that the projected residual values are reasonable and accordingly that we are not likely to incur material obligations pursuant to such guarantees however we cannot be certain that the actual residual values will not turn out to be significantly below the projected values that we guaranteed our maximum potential liability under these guarantees is 2316 million which represents the aggregate amount that we would be required to pay if the residual value was zero for all equipment subject to such guarantees in conformity with applicable accounting standards this potential liability is not recorded on our balance sheet for additional information concerning lease payment obligations under our operating leases see “—certain information concerning contractual obligations” and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

certain information concerning trust preferred securities 

  

in august 1998 a subsidiary trust of united rentals inc sold six million shares of 6½ convertible quarterly income preferred securities “trust preferred securities” for aggregate consideration of 300 million during 2002 we repurchased 1469000 of these shares for aggregate consideration of approximately 381 million which represents a discount of approximately 48 relative to the aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 735 million 

  

relationship between holdings and uri 

  

united rentals inc “holdings” is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary united rentals north america inc “uri” and subsidiaries of uri holdings provides certain services to uri in connection with its operations these services principally include i senior management services ii finance related services and support iii information technology systems and support and iv acquisition related services in addition holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by uri and its subsidiaries uri has made and expects to continue to make certain payments to holdings in respect of the services provided by holdings to uri the expenses relating to uri’s payments to holdings are reflected on uri’s financial statements as selling general and administrative expenses in addition although not legally obligated to do so uri has in the past and expects that it will in the future make distributions to holdings to among other things enable holdings to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities that were issued by a subsidiary trust of holdings as described above 

  

the trust preferred securities are the obligation of a subsidiary trust of holdings and are not the obligation of uri as a result the dividends payable on these securities are reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of holdings but are not reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of uri this is the principal reason why the net income reported on the consolidated financial statements of uri is higher than the net income reported on the consolidated financial statements of holdings 

  

fluctuations in operating results 

  

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term certain of the general factors that may cause such fluctuations are discussed under “—factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forward looking statements—fluctuations of operating results” 

  

accounting for certain expenses relating to potential acquisitions 

  

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize certain direct outofpocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions 

  

indirect acquisition costs such as executive salaries general corporate overhead public affairs and other corporate services are expensed as incurred our policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that we determine will not be consummated there can be no assurance that in future periods we will not be required to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy which charge depending upon the magnitude thereof could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months the seasonality of our business is heightened because we offer for rent traffic control equipment branches that rent a significant amount of this type of equipment tend to generate most of their revenues and profits in the second and third quarters of the year slow down during the fourth quarter and operate at a loss during the first quarter 

  

inflation 

  

although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations we believe that inflation has not had and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  

we adopted the financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” effective january 1 2002 this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 17 “intangible assets” under this standard goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests on a reporting unit level for additional information see “change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets” other intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 

  

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” we adopted this standard on january 1 2002 the adoption of sfas no 144 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this standard rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and an amendment of that statement sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” this standard also rescinds sfas no 44 “accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers” this standard amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and certain lease modifications this standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we adopted this standard on january 1 2003 and we will reclassify a pretax extraordinary loss of approximately 181 million recognized during the second quarter of 2001 to operating income the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 145 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan this standard nullifies eitf issue 

  

no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this interpretation requires certain guarantees entered into after december 31 2002 to be initially recognized and recorded at fair value and also requires new disclosures related to guarantees even if the likelihood of a guarantor having to make payments under the guarantees is remote we adopted this interpretation as of december 31 2002 and such adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” this standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” but does not require us to use the fair value method this standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stockbased employee compensation we adopted the disclosure portion of this standard as of december 31 2002 and such adoption is reflected in note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forwardlooking statements 

  

sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities 

  

our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities consequently decreases in construction or industrial activity due to a recession or other reasons may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge any such decrease could adversely affect our revenues and operating results for example as discussed above our 2002 revenues pricing and operating results were adversely affected by a significant decline in nonresidential construction activity 

  

we have identified below certain factors that may cause a further downturn in construction and industrial activity either temporarily or longterm 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition demand for our equipment may not reach projected levels in the event that funding for highway and other construction projects under government programs is reduced 

  

fluctuations of operating results 

  

we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

substantial goodwill 

  

at december 31 2002 we had on our balance sheet net goodwill in the amount of 17052 million which represented approximately 364 of our total assets at such date this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually in general this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense any writeoff would adversely affect our results as was the case in 2002 as described above 

  

we test for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch in addition to macro economic factors that affect all our branches include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions the fact that we test for impairment on a branchbybranch basis increases the likelihood that we will be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future although we cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future writeoff 

  

substantial indebtedness 

  

at december 31 2002 our total indebtedness was approximately 25128 million our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways for example it will or could 

  

   

   

   

furthermore if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our business we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

  

we cannot be sure that any of these strategies could be effected on favorable terms or at all 

  

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations at december 31 2002 we had 8449 million of variable rate indebtedness 

  

need to satisfy financial and other covenants in debt agreements 

  

under the agreements governing our credit facility and our term loan we are required to among other things satisfy certain financial tests relating to a minimum interest coverage ratio b the ratio of funded debt to cash flow c the ratio of senior debt to tangible assets and d the ratio of senior debt to cash flow if we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants the lenders could elect to terminate the credit facility and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and our term loan in such event unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the revolving credit facility we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above we cannot be sure that any alternative strategy could be effected on favorable terms or at all 

  

we are also subject to various other covenants under the agreements governing our credit facility term loan and other indebtedness these covenants limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness pay dividends make investments create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these covenants could adversely affect our business by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility 

  

dependence on additional capital 

  

if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing we cannot however be certain that any additional financing will be available or if available will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including those relating to purchasing equipment making acquisitions opening new rental locations and refinancing existing indebtedness 

  

certain risks relating to acquisitions 

  

we have grown in part through acquisitions and may continue to do so the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including 

  

   

   

   

we cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will not be harmed as a result of acquisitions 

  

dependence on management 

  

our success is highly dependent on the experience and skills of our senior management team if we lose the services of any member of this team and are unable to find a suitable replacement we may not have the depth of senior management resources required to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy we do not maintain “key man” life insurance on the lives of members of senior management 

  

  

competition 

  

the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing the prices that we can charge 

  

dependence on information technology systems 

  

our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions 

  

liability and insurance 

  

we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business these possible claims include those relating to 1 personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us 2 motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and service personnel and 3 employment related claims we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

if we are found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by insurance our operating results could be adversely affected we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms if at all 

  

environmental and safety regulations 

  

our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things 1 the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and 2 fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of our locations 

  

based on the conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 

  

  

labor matters 

  

we have 1063 employees that are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements if we should experience a prolonged labor dispute involving a significant number of our employees our ability to serve our customers could be adversely affected furthermore our labor costs could increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes 

  

operations outside the united states 

  

our operations in canada and mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations these include 1 the need to convert currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 2 the need to comply with foreign laws and 3 the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of 1 interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and 2 foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 

  

interest rate risk we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2002 we had interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 5000 million the effect of some of these agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to 95 on 2000 million of our term loan the effect of the remainder of these agreements is to convert 3000 million of our fixed rate 9 1  4  notes to a floating rate instrument through 2009 

  

we have the following indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate i all borrowings under our 650 million revolving credit facility 453 million outstanding as of december 31 2002 ii our term loan 6390 million remaining outstanding as of december 31 2002 and iii all borrowings under our 250 million accounts receivable securitization facility 1605 million outstanding as of december 31 2002 the weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of december 31 2002 were i 53 for the revolving credit facility ii 48 for the term loan and iii 22 for the receivables securitization facility based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding taking into account our interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2002 approximately 9449 million in the aggregate our earnings would decrease by approximately 58 million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility from time to time for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

currency exchange risk the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based upon the level of our canadian operations during 2002 relative to the company as a whole a 10 change in this exchange rate would have caused our earnings to change by approximately 18 million in addition we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our transaction exposures at december 31 2002 we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

derivative financial instruments 

  

under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” all derivatives are required to be recorded as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are recognized immediately or deferred depending on the use of the derivative and whether or not it qualifies as a hedge derivative financial instruments are periodically used by the company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes

preferred stock 

  

the company issued series a perpetual convertible preferred stock “series a preferred” and series b perpetual convertible preferred stock “series b preferred” in 1999 and included such preferred stock in stockholders’ equity in july 2001 the sec issued guidance to all public companies as to when redeemable preferred stock may be classified as stockholders’ equity this guidance indicates that preferred stock that would be subject to redemption on the occurrence of an event outside the control of the issuer may not be classified as equity and that the probability of the event occurring is not a factor to be considered under this guidance the series a preferred and series b preferred would not be included in stockholders’ equity because this stock would be subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control on september 28 2001 the company entered into an agreement effecting the exchange of new series c perpetual convertible preferred stock “series c preferred” for the series a preferred and new series d perpetual convertible preferred stock “series d preferred” for the series b preferred see note 11 the series c preferred and series d preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control and is classified as stockholders’ equity under the recently issued sec guidance

the weighted average fair value of options granted was 557 734 and 770 during 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model which uses subjective assumptions which can materially affect fair value estimates and therefore does not necessarily provide a single measure of fair value of options the company used a riskfree interest rate average of 201 374 and 515 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively a volatility factor for the market price of the company’s common stock of 66 49 and 69 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and a weightedaverage expected life of options of approximately three years in 2002 2001 and 2000 for purposes of these pro forma disclosures the estimated fair value of options is amortized over the options’ vesting period since the number of options granted and their fair value may vary significantly from year to year the pro forma compensation expense in future years may be materially different

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” the company adopted this standard on january 1 2002 and such adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this standard rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and an amendment of that statement sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” this standard also rescinds sfas no 44 “accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers” this standard amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and certain lease modifications this standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions the company adopted this standard on january 1 2003 and will reclassify a pretax extraordinary loss of approximately 181 million recognized during the second quarter of 2001 to operating income the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 145 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan this standard nullifies eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” the restructuring charge in 2002 was recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 943 sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this interpretation requires certain guarantees entered into after december 31 2002 to be initially recognized and recorded at fair value and also requires new disclosures related to guarantees even if the likelihood of a guarantor having to make payments under the guarantees is remote the company adopted this interpretation as of december 31 2002 and such adoption did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” this standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” but does not require the company to use the fair value method this standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stockbased employee compensation the company adopted the disclosure portion of this standard as of december 31 2002 and such adoption is reflected under “—stockbased compensation” above

on june 30 2002 the company acquired 35 rental locations from national equipment services inc for initial consideration of approximately 1116 million in cash which was determined based primarily on the number of locations acquired and their financial performance the acquisition of these rental locations was made to complement the company’s existing network of rental locations the results of operations of the acquisitions are included in the company’s statement of operations as of the date of acquisition the initial consideration paid by the company for the other 2002 acquisition was approximately 459 million in cash the company estimates that approximately 931 million of goodwill related to the 2002 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes

approximately 1531 million and consisted of 838 million in cash and 761905 shares of common stock and 593 million in seller notes in addition the company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness of these companies acquired in the aggregate amount of approximately 55 million 

  

the aggregate initial consideration paid by the company for other 2000 acquisitions that were accounted for as purchases was 2102 million and consisted of approximately 1846 million in cash and 62 million in seller notes in addition the company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness of the companies acquired in the other 2000 acquisitions in the aggregate amount of 775 million 

  

the purchase prices for all acquisitions accounted for as purchases have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at their respective acquisition dates however the company has not completed its valuation of all of its purchases and accordingly the purchase price allocations are subject to change when additional information concerning asset and liability valuations are completed the preliminary purchase price allocations that are subject to change primarily consist of rental and nonrental equipment valuations these allocations are finalized within 12 months of the acquisition date and are not expected to result in significant differences between the preliminary and final allocations 

  

the following table summarizes on an unaudited pro forma basis the combined results of operations of the company for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 as though each acquisition described above was made on january 1 2001 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the unaudited pro forma results are based upon certain assumptions and estimates which are subject to change these results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that might have occurred nor are they necessarily indicative of expected results in the future 

  

4 goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

changes in the company’s carrying amount of goodwill for 2002 are as follows in thousands 

  

   

the company adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” issued by the financial accountants standards board “fasb” under this standard goodwill which was previously amortized over 40 years is no longer amortized the company amortized approximately 584 million of goodwill in 2001 the 

  

united rentals inc 

  

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

company’s approximately 58 million of other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives under the new accounting standard the company is required to periodically review its goodwill for impairment in general this means that the company must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value shown on its balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value the company is required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense 

  

the company completed its initial impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 3489 million 2883 million net of tax the company completed a subsequent impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2002 and recorded an additional noncash impairment charge of approximately 2479 million the first impairment charge net of tax was recorded on the statement of operations as a “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” the second impairment charge was recorded on the statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” the company’s stockholders’ equity was reduced by the amount of both charges 

  

the impairment charges recognized in 2002 related to certain branches that decreased in value the factors that negatively affected the value of these branches included the following i continued weakness in nonresidential construction spending which negatively affected the earnings of the company’s branches and ii to a lesser extent operational weakness at some branches and increased competition for some branches fair values used in impairment testing were based upon valuation techniques using multiples of earnings and revenues 

  

the company is required to review its goodwill for further impairment at least annually any future goodwill impairment charge would be recorded on the statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” and would reduce operating income 

  

the company tests for goodwill impairment on a branchbybranch basis rather than on an aggregate basis this means that a goodwill writeoff is required even if only one or a limited number of the company’s branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all its branches on an aggregate basis factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch in addition to macroeconomic factors that affect all the company’s branches include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions since the company tests for impairment on a branchbybranch basis the company believes that it may be required to take additional noncash goodwill writeoffs in the future although it cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future writeoffs

item 1  business

general

    united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world we
offer for rent over 600 types of equipmenteverything from heavy machines to
hand toolsthrough our network of more than 740 rental locations in the united
states canada and mexico our customers include construction and industrial
companies manufacturers utilities municipalities homeowners and others in
2001 we served more than 14 million customers completed over 84 million
rental transactions and generated revenues of 29 billion

    our fleet of rental equipment the largest in the world includes over
500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 36 billion
the fleet includes

     general construction and industrial equipment such as backhoes
      skidsteer loaders forklifts earth moving equipment material handling
      equipment compressors pumps and generators

     aerial work platforms such as scissor lifts and boom lifts

     general tools and light equipment such as power washers water pumps
      heaters and hand tools

     traffic control equipment such as barricades cones warning lights
      message boards and pavement marking systems and

     trench safety equipment for below ground work such as trench shields
      aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates
      construction lasers and line testing equipment

    in addition to renting equipment we sell used rental equipment act as a
dealer for new equipment and sell related merchandise parts and service

industry background

    we estimate that the us equipment rental industry has grown from
approximately 65 billion in annual rental revenues in 1990 to over 25
billion in 2000 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately
145 industry data for 2001 is not yet available but we expect that industry
growth during the recession was significantly lower than the historical
longterm growth rate we believe that longterm industry growth in addition
to reflecting general economic expansion is being driven by the increasing
recognition by equipment users of the many advantages that equipment rental may
offer compared with ownership they recognize that by renting they can

     avoid the large capital investment required for equipment purchases

     access a broad selection of equipment and select the equipment best
      suited for each particular job

                                      1

page

     reduce storage and maintenance costs and

     access the latest technology without investing in new equipment

    while the construction industry has to date been the principal user of
rental equipment industrial companies utilities and others are increasingly
using rental equipment for plant maintenance plant turnarounds and other
functions requiring the periodic use of equipment the market for rental
equipment is also benefiting from increased government funding for
infrastructure projects

competitive advantages

    we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages

    large and diverse rental fleet  our rental fleet is the largest and most
comprehensive in the industry which allows us to

     attract customers by providing onestop shopping

     serve a diverse customer base and reduce our dependence on any particular
      customer or group of customers and

     serve customers that require substantial quantities andor wide varieties
      of equipment

    significant purchasing power  we purchase large amounts of equipment
merchandise and other items which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing
warranty and other terms with our vendors

    operating efficiencies  we benefit from the following operating
efficiencies

    equipment sharing among branches  we generally group our branches into
clusters of 10 to 30 locations that are in the same geographic area each
branch within a cluster can access all available equipment in the cluster area
this increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one
branch can be marketed and rented through other branches in 2001 the sharing
of equipment among branches accounted for approximately 102 or 226 million
of our total rental revenue

    ability to transfer equipment among branches  the size of our branch
network allows us to transfer equipment from branches that may have
underutilized equipment to branches that require additional equipment for
example in 2001 we transferred 793 million of equipment among our branches

    consolidation of common functions  we reduce costs through the
consolidation of functions that are common to our more than 740 branches such
as payroll accounts payable and credit and collection into 18 credit offices
and three service centers

    stateoftheart information technology systems  we have stateoftheart
information technology systems that facilitate our ability to make rapid and
informed decisions respond quickly to changing market conditions and share
equipment among branches we have an inhouse team of approximately 100
information technology specialists that supports our systems

    geographic and customer diversity  we have more than 740 branches in 47
states seven canadian provinces and mexico and serve customers that range from
fortune 500 companies to small companies and homeowners in 2001 we served
more than 14 million customers and our top ten customers accounted for less
than 3 of our revenues we believe that our geographic and customer diversity
provide us with many advantages including 1 enabling us to better serve
national account customers with multiple locations

                                      2

page

2 helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used
equipment resale markets across the country 3 reducing our dependence on any
particular customer and 4 reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional
economic conditions have on our overall financial performance

    national account program  our national account sales force is dedicated to
establishing and expanding relationships with large companies particularly
those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account
customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america a
wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their
equipment needs our national account team includes 34 professionals serving
approximately 1700 national account customers our revenues from national
account customers increased more than 50 to 372 million in 2001 from 245
million in 2000 we estimate that these revenues will increase to approximately
450 million in 2002

    risk management and safety programs  we believe that we have one of the
most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry our
risk management department is staffed by 41 experienced professionals and is
responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures developing our
employee and customer training programs and managing any claims against us

    strong and motivated branch management  each of our branches has a
fulltime branch manager who is supervised by one of our 59 district managers
and nine regional vice presidents we believe that our managers are among the
most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower themwithin
budgetary guidelinesto make daytoday decisions concerning branch matters
senior management closely tracks branch district and regional performance with
extensive systems and controls including performance benchmarks and detailed
monthly operating reviews the compensation of branch managers and other branch
personnel is linked to their branchs financial performance and return on
assets this incentivizes branch personnel to control costs optimize pricing
share equipment with other branches and manage their fleet efficiently

strategy

    key elements of our business strategy include

    continue to increase rental revenues  despite the recession we increased
total rental revenues in 2001 by 76 and same store rental revenues by 56
we also added 300000 new rental customers we will continue to promote this
growth by

     actively managing the composition and size of our fleet to meet customer
      needs respond to local demand and adjust to changing economic conditions

     promoting equipment sharing and crossmarketing of equipment specialties

     focusing on providing outstanding customer service and support

     marketing our services to existing and potential national account
      customers that can benefit from our ability to provide a broad selection
      of equipment and a consistently high level of service throughout
      north america and

     marketing our extensive fleet of specialized lines of equipment
      including 1 aerial work platforms 2 traffic control equipment and
      3 trench safety equipment

    increase merchandise sales  we generated about 175 million of revenues in
2001 from our business of selling merchandisesuch as drill bits gloves hard
hats and safety equipmentthat can be used with our equipment approximately
50 of our 2001 merchandise revenues were generated by less than 15 of our
branch locations towards the end of 2001 we initiated efforts to encourage
all of our branches to aggressively build this business our goal is to double
the size of this business over the next two to three years

                                      3

page

    continue to control expenses  we reduced selling general and
administrative expenses in 2001 by 126 million we are seeking to continue to
control these expenses in a number of ways including further reducing
administrative costs further consolidating credit and collection centers and
streamlining advertising

    selectively open new branches and make acquisitions  we intend to continue
to selectively open new branches and make acquisitions that will expand our
geographic reach enhance our operating efficiency and increase our market
share in seeking acquisition candidates we generally focus on those that will
have the potential to be accretive to earnings

    continue flexible business model  we have a flexible business model when
the economy is strong we increase investment in our fleet to support strong
revenue and earnings growth during a recessionary environment we reduce the
rate at which we invest in new equipment which increases free cash flow
available to pay down debt although reducing fleet investment ages our fleet
somewhat we have the flexibility to do so because the fleet investment that we
make during the uppart of the business cycle results in the age of our fleet
being at the low end of our target range as we enter a downturn in view of the
recessionary environment we reduced fleet investment in 2001 this enabled us
to generate 346 million in free cash flow after capital expenditures of 497
million and to pay down almost 250 million of debt we expect to pay down an
additional 250 million of debt in 2002 as the economy improves we will
resume operating the business for significant revenue and earnings growth and
again accelerate the rate at which we invest in new equipment to support
aggressive growth

products and services

    our principal products and services are described below for financial
information concerning our foreign and domestic operations see note 15 of the

    equipment rental  we offer for rent over 600 different types of equipment
on a daily weekly or monthly basis the types of equipment that we offer
include general construction and industrial equipment aerial work platforms
traffic control equipment trench safety equipment and general tools and light
equipment

    our fleet of rental equipment is the largest in the world and includes over
500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 36 billion
we estimate that each of the following categories accounted for 10 or more of
our equipment rental revenues in 2001 i aerial lift equipment approximately
29 ii earth moving equipment approximately 15 and iii forklifts
approximately 11

    our fleet of rental equipment which currently has a weighted average age
of 31 months is one of the newest and best maintained in the industry based
on the rate at which we expect to purchase new equipment and sell used
equipment this year we expect that the average age will increase to
approximately 37 months in 2002 over the longer term we plan to maintain the
average age of our fleet in the 35 to 45 month range

    used equipment sales  we routinely sell used rental equipment and invest
in new equipment in order to manage the age composition and size of our fleet
we also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment
the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a
number of factors including changing general economic conditions growth
opportunities the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer
requirements and local demand and the age of the fleet

    we principally sell used equipment through 1 our national sales force
which can access many resale markets across north america and 2 our web site

to further increase our purchasing power we estimate that our largest supplier
accounted for approximately 31 of our equipment purchases in 2001 and that
our top 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 87 of our equipment
purchases during that period we believe that we have alternative sources of
supply for each of our material equipment categories

information technology systems

    we have advanced information technology systems which facilitate rapid and
informed decisionmaking and enable us to respond quickly to changing market
conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are
electronically linked to our other locations and to our as400 system located
at our data center all rental transactions are entered at these workstations
and processed on a realtime basis management and branch personnel can access
the systems 24 hours a day

    these systems

     allow management to obtain a wide range of operating and financial data

     enable branch personnel to 1 determine equipment availability 2
      access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment
      to be delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer 3
      monitor business activity on a realtime basis and 4 obtain customized
      reports on a wide range of operating and financial data including

systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to
assist branch personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the
systems to newly acquired locations and manages our web site

competition

    the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our
competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two
rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states
public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and
dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe
that in general large companies enjoy significant competitive advantages
compared to smaller operators including greater purchasing power a lower cost
of capital the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment
and services and with newer and better maintained

advantages

environmental and safety regulations

    there are numerous federal state and local laws and regulations governing
environmental protection and occupational health and safety under these laws
an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable on a nofault basis for among
other things 1 the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic
substances located on in or emanating from the real estate as well as
related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial penalties
and 2 environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has
been disposed activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our
use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of
solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing we also
dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks
located at certain locations and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to
comply with applicable laws we have acquired or lease certain locations which
have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other
sources and we are in the process of assessing the nature of the required
remediation based on the conditions currently known to us we believe that any
unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs required with respect
to those conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business
however we cannot be certain that we will not identify adverse environmental
conditions that are not currently known to us that all potential releases from
underground storage tanks removed in the past have been identified or that
environmental and safety requirements will not become more stringent or be
interpreted and applied more stringently in the future if we are required to
incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently
anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected depending on the
magnitude of the cost

item 3  legal proceedings

    we are party to various litigation matters in most cases involving
ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business we cannot estimate with
certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such
pending litigation matters however we believe based on our examination of
such matters that our ultimate liability will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations

general

    we are the largest equipment rental company in the world our revenues are
divided into three categories

     equipment rentalsthis category includes our revenues from renting
      equipment this category also includes related revenues such as the fees
      we charge for equipment delivery fuel repair of rental equipment and
      damage waivers

     sales of rental equipmentthis category includes our revenues from the
      sale of used rental equipment

     sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenuesthis category
      principally includes our revenues from the following sources i the
      sale of new equipment ii the sale of supplies and merchandise iv
      repair services and the sale of parts for equipment owned by customers
      and v the operations of our subsidiary that develops and markets
      software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating
      multiple branch locations

    our cost of operations consists primarily of i depreciation costs
relating to the rental equipment that we own and lease payments for the rental
equipment that we hold under operating leases ii the cost of repairing and
maintaining rental equipment iii the cost of the items that we sell
including new and used equipment and related parts merchandise and supplies
and iv personnel costs occupancy costs and supply costs

    we record rental equipment expenditures at cost and depreciate equipment
using the straightline method over the estimated useful life which ranges
from 2 to 10 years after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to
10 of cost

    selling general and administrative expenses primarily include sales
commissions advertising and marketing expenses management salaries and
clerical and administrative overhead

    nonrental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense
associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as vehicles
computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with
leasehold improvements ii the amortization of deferred financing costs and
iii the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the
estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired as described below
effective january 1 2002 we will no longer amortize goodwill our other
intangible assets are principally noncompete agreements

    we completed acquisitions in each of 1999 2000 and 2001 see note 3 to the
notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
report in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were
affected by acquisitions we believe that our results for these periods are not
directly comparable

change in accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets

    effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets issued by
the financial accountants standards board fasb under this standard our
goodwill which we previously amortized over 40 years will no longer be
amortized we amortized 584 million of goodwill in 2001 our approximately
158 million of other intangible assets which consist of noncompete
agreements will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives we
will be required to review our goodwill for impairment during the first six
months of 2002 and at least annually thereafter in general this means that we
must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill determined in accordance
with applicable accounting standards is at least equal to the recorded value
shown on our balance sheet if the fair value of the goodwill falls below the
recorded value we will be required to writeoff the excess goodwill and to

                                      12

page

treat this writeoff as an expense we are currently performing the initial
impairment analysis required by the new accounting standard and estimate that
we will record a noncash charge in the first quarter of 2002 of approximately
350 million this charge will be recorded on the income statement as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and will reduce our
stockholders equity by the amount of the charge

critical accounting policies

    we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states a summary of our
significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to the notes to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in
applying many accounting principles we need to make assumptions estimates
andor judgments these assumptions estimates and judgments are often
subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our
analysis material changes in these assumptions estimates and judgments have
the potential to materially alter our results of operations we have identified
below those of our accounting policies that we believe could potentially
produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions
estimates and judgments

    allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for doubtful
accounts this allowance reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables
that we will be unable to collect our estimate could require change based on
changing circumstances including changes in the economy or in the particular
circumstances of individual customers accordingly we may be required to
increase or decrease our allowance

    useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment  we depreciate
rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives
after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0 to 10 of cost the
useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the
asset will generate revenues and the salvage value is determined based on our
estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such
period we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our
industry or other changing circumstances if these estimates change in the
future we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation
expense for these assets

    impairment of goodwill  as described above we must periodically determine
whether the fair value of our goodwill is at least equal to the recorded value
shown on our balance sheet see change in accounting treatment for goodwill
and other intangible assets we must make estimates and assumptions in
evaluating the fair value of goodwill we may be required to change these
estimates and assumptions based on changes in our business prospects or other
changing circumstances if these estimates change in the future we may be
required to record impairment charges for goodwill not previously recorded

    restructuring  during 2001 we recorded reserves in connection with the
restructuring plan described below these reserves include estimates pertaining
to workforce reduction costs and costs of vacating facilities and related
settlements of contractual obligations although we do not anticipate
significant changes the actual costs may differ from these estimates and we
may be required to record additional expense not previously recorded

restructuring plan in 2001

    during 2001 we adopted a restructuring plan involving the following
principal elements i 31 underperforming branches were closed or consolidated
with other locations ii five administrative offices were closed or
consolidated with other locations iii the reduction of our workforce by 489
through the termination of branch and administrative personnel including 440
terminated as of december 31 2001 and iv certain information technology
hardware and software was no longer used

    the aggregate annual revenues from the 31 branches that were eliminated
amounted to approximately 82 million we expect that we will retain
approximately 54 million of this revenue by shifting the business of some of
the closed branches to other locations we estimate that we will realize annual
cost savings from the branch closures of approximately 33 million

                                      13

    we recorded in the second quarter of 2001 a restructuring charge of
approximately 289 million relating to the restructuring plan described above
during 2001 total activity was approximately 219 million consisting of
approximately 110 million of cash payments and approximately 109 million of
noncash charges of the remaining 70 million of this charge approximately
36 million will be paid by december 31 2002 and approximately 34 million
will be paid in future periods

    the restructuring charge includes 1 the cost of vacating facilities
primarily the payment of obligations under leases offset by estimated sublease
opportunities 99 million the writeoff of capital improvements made to
such facilities 28 million and the writeoff of related goodwill 56
million 2 workforce reduction costs primarily severance and 3
information technology costs comprised of the abandonment of certain
information technology projects 25 million and the payment of obligations
under equipment leases relating to such projects 25 million the table

debt refinancing and extraordinary item

    we refinanced an aggregate of 16957 million of indebtedness and other
obligations in april 2001 as described under liquidity and capital
resourcesfinancing transactions in 2001 we recorded the following charges
relating to this refinancing in the second quarter of 2001 i a pretax
extraordinary charge of 181 million 113 million net of tax that relates
to the refinancing of indebtedness and primarily reflects the writeoff of
deferred financing fees and ii a pretax charge of 78 million 52
million net of tax that is recorded in other income expense net and
relates to the refinancing of a synthetic lease

results of operations

  general overview of 2001

    our revenues were 28866 million in 2001 compared with 29189 million
in 2000 the 11 decrease in 2001 revenues was due to lower sales of used
rental equipment as further described below in response to the recession we
slowed investment in new equipment and held existing equipment longer our
other revenue categories increased in 2001 rental revenues increased 76 and
revenues from sale of equipment and merchandise and other revenues increased
24 growth in rental revenues at locations open more than one year or same
store rental revenues was 56 for 2001 and 30 in the fourth quarter of
2001 rental rates for 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2001 were down 08 and
11 respectively compared to the corresponding prior year periods

    in response to weakness in the economy we slowed investment in new
equipment and held existing equipment longer this enabled us to increase free
cash flow and repay debt we generated approximately 346 million of free cash
flow in 2001 after capital expenditures of approximately 497 million and
used a portion of this cash to pay down approximately 247 million of debt and
synthetic lease obligations because we slowed our sale of used equipment our
revenues from the sales of rental equipment was down 2006 million or 577
in 2001 prices for used equipment were somewhat lower in the second half of
2001 than at the beginning of 2001

                                      14

page

    the decrease in revenues from sales of rental equipment and the 289
million restructuring charge described above are the principal reasons for the
decrease in our operating income to 4620 million in 2001 from 5479 million
in 2000 this decrease in operating income and the 78 million pretax charge
described above relating to the refinancing of a synthetic lease are the
principal reasons for the decrease in our income before extraordinary item to
1226 million in 2001 from 1764 million in 2000

    if the economy improves we should have the potential to increase same
store revenue growth however we believe that our results will not reflect the
effects of a strengthening economy until the second half of 2002 at the
earliest in addition as described above under change in accounting
treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets we expect to incur a
charge in the first quarter associated with a change in accounting treatment
even without that charge which will depress first quarter earnings we would
not expect an increase in earnings per share for 2002 over 2001 levels other
than earnings increases attributable to elimination of goodwill amortization
under the new accounting treatment

additional information

   years ended december 31 2001 and 2000

    revenues  we had total revenues of 28866 million in 2001 representing
a decrease of 11 from total revenues of 29189 million in 2000 the
different components of our revenues are discussed below

    1 equipment rentals  our revenues from equipment rentals was 22129
million 2001 representing an increase of 76 from 20567 million in 2000
these revenues accounted for 767 of our total revenues in 2001 compared with
705 of our total revenues in 2000 the increase in rental revenues reflected
the following

     we increased our revenues at locations open more than one year this
      increase accounted for approximately 56 percentage points of the total
      increase of 76 the increase in revenues at these locations was due to
      an increase in the volume of transactions which was more than sufficient
      to offset a decline in rental rates as described above rental rates for
      full year 2001 and fourth quarter 2001 were down 08 and 11
      respectively compared to the corresponding year ago periods

     we also had additional revenues because we added new rental locations
      through startups and acquisitions these additional revenues net of
      revenues lost due to locations sold or closed accounted for
      approximately 20 percentage points of the total increase of 76

    2 sales of rental equipment  our revenues from the sale of rental
equipment were 1471 million in 2001 representing a decrease of 577 from
3477 million in 2000 these revenues accounted for 51 of our total revenues
in 2001 compared with 119 of our total revenues in 2000 this decrease
principally reflected our decision discussed above to slow investment in new
equipment and hold existing equipment longer during a recessionary environment

    3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues  our revenues
from sale of equipment and merchandise and other revenues were 5266
million in 2001 representing an increase of 24 from 5145 million in 2000
these revenues accounted for 182 of our total revenues in 2001 compared with
176 of our total revenues in 2000 the 24 increase in sales of equipment
and merchandise and other revenues was attributable to the increase in the
volume of transactions

    gross profit  our gross profit decreased to 10395 million in 2001 from
10886 million in 2000 this decrease reflected the decrease in total
revenues discussed above as well as the decrease in gross profit margin
described below from equipment rental and the sales of rental equipment
information concerning our gross profit margin by source of revenue is set
forth below

    1 equipment rentals  our gross profit margin from equipment rental
revenues was 379 in 2001 and 399 in 2000 the decrease in 2001 principally
reflected i an increase in our cost of equipment rental which was
principally attributable to an increase in the amount of equipment that we hold
under operating leases rather than owning and ii the decrease in rental
rates described above

                                      15

page

    2 sales of rental equipment  our gross profit margin from the sales of
rental equipment was 397 in 2001 and 401 in 2000 this decrease was
primarily the result of modest price declines in some geographic areas

    3 sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues  our gross profit
margin from sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues was 271
in 2001 and 249 in 2000 the increase in the gross profit margin in 2001
primarily reflected i lower costs resulting from our ongoing efforts to
consolidate our suppliers and further capitalize on our purchasing power and
ii a shift in mix which resulted in more of our sales being attributable to
higher margin areas such as providing services and merchandise sales

    selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and
administrative expenses sga were 4418 million or 153 of total
revenues during 2001 and 4543 million or 156 of total revenues during
2000 the decrease in sga in 2001 primarily reflected costcutting measures
that we have taken including reducing the number of administrative personnel
reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and
collection facilities we are seeking to continue to cut costs in a number of
ways including further reducing administrative costs further consolidating
credit and collection centers and streamlining advertising

    restructuring charge  we recorded a restructuring charge of 289 million
in 2001 see restructuring plan in 2001 for additional information

    nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and
amortization was 1068 million or 37 of total revenues in 2001 and 863
million or 30 of total revenues in 2000 the increase in the dollar amount
of nonrental depreciation and amortization in 2001 primarily reflected 1 the
amortization of goodwill attributable to acquisitions completed during 2000 and
2 additional nonrental vehicles which generally have shorter useful lives

    interest expense  interest expense decreased to 2216 million in 2001
from 2288 million in 2000 this decrease primarily reflected lower interest
rates on our variable rate debt

    preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust  during 2001 and 2000 preferred
dividends of a subsidiary trust were 195 million

    other income expense  other expense was 64 million in 2001 compared
with other income of 18 million in 2000 the increase in other expense in
2001 was primarily attributable to the 78 million charge we incurred relating
to the refinancing costs of a synthetic lease as described under debt
refinancing and extraordinary item

    income taxes  income taxes were 920 million or an effective rate of
429 in 2001 compared to 1251 million or an effective rate of 415 in
2000 the increase in the effective rate in 2001 was primarily attributable to
the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of certain costs included in the
restructuring charge

    extraordinary item  we recorded an extraordinary charge of 181 million
113 million net of tax in 2001 see debt refinancing and extraordinary
item for additional information

   years ended december 31 2000 and 1999

    revenues  we had total revenues of 29189 million in 2000 representing
an increase of 307 over total revenues of 22336 million in 1999 our
revenues in 2000 and 1999 by source were as follows i equipment rental
revenues were 20567 million or 705 of revenues in 2000 compared to
15810 million or 708 of revenues in 1999 ii revenues from the sale of
rental equipment were 3477 million or 119 of revenues in 2000 compared to
2357 million or 106 of revenues in 1999 and iii revenues from sales
of equipment and merchandise and other revenues were 5145 million or 176
of revenues in 2000 compared to 4169 million or 187 of revenues in 1999

                                      16

page

    the 307 increase in total revenues in 2000 reflected the following

     we increased our revenues at locations open more than one year this
      increase accounted for approximately 129 percentage point of the total
      increase of 307 this same store growth was attributable to i
      increases in the volume of transactions and utilization rates which
      accounted for 109 of the 129 percentage points and ii price
      increases which accounted for 20 of the 129 percentage points the
      increase in volume primarily reflected a an increase in rental
      transactions b an increase in the sale of related merchandise and
      parts which was driven by the increase in equipment rental transactions
      and c an increase in the sale of used equipment

     we also had additional revenues because we added new rental locations
      through startups and acquisitions these additional revenues net of
      revenues lost due to locations sold or closed accounted for
      approximately 178 percentage point of the total increase of 307

    gross profit  gross profit increased to 10886 million in 2000 from
8249 million in 1999 this increase in gross profit was primarily
attributable to the increase in revenues described above our gross profit
margin by source of revenue in 2000 and 1999 was i equipment rental 399
in 2000 and 394 in 1999 ii sales of rental equipment 401 in 2000 and
420 in 1999 and iii sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues
249 in 2000 and 246 in 1999 the increase in the gross profit margin from
rental revenues in 2000 was primarily attributable to greater equipment
utilization rates and to economies of scale the decrease in the gross profit
margin from the sales of rental equipment in 2000 reflected a change in the age
mix of the used equipment sold in general the sale of relatively new
equipment generates lower gross profit margins than the sale of somewhat older
equipment

    selling general and administrative expenses  sga was 4543 million or
156 of total revenues during 2000 and 3526 million or 158 of total
revenues during 1999 sga in 1999 included an 83 million charge primarily
due to professional fees incurred in connection with a terminated tender offer
excluding this charge sga as a percentage of revenues was 154 in 1999

    nonrental depreciation and amortization  nonrental depreciation and
amortization was 863 million or 30 of total revenues in 2000 and 629
million or 28 of total revenues in 1999

    interest expense  interest expense increased to 2288 million in 2000
from 1398 million in 1999 this increase primarily reflected i an increase
in our indebtedness principally to fund acquisitions and ii an increase in
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt

    preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust  during 2000 and 1999 preferred
dividends of a subsidiary trust were 195 million

    other income expense  other income was 18 million in 2000 compared to
83 million of other expense in 1999 the other expense in 1999 was
attributable to a 99 million charge that principally related to fees that we
paid for a 20 billion financing commitment that was subsequently cancelled
upon termination of a tender offer made by us in 1999

    income taxes  income taxes increased to 1251 million or an effective
rate of 415 in 2000 from 991 million or an effective rate of 410 in
1999

liquidity and capital resources

financing transactions in 2001

    set forth below is information concerning certain financing transactions
completed in 2001

    refinancing transaction  in april 2001 we refinanced all of the
indebtedness that was then outstanding on our old revolving credit facility and
term loans in order to effect this refinancing we

     issued 4500 million of 10 34 senior notes due 2008 the 1034
      notes

     obtained a new senior secured credit facility comprised of a 7500
      million term loan and a 7500 million revolving credit facility and

     used the proceeds from the 1034 notes the new term loan and borrowings
      under the new revolving credit facility to i permanently repay the
      outstanding balance under our old revolving credit facility 4760
      million ii repay outstanding term loans 11885 million and iii
      repay an outstanding synthetic lease 312 million

    receivables securitization   we have an accounts receivable securitization
facility under which one of our subsidiaries can borrow up to 250 million
against a collateral pool of accounts receivable during 2001 this subsidiary
increased its outstanding borrowings under this facility by 1015 million for
additional information see certain information concerning receivables
securitization

certain balance sheet changes

    the decrease in debt at december 31 2001 compared to december 31 2000 was
attributable to increased principal payments due to increased cash flow from
operations during 2001 the increase in additional paid in capital at december
31 2001 compared to december 31 2000 was primarily attributable to our
perpetual convertible preferred stock being included in stockholders equity on
the december 31 2001 balance sheet but not on the december 31 2000 balance

certain information concerning receivables securitization

    we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which one of
our subsidiaries can borrow up to 250 million against a collateral pool of
accounts receivable the borrowings under the facility and the receivables in
the collateral pool are included in the liabilities and assets respectively
reflected on our consolidated balance sheet key terms of this facility include

     borrowings may be made only to the extent that the face amount of the
      receivables in the collateral pool exceeds the outstanding loans by a
      specified amount

     the facility is structured so that the receivables in the collateral pool
      are the lenders only source of repayment

     prior to expiration or early termination of the facility amounts
      collected on the receivables may subject to certain conditions be
      retained by the borrower provided that the remaining receivables in the
      collateral pool are sufficient to secure the then outstanding borrowings
      and

     after expiration or early termination of the facility we will repay the
      borrowings

    as of december 31 2001 i the outstanding borrowings under the facility
were approximately 2015 million and ii the aggregate face amount of the
receivables in the collateral pool was approximately 3376 million the
agreement governing this facility which was amended in june 2001 contemplates
that the term of the facility may extend for up to three years from the date of
the amended facility however on each anniversary of such date the consent of
the lender is required for the facility to renew for the next year the next
anniversary date is in june 2002 we plan to seek the lenders approval for
renewal

certain information concerning operating leases

    from time to time we have entered into operating leases pursuant to which
we lease as lessee equipment or real estate certain of these leases were
entered into as part of sale and leaseback transactions in 2001 we were the
sellerlessee in saleleaseback transactions with unrelated third parities in
which we sold rental equipment and real estate for aggregate proceeds of 510
million for additional information concerning lease payment obligations under
our operating leases see certain information concerning contractual
obligations and note 14 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this report

certain information concerning trust preferred securities

    in august 1998 a subsidiary trust of united rentals inc sold six million
shares of 6 convertible quarterly income preferred securities trust
preferred securities for aggregate consideration of 300 million during
2002 we repurchased 335000 of these shares having an aggregate liquidation
preference of approximately 168 million for aggregate consideration of
approximately 115 million

relationship between holdings and uri

    united rentals inc holdings is principally a holding company and
primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary united
rentals north america inc uri and subsidiaries of uri holdings
provides certain services to uri in connection with its operations these
services principally include i senior management services ii finance
related services and support iii information technology systems and support
and iv acquisition related services in addition holdings leases certain
equipment and real property that are made available for use by uri and its
subsidiaries uri has made and expects to continue to make certain payments
to holdings in respect of the services provided by holdings to uri the
expenses relating to uris payments to holdings are reflected on uris
financial statements as selling general and administrative expenses in
addition although not legally obligated to do so uri has in the past and
expects that it will in the future make

                                      19

page

distributions to holdings to among other things enable holdings to pay
dividends on the trust preferred securities that were issued by a subsidiary
trust of holdings as described above 

    the trust preferred securities are the obligation of a subsidiary trust of
holdings and are not the obligation of uri as a result the dividends payable
on these securities are reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial
statements of holdings but are not reflected as an expense on the consolidated
financial statements of uri this is the principal reason why the net income
reported on the consolidated financial statements of uri is higher than the net
income reported on the consolidated financial statements of holdings

cash requirements related to operations

    our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations
and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility as of march 12
2002 we had 5026 million of borrowing capacity available under our 750
million revolving credit facility reflecting outstanding loans of
approximately 1675 million and outstanding letters of credit in the amount of
approximately 799 million we believe that our existing sources of cash will
be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months

    we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing
operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating activities and
working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items
offered for sale iii payments due under operating leases iv debt service
and v costs relating to the restructuring charge we plan to fund such cash
requirements relating to our existing operations from our existing sources of
cash described above in addition we plan to seek additional financing through
the securitization of certain of our equipment

    as described above the annual renewal of our accounts receivable
securitization facility requires the lenders consent if we do not obtain this
consent then the facility will terminate in june 2002 and we will repay the
borrowings thereunder in addition we are required to make principal payments
of approximately 213 million in 2002 in respect of other indebtedness we may
also elect to repay debt that is not due

    the amount of our capital expenditures during 2002 will depend on a number
of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects based
on current conditions we estimate that capital expenditures for the year 2002
will be approximately 435 million for our existing operations these
expenditures are comprised of approximately i 280 million of expenditures to
replace rental equipment sold ii 115 million of discretionary expenditures
to increase the size of our rental fleet and iii 40 million of expenditures
for the purchase of nonrental equipment we expect that we will fund such
expenditures from proceeds from the sale of used equipment cash generated from
operations and if required borrowings available under our revolving credit
facility

    we estimate that the weighted average age of our rental fleet which
currently is approximately 31 months will increase up to approximately 37
months in 2002 as a result of the rate at which we purchase new equipment and
sell used equipment we ultimately plan to maintain an average age ranging from
35 to 45 months

    while emphasizing internal growth we may also continue to expand through a
disciplined acquisition program we expect to pay for future acquisitions using
cash capital stock notes andor assumption of indebtedness to the extent
that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient to fund
such future acquisitions we will require additional debt or equity financing
and consequently our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing
stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy there can be
no assurance however that any additional financing will be available or if
available will be on terms that are satisfactory to us

   securitization facility terminate in 2002 as described under certain

   consent being obtained the term of this facility will be extended
   extension of the facility in 2002 would reduce the debt payable in 2002 from
   2228 million to 213 million and increase by a corresponding amount the
   debt payable in the year during which the extended facility terminates

fluctuations in operating results

    we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter or over the longer term certain of the general factors that
may cause such fluctuations are discussed under factors that may influence
future results and accuracy of forward looking statementsfluctuations of
operating results

accounting for certain expenses relating to potential acquisitions

    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states we capitalize certain direct outofpocket expenditures such as legal
and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions indirect
acquisition costs such as executive salaries general corporate overhead
public affairs and other corporate services are expensed as incurred our
policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to
any potential or pending acquisition that we determine will not be consummated
there can be no assurance that in future periods we will not be required to
incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy which charge
depending upon the magnitude thereof could adversely affect our results of
operations

seasonality

    our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be
lower in the winter months the seasonality of our business has been heightened
by our acquisition of businesses that specialize in renting traffic control
equipment these businesses tend to generate most of their revenues and profits
in the second and third quarters of the year slow down during the fourth
quarter and operate at a loss during the first quarter

inflation

    although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our
operations we believe that inflation has not had and is not likely in the
foreseeable future to have a material impact on our results of operations

impact of recently issued accounting standards

    in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations this
standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations
and supersedes apb opinion no 16 business combinations and sfas no 38
accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises all
business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for
using one method the purchase method effectve july 1 2001 the company
adopted sfas no 141

    in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no
17 intangible assets this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 however this standard is immediately effective in
cases where goodwill and other intangible assets are acquired after june 30
2001 under this standard goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests for additional information see change in accounting
treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets

    in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets this standard addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
and supersedes sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived
assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of this standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 the adoption of sfas no
144 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations

factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forwardlooking
statements

sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities

    our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and
industrial activities consequently decreases in construction or industrial
activity due to a recession or other reasons may lead to a decrease in the
demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge any such decrease
could adversely affect our revenues and operating results for example as
discussed above we expect that until the economy strengthens our same store
rental revenues and pricing will be down on a yearoveryear basis due to the
current recessionary environment

    we have identified below certain factors that may cause a further downturn
in construction and industrial activity either temporarily or longterm

     a continuation or a worsening of the current recessionary environment

     an increase in interest rates or

     adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular
      region

    in addition demand for our equipment may not reach projected levels in the
event that funding for highway and other construction projects under government
programs such as the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21
does not reach expected levels a recent proposal by the president would if
enacted by congress reduce tea21 spending by up to approximately 86 billion
beginning in late 2002

fluctuations of operating results

    we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors these
factors include

     seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending
      to be lower in the winter

     completion of acquisitions

     changes in the amount of revenue relating to renting traffic control
      equipment since revenues from this equipment category tend to be more
      seasonal than the rest of our business

                                      22

page

     changes in the size of our rental fleet or in the rate at which we sell
      our used equipment

     changes in demand for our equipment or the prices therefor due to changes
      in economic conditions competition or other factors

     changes in the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt

     if we determine that a potential acquisition will not be consummated the
      need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to such
      transaction such as financing commitment fees merger and acquisition
      advisory fees and professional fees previously capitalized and

     the possible need from time to time to take other writeoffs or special
      charges due to a variety of occurrences such as the adoption of new
      accounting standards store consolidations or closings or the refinancing
      of existing indebtedness

substantial indebtedness

    at december 31 2001 our total indebtedness was approximately 24595
million our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely
in a number of ways for example it will or could

     require us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt
      service reducing the funds available for other purposes

     constrain our ability to obtain additional financing particularly since
      substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests
      relating to existing indebtedness or

     make it difficult for us to cope with a downturn in our business or a
      decrease in our cash flow

    furthermore if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our
business we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include

     reducing or delaying capital expenditures

     limiting our growth

     seeking additional capital

     selling assets or

     restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness

    we cannot be sure that any of these strategies could be effected on
favorable terms or at all

    a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are
linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service
obligations at december 31 2001 we had 10172 million of variable rate
indebtedness

dependence on additional capital

    if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash that we
may borrow under our credit facility is not sufficient to fund our capital
requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing we
cannot however be certain that any additional financing will be available or
if available will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us if we are
unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we may be unable
to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business including
those relating to purchasing equipment making acquisitions opening new rental
locations and refinancing existing indebtedness

restrictive covenants

    we are subject to various restrictive financial and operating covenants
under the agreements governing our indebtedness these covenants limit or
prohibit among other things our ability to incur indebtedness make
prepayments of certain indebtedness make investments create liens make
acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions these
covenants could adversely affect our business by significantly limiting our
operating and financial flexibility

                                      23

page

certain risks relating to acquisitions

    we have grown in part through acquisitions and may continue to do so the
making of acquisitions entails certain risks including

     unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover
      during our due diligence investigations

     difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
      company with our existing operations

     loss of key employees of the acquired company and

     difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and
      policies

    we cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits from our
acquisitions or that our existing operations will not be harmed as a result of
acquisitions

substantial goodwill

    at december 31 2001 we had on our balance sheet net goodwill in the
amount of 21998 million which represented approximately 435 of our total
assets at such date this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the
excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the
estimated fair market value of the net assets of those businesses if the fair
value of the goodwill determined in accordance with applicable accounting
standards were to fall below the recorded value shown on the balance sheet we
would be required to write off the excess goodwill any writeoff would
adversely affect our results for information concerning a charge relating to
goodwill that we expect to take in the first quarter of 2002 see change in
accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets

dependence on management

    our success is highly dependent on the experience and skills of our senior
management team if we lose the services of any member of this team and are
unable to find a suitable replacement we may not have the depth of senior
management resources required to efficiently manage our business and execute
our strategy we do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of
members of senior management

competition

    the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our
competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two
rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states
public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and
dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the
future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from
new companies in addition equipment manufacturers may commence or increase
their existing efforts relating to renting and selling equipment directly to
our customers or potential customers competitive pressures could adversely
affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or
depressing the prices that we can charge

dependence on information technology systems

    our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and
control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions any
disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as
expected could depending on the magnitude of the problem adversely affect our
operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control
our operations and adjust to changing market conditions

                                      24

liability and insurance

    we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business these
possible claims include those relating to 1 personal injury or death caused
by equipment rented or sold by us 2 motor vehicle accidents involving our
delivery and service personnel and 3 employment related claims we carry a
broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations
however such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons
including

     our coverage is subject to a deductible of 10 million and limited to a
      maximum of 980 million per occurrence

     we do not maintain coverage for environmental liability other than
      legally required fuel storage tank coverage since we believe that the
      cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit that it provides
      and

     certain types of claims such as claims for punitive damages or for
      damages arising from intentional misconduct which are often alleged in
      third party lawsuits might not be covered by our insurance

    if we are found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by
insurance our operating results could be adversely affected we cannot be
certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically
reasonable terms if at all

environmental and safety regulations

    our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental
protection and occupational health and safety matters these laws regulate such
issues as wastewater stormwater solid and hazardous wastes and materials and
air quality under these laws we may be liable for among other things 1
the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well
as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless
of fault and 2 fines and penalties for noncompliance our operations
generally do not raise significant environmental risks but we use hazardous
materials to clean and maintain equipment and dispose of solid and hazardous
waste and wastewater from equipment washing and store and dispense petroleum
products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain of
our locations

    based on the conditions currently known to us we do not believe that any
pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a material adverse
effect on our business we cannot be certain however as to the potential
financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are
discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent if
we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are
not currently anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected
depending on the magnitude of the cost

labor matters

    we have 1013 employees that are represented by unions and covered by
collective bargaining agreements if we should experience a prolonged labor
dispute involving a significant number of our employees our ability to serve
our customers could be adversely affected furthermore our labor costs could
increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes

operations outside the united states

    our operations outside the united states are subject to the risks normally
associated with international operations these include 1 the need to convert
currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in
exchange rates 2 the need to comply with foreign laws and 3 the
possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries

                                      25

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

    our exposure to market risk primarily consists of 1 interest rate risk
associated with our variable rate debt and 2 foreign currency exchange rate
risk primarily associated with our canadian operations

    interest rate risk  we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements
to manage and mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates at december
31 2001 we had interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements with
an aggregate notional amount of 5000 million the effect of some of these
agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to 95 on 2000 million of
our term loan the effect of the remainder of these agreements is to convert
3000 million of our fixed rate 9 14 notes to a floating rate instrument
through 2009

    we have the following indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate
i all borrowings under our 750 million revolving credit facility 713
million outstanding as of december 31 2001 ii our term loan 7444
million remaining outstanding as of december 31 2001 and iii all
borrowings under our 250 million accounts receivable securitization facility
2015 million outstanding as of december 31 2001 the weighted average
interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of december 31 2001
were i 45 for the revolving credit facility ii 53 for the term loan
and iii 26 for the receivables securitization facility based upon the
amount of variable rate debt outstanding taking into account our interest rate
swap agreements as of december 31 2001 approximately 112 billion in the
aggregate our net income would decrease by approximately 68 million for
each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate
significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding
under the revolving credit facility from time to time for additional
information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 8 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

    currency exchange risk  the functional currency for our canadian
operations is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be
affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian
dollars based upon the current level of our canadian operations a 10 change
in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings in
addition we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our
transaction exposures at december 31 2001 we had no outstanding foreign
exchange contracts we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts
for speculative purposes

for rent over 600 different types of equipment to more than 12 million
customers including construction and industrial companies manufacturers
utilities municipalities homeowners and others during 2000 we completed
more than 84 million rental transactions

    we have the largest fleet of rental equipment in the world with over
500000 units having an original purchase price of approximately 34 billion
our fleet includes

       light to heavy construction and industrial equipment such as aerial
        lifts backhoes skidsteer loaders forklifts earth moving equipment
        material handling equipment compressors pumps and generators

       traffic control equipment such as barricades cones warning lights
        message boards and pavement marking systems

       trench safety equipment for below ground work such as trench shields
        aluminum hydraulic shoring systems slide rails crossing plates
        construction lasers and line testing equipment

       special event equipment used for sporting corporate and other large
        events such as light towers air conditioning units portable power
        units electrical cable temporary kitchens and tents and

       general tools and equipment such as power washers water pumps
        heaters and hand tools

    in addition to renting equipment we sell used rental equipment act as a
dealer for new equipment and sell related merchandise parts and service

competitive advantages

    we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages

    large and diverse rental fleet we have the largest and most comprehensive
equipment rental fleet in the industry which helps us to

       attract customers by providing onestop shopping

                                       1
page

       serve a diverse customer base and reduce our dependence on any
        particular customer or group of customers and

       serve customers that require assurance that substantial quantities of
        different types of equipment will be available on a continuing basis

   operating efficiencies we generally group our branches into clusters of 10
to 30 locations that are in the same geographic area our information
technology systems allow each branch to access all available equipment within a
cluster we believe that our cluster strategy produces significant operating
efficiencies by enabling us to 1 market equipment within a cluster through
multiple branches 2 crossmarket equipment specialties of different branches
within each cluster and 3 reduce costs by centralizing common functions such
as payroll accounts payable and credit and collection into 26 credit offices
and three service centers in 2000 approximately 107 of our rental revenue
was attributable to equipment sharing among branches

   geographic diversity we have branches in 47 states seven canadian
provinces and mexico we believe that our geographic diversity reduces the
impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall
financial performance our geographic diversity and large network of branch
locations also give us the ability to better serve national account customers
better serve customers that operate at multiple locations and access used
equipment resale markets across the country

   customer diversity our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from
fortune 500 companies to small companies and homeowners we estimate that our
top ten customers accounted for approximately 2 of our revenues during 2000

   strong and motivated branch management each of our branches has a fulltime
branch manager who is supervised by one of our 66 district managers and nine
regional vice presidents we believe that our managers are among the most
knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower themwithin
budgetary guidelinesto make daytoday decisions concerning staffing
pricing equipment purchasing and other branch matters management closely
tracks branch district and region performance with extensive systems and
controls including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating
reviews we promote equipment sharing among branches through our incentive
compensation program which links the compensation of branch personnel to their
branchs financial performance and return on assets

   significant purchasing power we purchase large amounts of equipment and
other items which enables us to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors
our purchasing power is further increased by our ongoing efforts to narrow our
vendor base for example we reduced the number of our primary equipment
suppliers from 111 to 28 in 2000 this allowed us to lower our equipment
purchase costs by approximately 150 million in 2000 and should enable us to
save additional amounts in 2001 we expect to realize additional savings by
similarly consolidating our merchandise suppliers and negotiating more
favorable warranty terms with key vendors

   national account program our national account sales force is dedicated to
establishing and expanding relationships with larger companies particularly
those with a national or multiregional presence we offer our national account
customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across north america
and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs our national
account team currently includes 39 professionals we currently have over 1300
national account customers including more than 700 new accounts added in 2000
our revenues from national account customers increased to approximately 2448
million in 2000 from 891 million in the prior year

                                       2

   information technology systems our information technology systems
facilitate rapid and informed decision making and permit us to respond quickly
to changing market conditions our systems provide management with a wide range
of operating and financial data enable our branches to manage a wealth of
information such as customer requirements equipment availability and
maintenance histories and give our customers online access to their accounts
our systems also enable branch personnel to search for needed equipment
throughout a geographic region determine its closest location and arrange for
delivery to a customers work site we have an inhouse team of approximately
100 information technology specialists that supports our systems and extends
them to new locations we also have a subsidiary that is the leading provider
of proprietary software to the equipment rental industry for use in managing
and operating multiple branch locations our software includes the
rentalmantm system developed by this subsidiary

   risk management and safety programs we place great emphasis on risk
reduction and safety and believe that we have one of the most comprehensive
risk management and safety programs in the industry our risk management
department is staffed by 43 experienced professionals and is responsible for
implementing our safety programs and procedures developing our employee and
customer training programs and managing any claims against us our insurance
and claims costs were approximately 48 below the national average for
comparable industries in 2000 resulting in significant cost savings

industry background

    industry size and growth the us equipment rental industry has grown from
about 6 billion in annual rental revenues in 1990 to over 25 billion in 2000
representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 145 this
information is based on data reported by manfredi  associates inc in
addition to reflecting general economic growth we believe that the growth in
the equipment rental industry is being driven by the following trends

        recognition of advantages of renting equipment users are increasingly
    recognizing the many advantages that equipment rental may offer compared
    with ownership they recognize that by renting they can

            avoid the large capital investment required for equipment
             purchases

            access a broad selection of equipment and select the equipment
             best suited for each particular job

            reduce storage and maintenance costs and

            access the latest technology without investing in new equipment

        outsourcing although growth in the equipment rental industry has to
    date been largely driven by an increase in rentals by the construction
    industry we believe that the cost and other advantages of renting
    together with the general trend toward the corporate outsourcing of
    noncore competencies are increasingly leading industrial companies
    municipalities government agencies utilities and others to rent
    equipment

corporate background

    we began operations in october 1997 and have grown through a combination of
internal growth acquisitions and the opening of new rental locations in
september 1998 we merged with us rentals inc at the time of the merger
us rentals was the second largest equipment rental company in the united
states based on 1997 rental revenues

customer accounted for more than 05 of our revenues during 2000 and that our

purchases during that period

information technology systems

informed decision making and enable us to respond quickly to changing market
conditions each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are
electronically linked to our other locations and to our as400 system located

systems provides hardware and technology support operates a support desk to
assist branch personnel in the daytoday use of the systems extends the
systems to newly acquired locations and manages our web site

competition

    the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our
competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two
rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states
public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and
dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we believe
that in general large companies enjoy significant competitive advantages
compared to smaller operators including greater purchasing power a lower cost
of capital the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment
and services and with newer and better maintained equipment and greater
flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to customer
demand for additional information see competitive advantages

environmental and safety regulations

    there are numerous federal state and local laws and regulations governing
environmental protection and occupational health and safety under these laws
an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable on a nofault basis for among
other things 1 the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic
substances located on in or emanating from the real estate as well as
related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial penalties
and 2 environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has
been disposed activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our
use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and

                                       6
page

our disposal of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment
washing we also dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground
storage tanks located at certain locations and at times we must remove or
upgrade tanks to comply with applicable laws we have acquired or lease certain
locations which have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground
tanks or other sources and we are in the process of assessing the nature of
the required remediation based on the conditions currently known to us we
believe that any unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs
required with respect to those conditions will not have a material adverse
effect on our business however we cannot be certain that we will not identify
adverse environmental conditions that are not currently known to us that all
potential releases from underground storage tanks removed in the past have been
identified or that environmental and safety requirements will not become more
stringent or be interpreted and applied more stringently in the future if we
are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are
not currently anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected
depending on the magnitude of the cost

employees

    as of march 1 2001 we had 14795 employees of these employees 4163 are
salaried personnel and 10632 are hourly personnel collective bargaining

completed 245 acquisitions through march 1 2001 including the merger with
us rentals the us rentals merger which was completed in september 1998

    three of the acquisitions completed by the company including the us

    the other 242 acquisitions completed by the company were accounted for as

    cash requirements related to operations

    the companys principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available
under its revolving credit facility 4071 million available as of march 6
2001 cash generated from operations and cash generated from the sale of used
equipment for additional information concerning the companys credit facility
the credit facility see certain information concerning the credit
facility and other indebtednesscredit facility

    the company expects that its principal needs for cash relating to its
existing operations over the next 12 months will be to fund i operating
activities and working capital ii the purchase of rental equipment and
inventory items offered for sale and iii debt service the company plans to
fund such cash requirements relating to its existing operations from its
existing sources of cash described above

    the company estimates that equipment expenditures over the next 12 months
will be approximately 400 million for the existing operations of the company
these expenditures are comprised of approximately i 150 million of
expenditures in order to replace rental equipment sold ii 200 million of
discretionary expenditures to increase the size of the companys rental fleet
and iii 50 million of expenditures for the purchase of nonrental equipment
the company expects that it will fund such expenditures from a combination of
approximately 100 million of proceeds expected to be generated from the sale
of used equipment cash generated from operations and if required borrowings
available under the credit facility

    while emphasizing internal growth the company may also continue to expand
through a disciplined acquisition program the company expects to pay for
future acquisitions using cash capital stock notes andor assumption of
indebtedness to the extent that the companys existing sources of cash
described above are not sufficient to fund such future acquisitions the
company will require additional financing and consequently the companys
indebtedness may increase as the company implements its growth strategy there
can be no assurance however that any additional financing will be available
or if available will be on terms satisfactory to the company

    based upon the terms of the companys currently outstanding indebtedness
the company is scheduled to repay debt principal of approximately 338 million
during 2001

    certain measures to reduce cash requirements

focusing on measures to cut costs and reduce cash outlays some of the
principal initiatives are discussed below

    reduce equipment purchases and supplement new equipment with used
equipment the company as described above has budgeted 400 million for
rental and other equipment expenditures over the next 12 months this reflects
a significant reduction from the 962 million that was expended in 2000


                                      16
page

    the company believes that it may have the opportunity to purchase
latemodel used equipment at attractive prices accordingly while continuing
to purchase new equipment the company will also selectively purchase
latemodel used equipment the company estimates that over the next 12 months
used equipment will account for 1520 of its total equipment purchases

    the company plans to reduce the rate at which it invests in new equipment
in 2001 which will cause the weighted average age of its fleet to increase
from approximately 26 months to approximately 32 months the company believes
that because of the young age of its fleet the companys operations will not
be adversely affected by this six month increase in average age the company
also plans to reduce the rate at which it sells its used rental equipment in
2001 and as a result revenues from the sale of rental equipment are expected
to be 7075 lower in 2001 than in 2000

    close or consolidate underperforming branches the company is in the
process of reviewing underperforming branches and expects that over the next
several months a number of locations will be closed or consolidated with
existing locations

    continue to consolidate suppliers the company reduced the number of its
primary equipment suppliers from 111 to 28 in 2000 this allowed the company to
lower its purchase costs by approximately 150 million in 2000 and should
enable the company to save additional amounts in 2001 the company is currently
in the process of similarly consolidating its merchandise suppliers

    other costcutting measures the company is seeking to reduce costs in a
number of other ways including reducing administrative expenses consolidating
credit and collection centers and streamlining advertising

certain projected charges

    branch consolidation

    the company as described above expects that over the next several months
a number of underperforming locations will be closed or consolidated with other
locations the company estimates that as a result it will incur a pretax
charge in 2001 in the range of 20 million to 40 million primarily relating
to employee severance and vacating facilities

    debt refinancing

    the company is currently negotiating with various lenders to replace its
existing credit facility and term loans if this refinancing is completed the
company estimates that it would record a pretax extraordinary charge in 2001 in
the range of 16 million to 27 million primarily relating to the writeoff of
financing fees

fluctuations in operating results

    the company expects that its revenues and operating results may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter or over the longer term certain of the general factors
that may cause such fluctuations are discussed under factors that may
influence future results and accuracy of forward looking
statementsfluctuations of operating results in addition information
concerning certain projected charges that may impact quarterly results over the
near term is set forth under certain projected charges

    the company is continually involved in the investigation and evaluation of
potential acquisitions in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states the company capitalizes certain direct
outofpocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to
potential or pending acquisitions indirect acquisition costs such as
executive salaries general corporate overhead public affairs and other
corporate services are expensed as incurred the companys policy is to charge
against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or
pending acquisition that the company determines will not be consummated there
can be no assurance that the company in future periods will not be required to
incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy which charge
depending upon the magnitude thereof could adversely affect the companys
results of operations

    the company will be required to incur significant startup expenses in
connection with establishing each startup location such expenses may include
among others preopening expenses related to setting up the facility and
expenses in connection with training employees installing information systems
and marketing the company expects that in general startup locations will
initially operate at a loss or at less than normalized profit levels
consequently the opening of a startup location may negatively impact the
companys margins until the location achieves normalized profitability

                                      21
page

    there may be a lag between the time that the company purchases new
equipment and begins to incur the related depreciation and interest expenses
and the time that the equipment begins to generate revenues at normalized
rates as a result the purchase of new equipment particularly equipment
purchased in connection with expanding and diversifying the companys rental
equipment may periodically reduce margins

seasonality

    the companys business is seasonal with demand for the companys rental
equipment tending to be lower in the winter months the seasonality of the
companys business has been heightened by the companys acquisition of
businesses that specialize in renting traffic control equipment these
businesses tend to generate most of their revenues and profits in the second
and third quarters of the year slow down during the fourth quarter and operate
at a loss during the first quarter

inflation

    although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation
on its operations the company believes that inflation has not had and is not
likely in the foreseeable future to have a material impact on its results of
operations

impact of recently issued accounting standards

    in june 1999 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 137 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activitiesdeferral of the effective date
of fasb statement no 133 this standard delays the effective date of sfas no
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for one
year to fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 sfas no 133 establishes a
new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities the adoption
of sfas no 133 on january 1 2001 is not expected to have a material effect on
the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations

    in june 2000 the fasb issued sfas no 138 accounting for certain
derivative instruments and certain hedging activities this standard amends
sfas no 133 and addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation
difficulties the company will adopt sfas no 138 on january 1 2001 and it is
not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial
position or results of operations

    in september 2000 the fasb issued sfas no 140 accounting for transfers
and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilitiesa
replacement of fasb statement no 125 this standard revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires certain disclosures this standard is effective for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities
occurring after march 31 2001 and for disclosures relating to securitization
transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december 15 2000
the adoption of sfas no 140 is not expected to have a material effect on the
companys consolidated financial position or results of operations

factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forwardlooking
statements

    sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities

    our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and
industrial activities consequently a downturn in construction or industrial
activity may lead to a decrease in demand for

                                      22
page

our equipment which could adversely affect our business we have identified
below certain of the factors which may cause such a downturn either
temporarily or longterm

       the recent slowdown of the economy worsens or continues over the
        longterm

       an increase in interest rates or

       adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular
        region

    in addition demand for our traffic control equipment may not reach
projected levels in the event that funding for highway and other construction
projects under government programs such as the transportation equity act for
the 21st century tea21 does not reach expected levels

    fluctuations of operating results

    we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors
including

       seasonal rental patterns of our customerswith rental activity tending
        to be lower in the winter

       our recent acquisitions of businesses that specialize in renting
        traffic control equipment which tend to operate at a loss during the
        first quarter

       the timing of expenditures for new equipment and the disposition of
        used equipment

       changes in demand for our equipment or the prices therefor due to
        changes in economic conditions competition or other factors

       changes in the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt

       if we determine that a potential acquisition will not be consummated
        the need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to such
        transaction such as financing commitment fees merger and acquisition
        advisory fees and professional fees previously capitalized and

       the possible need from time to time to take other writeoffs or
        special charges due to a variety of occurrences such as store
        consolidations or closings or the refinancing of existing indebtedness

    dependence on additional capital

    we may require additional capital for among other purposes purchasing
rental equipment completing acquisitions and establishing new rental
locations if the cash that we generate from our business together with cash
that we may borrow under our credit facility is not sufficient to fund our
capital requirements we will require additional debt andor equity financing
we cannot however be certain that any additional financing will be available
or if available will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us if we
are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future our business
could be adversely affected

    certain risks relating to acquisitions

    the making of acquisitions entails certain risks including

       acquired companies could have unrecorded liabilities that we fail to
        discover during our due diligence investigations

                                      23
page

       we may have difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of
        the acquired company with our existing operations

       we may lose key employees of the acquired company and

       we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls
        procedures and policies

    dependence on management

    we are highly dependent upon our senior management team consequently our
business could be adversely affected in the event that we lose the services of
any member of senior management furthermore if we lose the services of
certain members of senior management it is an event of default under the
agreements governing our credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness
unless we appoint replacement officers satisfactory to the lenders within 30
days we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to members of
senior management

    competition

    the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive our
competitors primarily include small independent businesses with one or two
rental locations regional competitors which operate in one or more states
public companies or divisions of public companies and equipment vendors and
dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers we may in the
future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from
new companies in addition certain equipment manufacturers may commence or
increase their existing efforts relating to renting and selling equipment
directly to our customers

    liability and insurance

    we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business these
include claims relating to 1 personal injury or death caused by equipment
rented or sold by us 2 motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and
service personnel and 3 employment related claims we carry a broad range of
insurance for the protection of our assets and operations however such
insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons including

       our coverage is subject to a deductible of 10 million and limited to
        a maximum of 98 million per occurrence

       we do not maintain coverage for environmental liability since we
        believe that the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit
        that it provides and

       certain types of claims such as claims for punitive damages or for
        damages arising from intentional misconduct which are often alleged in
        third party lawsuits might not be covered by our insurance

    we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on
economically reasonable terms if at all

    environmental and safety regulations

    there are numerous federal state and local laws and regulations governing
environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters these
include laws and regulations that govern wastewater discharges the use
treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials
air quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of
hazardous substances under these laws an owner or lessee of real estate may
be liable for among other things

                                      24
page

1 the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances
located on in or emanating from the real estate as well as related costs of
investigation and property damage and substantial penalties and 2
environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has been
disposed these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or lessee
knew of the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not
the owner or lessee was responsible for these substances our activities that
are or may be affected by these laws include our use of hazardous materials to
clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of solid and hazardous waste and
wastewater from equipment washing we also dispense petroleum products from
underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain rental locations
and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to comply with applicable laws
furthermore we have acquired or lease certain locations which have or may have
been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other sources and are in
the process of assessing the nature of the required remediation based on the
conditions currently known to us we believe that any unreserved environmental
remediation and compliance costs required with respect to those conditions will
not have a material adverse effect on our business however we cannot be
certain that we will not identify adverse environmental conditions that are not
currently known to us that all potential releases from underground storage
tanks removed in the past have been identified or that environmental and
safety requirements will not become more stringent or be interpreted and
applied more stringently in the future if we are required to incur
environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently
anticipated by us our business could be adversely affected depending on the
magnitude of the cost

    risks related to international operations

    our operations outside the united states are subject to risks normally
associated with international operations these include the need to convert
currencies which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in
exchange rates and the need to comply with foreign laws

    dependence on information technology systems

    our ability to monitor and control our operations depends to a large extent
on the proper functioning of our information technology systems any disruption
in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could
depending on the magnitude and duration of the problem adversely affect our
business

    labor matters

    certain of our employees are represented by unions and covered by
collective bargaining agreements if we should experience a prolonged labor
dispute involving a significant number of our employees our business could be
adversely affected

    restrictive covenants

    the agreements governing our existing longterm indebtedness contain and
future agreements governing our longterm indebtedness may also contain
certain restrictive financial and operating covenants which affect and in many
respects significantly limit or prohibit among other things our ability to
incur indebtedness make prepayments of certain indebtedness make investments
create liens make acquisitions sell assets and engage in mergers and
consolidations these covenants may significantly limit our operating and
financial flexibility



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

    our exposure to market risk primarily consists of 1 interest rate risk
associated with our variable rate debt and 2 foreign currency exchange rate
risk primarily associated with our canadian operations

                                      25
page

    interest rate risk the company periodically utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates at
december 31 2000 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swap
agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 2000 million the effect of
these agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to 875 on 2000
million of term loan b

    all borrowings under our 8275 million credit facility bear interest at a
variable rate of interest the outstanding indebtedness under the credit
facility was 3370 million as of december 31 2000 our other variable rate
debt primarily consists of a 2469 million term loan b a 7481 million term
loan c a 1981 term loan d and 1000 million of receivables securitization
described earlier the weighted average interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt as of december 31 2000 were i 78 for the credit
facility ii 880 for the term loan b iii 926 for the term loan c iv
918 for the term loan d and v 744 for the receivables securitization
described earlier based upon the amount of variable debt that we had
outstanding as of december 31 2000 approximately 163 billion in the
aggregate our net income would decrease by approximately 95 million for
each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate
significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding
under the credit facility from time to time for additional information
concerning the terms of our variable rate debt see note 7 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein

    currency exchange risk the functional currency for our canadian operations
is the canadian dollar as a result our future earnings could be affected by
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars based
upon the current level of our canadian operations a 10 change in this
exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings in addition
the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its
transaction exposures at december 31 2000 the company had no outstanding
foreign exchange contracts the company does not engage in purchasing forward
exchange contracts for speculative purposes
