business 

vulcan materials compan y operates primarily in the us and is t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and a supplier of construction paving services  we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy delivered by trucks ships barges and trains our products are the indispensable materials building homes offices places of worship schools hospitals and factories as well as vital infrastructure including highways bridges roads ports and harbors water systems campuses dams airports and rail networks as of december 31 2021 we had 404 active aggregates facilities as shown below 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business as of december 31 2021 we further served our customers through our 69 asphalt facilities and 173 concrete facilities located in alabama arizona california maryland new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia the us virgin islands washington dc and the bahamas 

business strategy 

our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our strategy for longterm value creation is built on   1 an aggregates  focus ed business   2 a disciplined approach to growth management and capital allocation   3 a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability  4 a holistic approach to land management  and  5 our commitment to safety health and the environment  



1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist and significant barriers to entry exist in most markets vulcan is uniquely positioned as the largest aggregates supplier in the us and the most aggregatesfocused public company 

source 2020 reported financial information and company estimates vmc excludes us concrete which was acquired in august 2021 

given o ur focus on aggregates  we 

n take advantage of size and scale  while certain aspects of each aggregates operation are unique such as its location within a local market and its particular geological characteristics every operation uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service our 404 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2021 provide opportunities to share and scale best practices across our operations and to procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement technical support and engineering 

 build and hold substantial reserves  our reserves are critical to our longterm success we currently have 156 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations these restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 



2 growth management and capital allocation 

growth management  d emand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment as such w e have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and to divest assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy during the period 20 20  20 30  moodys analytics projects that 75  of the us population growth 72  of household formation and 70  of new jobs will occur in vulcanserved state s o ur coasttocoast footprint serves 20 of the top 25 highestgrowth metropolitan statistical areas in 22 states plus the us virgin islands and washington dc th e close proximity of our a ggregates reserve s and our p roduction facilitie s to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in highreturn projects 

source moody’s analytics as of december 10 2021 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 88 of our 2021 revenues while our top five accounted for 61 





since becoming a public company in 1956 vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc expanding our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other midatlantic and southeastern states in 2017 we acquired aggregates usa greatly expanding our ability to serve customers in florida georgia and south carolina in 2021 we acquired us concrete enhancing and expanding our aggregatesled business in attractive growing metropolitan areas 

while an aggregatesfocused business we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability o ur downstream businesses asphalt and concrete use vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusivel y in 2017 we entered the asphalt market in tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in 2018 we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses through our 2021 acquisition of us concrete we entered the oklahoma new jersey new york pennsylvania and us virgin islands concrete markets and expanded our california texas and washington dc concrete markets 

a dditionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton aggregates and downstream acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth from 2019 to 2021 we invested over 17581 million in acquisitions as outlined in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

capital allocation  our longterm capital allocation strategy is focused on the following priorities 

 operating capital maintain and grow the value of our franchise 

 growth capital including greenfields and acquisitions 

 dividend growth with a keen focus on sustainability 

 return excess cash to shareholders primarily via share repurchases 

during 2021 we reinvested 4513 million into core operating  maintenance capital and internal growth capital in addition to 3622 million and 3841 million reinvested in 2020 and 2019 respectively these investments are fundamental actions that sustain and strengthen the business they improve the longerterm efficiency capacity and flexibility of our production and they support our strong commitment to superior customer service 

as illustrated below our annual return on invested capital roic decreased 01 percentage points 10 basis points in 2021 while adjusted ebitda increased 10 in 2021 net earnings attributable to vulcan increased 15 in 2021 invested capital also increased by 10 primarily as a result of the us concrete acquisition we remain committed to driving improvement in our roic through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management 





3 compounding improvement in profitability 

our focus on the following four strategic disciplines has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

 operational excellence — continuous and sustainable improvements in both our operating disciplines and our industryleading safety performance coupled with better asset utilization through improved availability and throughput leads to effective cost control 

 strategic sourcing — leveraging common practices and innovation leads to more time in our plants and with our suppliers to deliver the right parts and services at the right time and optimize the total cost of ownership 

 commercial excellence — clearly defined roles and responsibilities together with access to real time forwardlooking metrics lead to our sales teams spending less time on nonselling activities and more time responding to our customers’ needs 

 logistics innovation — partnering with our customers truck drivers and contractors to provide a bundled logistics solution with digital shipping records and onsite mobile visibility leads to streamlined scheduling speed and accuracy of delivery and efficient backoffice processes 

we manage these disciplines locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively as a result aggregates gross profit per ton has improved from 532 in 2019 to 581 in 2021 

4  la nd management 

with more than 240000 acres in our land portfolio a longterm holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success from premining to mining to reclamation we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land creating maximum value for the business our shareholders and our communities 

we are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development after mining our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs aquifer recharge basins public parks habitat mitigation banks wetlands productive farmland and residential and commercial developments in 2021 we sold previously mined land in southern california that we had reclaimed for commercial and retail development for net proceeds of 1823 million resulting in a pretax net gain of 1147 million 

because of the evolving needs of our communities we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete our work with state regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations 

5  safety health and the environment 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate 

our leadership recognized decades ago the significance and importance of leadership in the safety health and environmental areas the safety health and environmental affairs committee of our board of directors along with the full board has oversight responsibility for our environmental safety and health programs and results our safety health  environmental management committee made up of the senior leadership team along with other key senior personnel from crossfunctional operations and staff disciplines has the ongoing management responsibility for all of our safety health and environmental initiatives we are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another in 2021 we achieved an overall mine safety and health administration msha safety performance of 098 injuries per 200000 employee hours worked which is both industryleading and considered worldclass 

our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate we leveraged our charitable foundation and company funds to support food banks healthcare services childhood education remote learning programs and other initiatives designed to lessen the difficulties experienced in many of our communities our charitable foundation alone has provided more than 60 million in support over the past 20 years to essential charitable civic and educational organizations that strengthen and enrich our communities 



we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives our environmental stewardship commitment is designed to protect plant and animal species and habitats as well as the air we breathe the water we use and the planet we all share in all parts of our company from local operations to our corporate and regional offices to our international business and oceangoing shipping we are focused on ensuring that our operations are efficient in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable we are proud to maintain the third largest number of certified wildlife habitat sites of any industrial company in the us for 2021 in partnership with the international wildlife habitat council for a discussion of our energy management and greenhouse gas emissions initiatives see the climate change section later within this item 1 under other businessrelated items 

product lines 

our products are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals schools shopping centers factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives our communities and the economy we have four operating and reportable segments aggregates asphalt concrete and calcium organized around our principal product lines as of december 31 2021 we had 404 active aggregates facilities 69 asphalt facilities 173 concrete facilities and 1 calcium facility 

our 2021 total revenues and gross profit by segment are illustrated as follows calcium revenues and gross profit were less than one percent 



for actual amounts see note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we generally ship our products upon receipt of a purchase order or in some cases simply a price quote therefore we do not have a significant order backlog 

1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 

 as a base material underneath highways walkways airport runways parking lots and railroads 

 to aid in water filtration purification and erosion control 

 as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including 

 houses and apartments 

 roads bridges and parking lots 

 schools and hospitals 

 commercial buildings and retail space 

 sewer systems 

 power plants 

 airports and runways 



aggregates industry 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business include 

 location and transportation of reserves aggregates have a high weighttovalue ratio and in most cases must be produced near where they are used if not transportation can cost more than the materials rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials where practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive approximately 82 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck 

exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available highquality aggregates we serve these markets from quarries that have access to costeffective longhaul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on mexico’s yucatan peninsula with our fleet of panamaxclass selfunloading ships additionally as a result of our 2021 acquisition of us concrete we serve markets in california and hawaii from our quarry in british columbia canada by means of a longterm marine shipping agreement with csl americas a pproximately 17 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered by truck to the customer after reaching a sales yard by rail or water the remaining 1 of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 

 limited product substitution there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lowercost alternative to virgin aggregates however many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet technical specifications and performancebased criteria for durability strength and other qualities likewise the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications 

 highly fragmented industry the us aggregates industry is composed of over 5500 companies that manage close to 11000 operations this fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities 

through strategic acquisitions and investments we have developed an unmatched coasttocoast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers we have over 20000 customers in 22 states the us virgin islands washington dc the bahamas british columbia canada and quintana roo mexico 

 flexible production capabilities the production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and through a series of screens separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used direct production costs of aggregates primarily include a wages and fringe benefits b depreciation depletion accretion and amortization of capital or longterm assets c operating parts and supplies d repair and maintenance e outside services and f energy primarily electricity and diesel production capacity is flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale when additional growth materializes 

 raw material inputs largely controlled unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves stone sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources however production does require the use of explosives hydrocarbon fuels and electric power 

 demand cycles longterm growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population jobs and households while shortterm and mediumterm demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries 

the drivers underpinning longterm demand and sustained pricing growth remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy they include population growth gains in total employment shortterm disruption due to covid19 pandemic and in household income and wages a continuing increase in household formations the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand a multiyear federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels stable state tax receipts public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the longterm trendline and a multiyear federal infrastructure investment law and continued political awareness and focus on the need to invest in infrastructure 



aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatelyfunded construction and it generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publiclyfunded projects particularly highways roads and bridges which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

‎ source company estimates 



public sector construction market 

public sector construction includes spending by federal stat e and local governments for highways bridges buildings airports schools prisons sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2021 publiclyfunded construction accounted for approximately 42 of our total aggregates shipments and approximately 22 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 

 public sector funding generally public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multiyear laws which provide certainty in funding amounts program structures rules and regulations federal spending is governed by authorization budget and appropriations laws the level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies 

 state and local transportation funding since 2012 32 states have increased or adjusted taxes on motor fuel to increase revenues available for transportation investment most recently in 2020 the virginia legislature raised its statewide gas tax and voters in arkansas renewed a ½ cent sales tax measure originally approved in 2012 to provide significant revenue for highway construction and maintenance through motor fuel tax increases other states have increased revenues outside of fuel taxes or made onetime increases since 2012 eleven vulcanserved states representing 88 of our 2021 total revenues have averaged a 69 increase in their states’ revenues for highways 

several states also index their gas taxes to a measure of inflation including alabama california florida georgia illinois maryland and north carolina 

in addition we benefit from state and local transportation funding ballot measures across the us voters in 17 states approved 87 of 323 measures in 2021 which will generate 76 billion in new and recurring transportation investment this continues a trend in which voters have approved 84 of 2608 transportation investment ballot measures since 2010 major transportation funding measures in vulcanserved areas approved in 2021 are estimated to result in 33 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads streets and bridges 

 federal highway funding  in november 2021 president biden signed a historic bipartisan infrastructure bill the infrastructure investment and jobs act iija into law 

the iija provides the largest increase in federal highway road and bridge funding in more than six decades with a fiveyear reauthorization of federalaid highway program funding the total federalaid highway program obligation limitation under iija starts at 669 billion in ffy 2022 and increases to 721 billion in ffy 2026 for a total of nearly 350 billion 

these numbers include onetime additional funding for large road and bridge projects such as 40 billion for bridge repair replacement and rehabilitation of the bridge money approximately 165 billion is earmarked for projects in vulcanserved states 

the longterm nature of the highway program reauthorization in the iija is important the federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 50 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects in states where we operate we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with iija and policy implementation 

importantly building on improvements in the two prior reauthorization laws — the fixing america’s surface transportation act fast act and moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 — the iija further streamlines project delivery and environmental approval advancements 

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending the iija expands access to private activity bonds for highway and intermodal projects and sets the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program authorized at 250 million per year 



 additional federal infrastucture investments under the iija the iija allocates a total of approximately 12 trillion in federal funds for infrastructure investment including almost 550 billion in new spending a little more than half of the new money is dedicated to transportation sector projects beyond highway infrastructure vulcan could benefit from iijafunded aggregatesintensive infrastructure projects such as railroads airports seaports and drinking and wastewater systems 

 federal water resources infrastructure in december 2020 president trump signed the water resources development act of 2020 wrda 2020 into law enacting the fourth consecutive biennial authorization for the us army corps of engineers army corps since 2014 wrda 2020 reauthorizes needed investment in america’s ports channels locks dams and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities it also improves the united states environmental protection agency’s epa programs for storm water water recycling and sewer overflow projects the ffy 2021 appropriations for the army corps also passed as part of the yearend legislative package funds for the first time the army corps water infrastructure financing program cwifp which was authorized in the water resources reform and development act of 2014 wrrda 2014 modeled after the highly popular tifia program in the surface transportation sector cwifp will accelerate nonfederal investments in water resources infrastructure by providing longterm lowcost loans to creditworthy borrowers 

p rivate sector construction market 

the private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction in 2021 privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 58 of our total aggregates shipments 

 nonresidential construction private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends the growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals places of worship and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firms ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing this end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 

 residential construction household formations in vulcanserved states continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the united states the majority of residential construction is for singlefamily housing with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor 

us housing starts as measured by dodge data  analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2021 total annual housing starts in the us reached 175 million units 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad tracks we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico and our quarry in british columbia canada nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate attractive financial returns and enhance financial returns in our core aggregates segment  we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete within each of our three geographic markets as noted below we also provide construction paving services included in our asphalt segment in alabama tennessee and texas 

aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 



2 asphalt 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in alabama arizona california new mexico tennessee and texas in october 2020 we strengthened our asphalt position in texas by acquiring additional asphalt operations for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segme nt relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement which we purchase from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities 

3 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california maryland new jersey new york oklahoma pennsylvania texas virginia the us virgin islands and washington dc in august 2021 through our acquisition of us concrete we entered the new jersey new york oklahoma pennsylvania and us virgin islands concrete markets and expanded our service of the california texas and washington dc concrete markets in april 2020 we exited the new mexico readymixed concrete market we retained the concrete plants and mobile fleet which are leased to the buyer and obtained a 20year aggregates supply agreement in october 2019 we expanded our readymixed concrete operations in virginia via an acquisition for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations readymixed concrete consists of cement and other cementrelated materials such as fly ash and slag aggregates crushed stone and sand chemical admixtures and water and is measured in cubic yards aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

cement is the binding agent used to bind water crushed stone and sand in the production of readymixed concrete other industrial byproducts such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume have cementrelated properties that allow them to be used as substitutes for cement depending on the specifications we purchase cementrelated materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements 

with the exception of chemical admixtures each readymix facility typically maintains an inventory level of these raw materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods we generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand 

because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility readymixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third party producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck 

4 calcium 

our calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t industries with high  quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 



other businessrelated items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 

competitors 

we operate in a fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers accounted for 33 of the total us aggregates production in 2021 despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 exclusive of our recent us concrete acquisition other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 

 arcosa inc 

 cemex sab de cv 

 crh plc 

 heidelbergcement ag 

 holcim 

 martin marietta materials inc 

 summit materials inc 

because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5500 companies managing close to 11000 operations during 2021  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 2021 our five largest customers accounted for 8 of our total revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total revenues although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publiclyfunded construction such as highways airports and government buildings a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publiclyfunded construction the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local state or federal governments in addition our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coasttocoast ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers 



climate change 

climate change or longterm changes in global temperature and other characteristics of the atmosphere is a global concern impacts of climate change are seen in the forms of increased global temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts heat waves wildfires and storms which can destroy habitats affect livelihoods and communities and disrupt the economy these severe impacts have been felt across our footprint as exemplified by the recent drought wildfires and flooding in california the number and severity of hurricanes in our gulf coast states and flooding in our midatlantic states 

the united nations climate change conference in glasgow cop26 stressed the urgency of taking action to keep global temperature from exceeding 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels due to human influence on the climate from carbonbased energy use and unsustainable natural resource management the earth is now about 11 degrees celsius warmer than it was in the 1800s 

vulcan’s carbon footprint is small in 2021  our total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ghg emissions were 11 million tons of co 2 e on a peroperation basis our industrial operations are well below the epa’s threshold for reporting and permitting of ghg emissions even with this small footpri nt b eginning in 2018 vulcan chose to report ghg emissions via the carbon disclosure project in 2022 we will establish goals and targets related to scope 1 and 2 emissions and will calculate our scope 3 emissions whic h r esult from a ctivities of assets not owned or controlled by vulcan but that we indirectly impact in our value chain we intend to disclose sciencebased targets aligned with holding warming to 15 degrees celsius in 2023 

as an industry leader we are committed to doing our part to strengthen the sustainability of our products and operations and to reduce our impact on the environment through initiatives that favorably impact climate change  such as  managing energy and operational efficiency to reduce ghg emissions and recycling 

 managing energy and operational efficiency to reduce ghg emissions environmental stewardship — including our efforts to manage energy and increase efficiencies — is embedded into our business strategy and culture energy management operational efficiency and the purchase of renewable energy have reduced our scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions per ton of production and per dollar of revenue compared to 2015 as noted below 





we manage energy use carefully we routinely conduct energy audits of our operations to identify areas for operational efficiency improvements and energy savings some of the opportunities identified during these audits that are being implemented include replacement of older motors with new ultrahigh efficiency motors to power plant processing equipment improvements in water handling systems to reduce water pumping needed optimizing process equipment flow to maximize efficiency use of led lighting and optimization of air conditioning and lighting control to reduce energy consumption 

we continue to increase the fuel efficiencies of our offroad fleet vehicles tier iv machines performed over 50 of the offroad fleet’s work in 2021 which positively impacts all air emissions in addition to having an impact on ghg emissions 

additionally our concrete segment has licensed the carboncure technology that provides capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide within readymixed concrete the carbon dioxide becomes chemically bound within the concrete matrix and is not released into the air even when the concrete is recycled following use this technology also reduces the demand for cement and other cementrelated materials which reduces the supply side carbon footprint the resulting concrete is also stronger than it would have been without use of the technology 



we are actively assessing the scope and scale of potential opportunities to reduce future ghg emissions future scope 1 and scope 2 reductions will come by means of continuing heavy equipment replacement with higher efficiency models seeking production efficiencies and procuring energy from renewable sources 

we are confident that there are many more opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations distribution and transport networks and the projects in which our products are used an example of an additional opportunity that we are exploring is the installation of battery storage for electricity at multiple locations so that energy can be stored during off peak periods to run the plant equipment thereby minimizing peak load usage this has significant implications for the ability of the utility company to meet peak demands and to reduce their use of older power plants that burn coal or oil and emit greater concentrations of ghg emissions 

 recycling ensuring proper management of waste materials to prevent the release of contaminants to the environment is good environmental stewardship and good risk management recycling of certain items also reduces our impact on climate change since 2017 we have recycled more than 19 million gallons of used oil including 04 million gallons in 2021 resulting in both a cost savings to us and a reduction in the amount of new fossil fuels required 

the recycling of aggregatescontaining construction materials including concrete and recycled asphalt pavement rap is an important part of our business the sources of these materials are highway and infrastructure projects and other demolition projects where concrete structures or asphalt paving is being removed 

 rap is used as a supplemental feedstock for the asphalt plants as it provides quality aggregates and valuable heat content from asphaltic cement to replace some of the virgin aggregates and asphaltic cement asphalt oil that would otherwise be used — during 2021 we reused 17 million tons of rap 

 concrete is reprocessed through crushing and screening plants to produce aggregatescontaining recycled concrete products — during 2021 we recycled 24 million tons of concrete 

the recycling of these aggregatescontaining construction materials reduces carbon emissions that impact climate change while providing a valuable service to our customers and communities extending the life of our aggregates reserves and helping us manage the cost of production 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the communities where we conduct business compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the time and effort of our employees as well as financial resources the following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business for additional information about our risks related to government regulations see item 1a “risk factors” 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety including regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration msha and occupational safety and health administration osha compliance with these various regulations requires capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs these anticipated investments and expenditures are not material to our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share of that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 



frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded at fair value in our financial statements at the time the obligation arises to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about environmental matters and reclamation obligations see notes 12 and 17 respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

human capital 

as of january 1 2022 we employed 11437 people in the united states of these employees 1602 are represented by labor unions also as of that date we employed 401 people in mexico 73 people in canada and 1 person in the bahamas and of these employees 325 are represented by labor unions we have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage in the past 10 years and we do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2022 

vulcan’s commitment to our people has played a key role in the ongoing success and growth of our company throughout our long history we are dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect integrity teamwork and trust among our workforce our people share a competitive drive to be the best they can be and do the right thing which benefits all our stakeholders 

diversity and inclusion are important values at vulcan  our continued investment in people and strong commitment to diversity and inclusion will help us attract grow and retain the best talent possible in 2015 we escalated and formalized our efforts in this area with the launch of our diversity and inclusion council to promote an open workplace where everyone regardless of background race or other factors is free to contribute and grow in 2019 we signed the ceo action for diversity  inclusion tm pledge and we forged a longterm partnership with historically black colleges and universities hbcus to support our future leaders in our communities and on our team in 2020 we established diversity and inclusion di councils in our divisions to support targeted di opportunities in their local communities in 2021 we launched employee resource groups ergs and included quarterly di topics and updates in our vulcan university popup training series 

diversity and inclusion is also part of employee training all employees completed di awareness training in 2016 all new hires complete di awareness training within their first 90 days the unconscious bias training launched in 2021 will be completed by all employees by the end of 2022 

as a result of our commitment to diversity and inclusion we have 

 cultivated a diverse talent pipeline of next generation leaders through our operationssales trainee program 

 expanded the diversity of our workforce at middle management and higher levels 

 increased the number of female hires and promotions in senior leadership roles 

 developed a fiveyear strategy through our diversity and inclusion council 

 built partnerships with hbcus to recruit talented minority students for internships and management training roles 

our board of directors is 36 diverse three board members are women and one board member is black and we earned recognition in 2017 by 2020 women on boards for having 20 or more of our board seats held by women 

we believe that learning is fundamental to every job and we encourage our people to expand and explore their capabilities for continued growth our industryleading training and development programs encourage collaboration and enable people to innovate and flourish on the job and in the community these programs 

 provide our employees with a tuition reimbursement program which pays up to 100 of tuition costs based on academic performance 

 encourage personal and professional growth through our mentoring program which has graduated more than 1906 employees 

 prepare future seniorlevel leaders through our leadership 2022 series in partnership with the university of north carolina chapel hill 

 offer mini mba programs and other continuing education opportunities

risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

economicpolitical risks 

our business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles — our products are principally sold to the us construction industry because our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets our profits are sensitive to the underlying national regional and local economic conditions construction spending which is cyclical is affected by general economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic shifts industry cycles employment levels inflation and other business economic and financial factors that are beyond our control a downturn in construction activities or spending in vulcanserved markets particularly in our top revenuegenerating markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a pandemic epidemic or other public health emergency such as the ongoing coronavirus covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows — our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics epidemics or other public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic this pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing or reimplementing strict measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments school closures and other measures in addition governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and may take further action as circumstances warrant  

consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date we currently continue to operate across our footprint notwithstanding our continued operations and an economic environment that has shown signs of improvement the covid19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations supply chain transportation networks and customers which may lower our revenues and ebitda including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking the covid19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and services the progression of this matter has and may continue to negatively impact our business or results of operations by affecting the health of our employees and through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers the extent to which the covid19 outbreak impacts our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and geographic spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including the reimplementation of restrictions on economic activity following new outbreaks the availability durability and efficacy of vaccines the longterm impacts of the virus on transportation revenues government budgets and other funding priorities and the extent and pace at which normal economic and operating conditions can resume there can be no assurance that we will not be impacted by adverse consequences that may be brought about by pandemics on global financial markets which may reduce resources share prices and financial liquidity and may severely limit the availability of financing capital 



changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environment al an d other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations including those related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment create restrictions on our products impede our access to reserves or hamper the opening of new or expansion of existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure — our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments in 2021 voters in local jurisdictions in arizona georgia texas and virginia among others approved bond and revenueraising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects in 2020 virginia p assed new longterm highway funding legislation and voters in arkansas made permanent a ½ cent gas tax increase first approved in 2012  in november 2021 t he federal infrastructure investment and jobs act iija which included a five year road bridge and public transportation program reauthorization at record levels was signed into law the highway programs as well as funding for other aggregatesintensive public infrastructure will provide assistance to state departments of transportation federal state and local agencies and metro areas for several years to come however given the time to set up new federal programs varying state and local budgetary situations and the stages of projects we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities availability of water and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity a number of our facilities are located in desert climates and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of energy or water in the past we cannot guarantee that we will not in the future furthermore public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa we face political and other risks including legal risks for failure to comply with the fcpa associated with our international operations including our largest aggregates production facility located in playa del carmen mexico and our newly acquired aggregates production facility in british columbia canada these risks have included and may in the future include changes in international trade policies such as the united states  mexico  canada agreement usmca imposition of duties taxes or government royalties arbitrary changes to permits zoning classifications or operating agreements or overt acts by foreign governments including expropriations and other forms of takings of property recently the mexican government has taken actions that adversely affect our operations in that country including delays in issuing a historically routine threeyear customs permit for our deepwater port mexico instead issued a shortterm customs permit that must be renewed after two months while we continue to negotiate with the mexican authorities to reach an agreeable and mutually beneficial solution failure by the mexican government to issue future customs permits or its taking of any other measures that force us to cease our operations in mexico would have an adverse effect on our ability to supply customers 



growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrated therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas  if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations  if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs  therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipment volumes — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipment volumes 

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 2021 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact the cost andor availability of financing — we currently have 395 billion of debt with maturities between 2022 and 2048 we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investmentgrade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit ratings could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 



we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items  changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 goodwill impairment 

 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

 pension and other postretirement benefits 

 environmental compliance costs 

 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 income taxes 

these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

an increase in our effective tax rate could negatively affect our earnings and net cash provided by operating activities — factors that may increase our future effective tax rate include but are not limited to governmental authorities increasing statutory income tax rates or eliminating deductions or credits the mix of jurisdictions in which our earnings are taxed changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the effect our stock price has with regard to excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various income tax returns the resolution of issues arising from income tax audits with various tax authorities and the interpretation of income tax laws andor administrative practices 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations — labor unions represent approximately 16 of our workforce disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs andor reduced revenues 

general risk factors 

a significant interruption of our information technology systems our own and that of our service providers such as amazon web services or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data whether our own our employees’ our suppliers’ or our customers’ could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results — we have a dedicated information security team that executes and updates as warranted based on emerging risk and new risk management technology our information security program the audit committee which has oversight responsibility for our information security program is briefed on such program at least twice annually and our chief financial officer is briefed on such program at least quarterly while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology and routinely test the security of our information systems network we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 



o ur products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers  significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs  truckrailcarbarge shortages truck driver and rail crew shortages capacity constraint s and minimum tonnage requirements additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation  which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resource s a nd our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability  variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

aggregates resources and reserves calculations are estimates only and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the inherent variability of the deposit and recoverability of saleable material in the mining process — the calculation of mineral resources and reserves are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis which may prove to be unpredictable until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed the quantity must be considered as an estimate only 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of a chemical s b usines s  although we divested the chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingenc y a nd could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — w e operate construction paving businesses in alabama tennessee and texas in some instances including many of our fixed price paving contracts we agree to complete a project by a certain date if we fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay consequently the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites that we own or owned where we operate or have operated or where we sent materials for recycling or disposal as well as related offsite investigations and cleanups as required by gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

properties 

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier o f construction aggregates we have mining properties across the us and in the bahamas canada and mexico we principally serve markets in twentytwo states the us virgin islands washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in british columbia canada and quintana roo mexico our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

our mining properties are categorized as follows 1 production stage – properties with reported proven or probable reserves where we are actively mining aggregates 2 development stage – properties with reported proven or probable reserves where we are not actively mining aggregates and 3 exploration stage – properties with no reported reserves the following map illustrates the location of our 228 aggregates production stage properties and 71 development stage properties  our 34 aggregates exploration stage properties are excluded from this map 

active aggregates facilities generally include one or more scale house s office building s  maintenance shop s and processing plant s 



our aggregates resources and reserves are our foundation and fundamental to our success however no individual mining property is individually material to our business as of december 31 2021 we directly operated substantially all of our aggregates production facilities 

our aggregates resources and reserves estimates are calculated in accordance with subpart 1300 of regulation sk under the exchange act our proven and probable aggregates reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding aggregates reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries we conduct ongoing studies of our deposits to optimize economic values and to manage risk 

we revise our mine plans and estimates of proven and probable aggregates reserves as required and in accordance with the latest available studies once mine plans are initially established the ongoing viability of the plan is reviewed regularly with the benefit of hindsight discussions between mine planning operations and management determine the need for adjustments additional resources drilling information or other key information while construction aggregates reserves and resources are relatively consistent conditions can change with time that require a newly tailored solution examples of changes include fluctuations in physical or chemical parameters of the product sales product shifts overburden removal or placement management structural changes entitlement changes and land additions 

our estimates of proven and probable aggregates reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees the methodology employed takes a systematic approach to collecting sufficient information to estimate the reserves and resources each of our reserve and resource bearing properties is evaluated with supporting information to identify its geological mining and economic viability the supporting information includes aerial photography topography geologic maps aggregates rock quality information including core drilling hand samples and bulk sample testing andor geophysical data hydrology archaeology biology property boundary information zoning information relevant municipal and environmental permitting information the information is collected by experienced mining engineers and geologists who determine the extent of a resource using a combination of methods including ordinary planimetric based measurements to computer aided design 3dimensional models 

the results of the supporting information are reviewed by various levels of management including our “qualified person” as defined by subpart 1300 this qualified person then verifies that the information adheres to regulatory mandated quantification methods the economic viability of our reserves is evaluated taking into account historical performance of relevant operations and sales forecasts among other factors 

measurements of our proven and probable aggregates reserves have inherent risks these risks include the accuracy and completeness of geologic information the interpretation of the data operational execution market shifts structural events and the uncertainty of uncovered material management and the qualified person work together to assess these risks regularly and amend the reserves assessments with new information as appropriate new information can yield site changes that require capital expenditures or cause production performance changes that have financial impacts 



aggregates resources 

mineral resources are defined as a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for its economic extraction mineral resources are classified into three categories in decreasing level of confidence as follows 

 measured — based on conclusive geological evidence and sampling meaning that evidence is sufficient to test and confirm geological and grade or quality continuity after applying modifying factors as noted in the aggregates reserves section below measured resources may be converted to either proven or probable reserves 

 indicated — based on adequate geological evidence and sampling meaning that evidence is sufficient to establish geological and grade or quality continuity with reasonable certainty after applying modifying factors indicated resources may be converted to probable reserves 

 inferred — based on limited geological evidence and sampling meaning that evidence is only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity is more likely than not inferred resources may not be converted to reserves 

our reported aggregates resources do not include amounts that have been identified as mineral reserve s our 2021 measured indicated and inferred aggregates resources are based on an initial assessment using an average sales price assumption ranging from  500 to  2000 per ton depending on the locationmarket the table below presents by division the tons of measured indicated and inferred aggregates resources and the percentage of aggregates resources by commodity as of december 31 2021 







aggregates reserves 

mineral reserves are defined as the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource mineral reserves are classified into two categories in decreasing level of confidence as follows 

 proven — those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 

 probable — those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under leas e a nd for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained through permit contract or grandfathered status  w e a pply modifying factors to establish the economic viability of the reserves as follows 

 contractual and governmental regulations for example leases zoning permits and reclamation plans often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions 

 technical and economic factors affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable 

 mining and processing waste are also factored in our computations for proven and probable reserves 

our 2021 proven and probable aggregates reserves were estimated by internal experts ie geologists or engineers the economic viability of our reserves were determined using average aggregates prices ranging from 500 to 2000 per ton depending on the locationmarket 



the tables below present by reserve classification — proven probable and total proven  probable pp — and by division the tons of aggregates reserves as of december 31 2021 and the percentages by commodity type the third proven  probable table also notes the 2021 production 











our current estimate of 156 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects a decrease of 03 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  approximately 03 b illion tons were added as a result of 2021 acquisitions es timates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

of the 156 billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2021 132 billion tons or 86 are located on production stage properties and 22 billion tons or 14 are located on development stage properties we do not report aggregates reserves for exploration stage sites 

of the 156 billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 2021 91 billion tons or 58 are located on owned land and 65 billion tons or 42 are located on leased land our land portfolio consists of more than 240000 acres 

in addition to our aggregates mining properties we operate aggregates sales yards and recycled concrete plants the table below presents by division the count of active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2021 and the types of facilities operated 







asphalt concrete and calcium 

as of december 31 2021 we o perate d a number of facilities producing asphalt mix readymixed concrete and calcium in several of our divisions as reflected in the table below  





the asphalt and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials 

our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida that provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  the brooksville quarry is not individually material to our business calcium resources and reserves are outlined in the tabl e below 







our production stage leased brooksville limestone quarry produces a supplement for enduse products such as animal feed and plastics high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse products the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 97 



headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space consists of approximately 184410 square feet and is leased through december 31 2038 the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is approximately  38 million

our teams finished the year strong despite ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures and labor constraints we expanded our industryleading unit profitability by continuing to focus on our operating disciplines and taking pricing actions where necessary to mitigate these headwinds we continue to make excellent progress integrating the us concrete operations into our business this acquisition extends our growth platform in certain existing markets as well as new geographies these results demonstrate our ability to execute on vulcan’s four strategic disciplines — operational excellence strategic sourcing commercial excellence and logistics innovation as outlined in item 1 “business” under the “business strategy” heading — and enhance our operating leverage moving forward we are well positioned to capitalize on the positive demand trends we see developing in 2022 and beyond 

as demand and the pricing environment continue to strengthen we expect healthy growth in unit profitability again in 2022 robust growth in aggregates pricing and continued focus on operational excellence will more than offset anticipated inflationary pressures in our asphalt business we expect recent pricing efforts to begin to mitigate higher liquid asphalt costs and lead to gross profit margin improvement beginning in the second half of 2022 in our concrete business improvement in private nonresidential construction activity will help drive earnings growth in 2022 

at year end 2021 total debt to adjusted ebitda was 27x 25x on a net debt basis we remain committed to our stated longterm target leverage range of 20x to 25x total debt to adjusted ebitda 

return on invested capital was 142 and we remain committed to driving further improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management 

capital allocation 

our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged through economic cycles we intend to balance reinvestment in our business growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility evidenced by our strong balance sheet and investmentgrade credit ratings our capital allocation priorities are as follows 

1 operating capital maintain and grow the value of our franchise 

2 growth capital including greenfields and acquisitions 

3 dividend growth with a keen focus on sustainability 

4 return excess cash to shareholders primarily via share repurchases 

our first priority is to maintain and protect our valuable franchise by keeping our operations in good working order to ensure the production of high quality materials and timely delivery of goods and services to our customers this capital r equiremen t expand s and contract s as production and shipment levels c hang e  during 2021 we invested  2817 millio n t o replace or improve existing property plant  equipment 

our second priority is to gro w o ur franchis e t hrough internal growth projects and business acquisitions  internal growth projects have generally been among our highest returning project s  during 2021  we invested  1696 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves develop new production andor distribution sites enhance our distribution capabilities and support the targeted growth of our asphalt and concrete operations for business acquisitions we tend to look fo r b olton acquisitions which are easy to integrate and will pursue large business combinations that are the right fit and the right price during august 2021 we closed on one such large business combination us concrete for 16345 million we use strategic and returnsbased criteria to price potential acquisitions and are disciplined in our approach we look at a lot of potential acquisitions and only make offers on a few we closed two business acquisitions including us concrete during 2021 for total consideration of 16394 million 

our third priority is growing the dividend with a keen focus on sustainability through the economic cycle during 2021 we paid a dividend per share of 148 and paid total dividends of 1964 million 

and finally if there is excess cash after fulfilling the prior capital allocation priorities we will consider returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases during 2021 we made no share repurchases 

for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



market developments and outlook 

we carry considerable momentum into the new year our markets are poised to outperform other parts of the country as demand continues to improve and our industryleading unit profitability increases with each passing quarter we will continue to drive substantial value through the combination of our legacy business and the acquisition of us concrete residential construction remains strong and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings are growing again on the public side infrastructure investment is moving forward and we are well positioned in attractive growth markets where the need is greatest the recently enacted infrastructure investment and jobs act is certainly a positive for our industry it will add to existing demand as well as elongate the cycle however we do not expect it to have a significant impact in 2022 that said labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are expected to continue to limit shipment growth in 2022 we expect the favorable pricing dynamics that improved throughout 2021 to be even better in 2022 and lead to attractive growth in aggregates unit profitability growing our aggregates unit profitability consistently during the last two years of pandemicrelated disruptions demonstrates the resiliency of our business and our ability to capitalize on any changes in the macro environment 

management expectations for 2022 include 

 net earnings attributable to vulcan of between 800 to 890 million 

 adjusted ebitda of between 1720 to 1820 million 

 high singledigit growth in aggregates cash gross profit per ton 743 in 2021 

 total shipment growth of 5 to 7 2229 million tons in 2021 

 freightadjusted price increase of 6 to 8 1487 per ton in 2021 

 midsingle digit increase in freightadjusted cash cost freightadjusted sales price less segment cash gross profit per ton 744 per ton in 2021 due to higher energyrelated costs mostly diesel fuel and continued inflationary pressures in other areas 

 cash gross profit of 300 to 325 million in asphalt concrete and calcium collectively 

 concrete segment expected to account for approximately 75 of the total due to a full year of results from us concrete operations as well as margin improvement in our legacy operations 

 asphalt segment earnings improvement driven by volume growth and price improvement higher prices for asphalt mix in the second half of 2022 are expected to reduce the earnings impact of higher liquid asphalt costs and natural gas used in production 

 sag expenses of 485 to 495 million including a full year of us concrete 

 interest expense of approximately 150 million 

 depreciation depletion accretion and amortization expense of approximately 540 million 

 an effective tax rate of 21 to 22 

as previously noted 2022 sales volumes may be affected by labor shortages and supply chain disruptions if these constraints do continue well into 2022 it is important to remember that the work is still there it may just proceed at a slower pace effectively extending the recovery and allowing us the opportunity to compound our unit margins 

additionally we expect to spend 600 million to 650 million on capital expenditures including growth and capacityadding projects we will continue to review our plans and will adjust as needed while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity 



competitive advantages 

aggregates footprint 

over time we have strategically and systematically built one of the most valuable aggregates franchises in the us with a footprint that is impossible to replicate zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries such regulations while curtailing expansion also increase the value of our reserves that were zoned and permitted decades ago 

demand for aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have a coasttocoast footprint that serves 20 of the top 25 highestgrowth metropolitan statistical areas msas and states where 75  of us population growth from 2020 to 2030 is projected to occur as state and federal spending increases vulcan is poised to benefit greatly from growing private and public demand for aggregates thereby delivering significant longterm value for our shareholders

based on people added from 2020 to 2030 



compounding improvement in profitability 

we have continued to deliver strong financial performance over time and through business cycles through our aggregatesled strategy and focus on our four strategic disciplines — operational excellence strategic sourcing commercial excellence and logistics innovation as outlined in item 1 “business” under the “business strategy” heading — we have created one of the most profitable public companies in our industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale as markets continue to recover from the covid19 pandemic 

safety health and environmental performance 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate over our more than six decades as a public company we have built a strong resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way 

we are a leader in our industry in safety health and environmental performance with a safety record substantially better than the industry average we apply the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another the result is a record of safety excellence that consistently outperforms the industry 

source mine safety and health administration msha records and internal vulcan data 





we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives resulting in 986 citationfree inspections out of all 2021 federal and state environmental inspections as an industry leader our aim has always been to meet — and strive to exceed — all federal state and local environmental regulations however environmental sustainability means looking beyond what is required of a company by governments and regulators we continue to make progress on reducing our carbon footprint increasing our energy efficiency measuring and reducing our water use and managing our land with biodiversity in mind it’s the right thing to do for society for our business and our stakeholders 

our environmental stewardship commitment is designed to protect plant and animal species and habitats as well as the air we breathe the water we use and the planet we all share our environmental stewardship is reflected in our business strategy in all parts of our company from local operations to our corporate and regional offices to our international business and oceangoing shipping we are focused on ensuring that our operations are efficient in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable 

we lead community relations programs that serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate during 2021 we operated 40 certified wildlife habitat sites the third largest number of sites in the nation as certified by the wildlife habitat council we provided over 175 scholarships to students nationwide and emphasized covid19 support as well as diversity and inclusion in our community outreach and contributions 

we recognize that the aggregates mining in which we engage is an interim use of the more than 240000 acres of land in our portfolio our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses at the end of mining effective management throughout the life cycle of our land — from premining utilization as agriculture and timber development to postmining development as water reservoirs or residential and commercial development — not only generates significant additional value for our shareholders but greatly benefits the communities in which we operate 

strong financial foundation 

our financial position is strong as evidenced by our investmentgrade credit ratings fitch bbbmoody’s baa2standard  poor’s bbb at december 31 2021 our available liquidity was 11754 million including 2415 million of cash on hand significantly higher than our liquidity needs our leverage ratio as measured by total debt to adjusted ebitda has improved from 65x at december 31 2012 to 27x at december 31 2021 our net debt to adjusted ebitda at december 31 2021 was 25x nearly within our stated leverage target of 20 to 25x over that same period we also improved the structure of our debt average maturity from 7 years to 11 years and reduced the cost of the debt weighted average interest rate from 755 to 368 



customer service 

more than an aggregates supplier we are a business dedicated to customer service and finding creative solutions to meet our customers’ needs being a valued partner and trusted supplier means that we are providing the right product with the right specifications that is the right quality delivered the right way — on time and safely our onevulcan locally led approach in which our employees work together to leverage the size and strengths of vulcan as a whole while running their operations with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and sense of ownership allows us to deliver marketleading services to our customers 

transportation costs are passed along to our customers and because aggregates have a very high weighttovalue ratio those costs can add up quickly when transporting aggregates long distances having the most extensive distribution network of any aggregates producer sets us apart combining our trucking rail barge and ocean vessel shipping logistics capabilities allows us to provide better customer solutions and create a seamless customer experience at a competitive price  

as an approximation a truck has a capacity of 2025 tons of aggregates a railcar has a capacity of 45 truckloads a barge has a capacity of 65 truckloads and our ocean vessels have the capacity of 2500 truckloads 



results of operations 

total revenues are primarily derived from our product sales of aggregates asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and include freight  delivery costs that we pass along to our customers to deliver these products we also generate service revenues from our asphalt construction paving business and services related to our aggregates business we present separately our discontinued operations which consists of our former chemicals business 

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 





operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 asphalt 3 concrete and 4 calcium management reviews earnings for our reporting segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments 

 increased 7 in 2021 1 

 decreased 3 in 2020 

 increased 7 in 2019 



total aggregates shipments increased 7 5 on a samestore basis reflecting improving demand across most endmarkets 

our yearoveryear freightadjusted selling price 1 for aggregates 

 increased 30 in 2021 

 increased 32 in 2020 

 increased 56 in 2019 





as demand visibility improved the pricing environment continued to strengthen and the rate of pricing growth improved sequentially each quarter this year freightadjusted pricing increased 30 samestore increased 30 and samestore mixadjusted increased 32 with the growth widespread across geographies 





aggregates segment gross profit increased 12 to 12957 million or 581 per ton cash gross profit per ton improved 5 from the prior year to 743 the earnings improvement was widespread across our footprint and resulted from both volume and price growth as well as effective cost control this year’s results include a 107 million unfavorable impact from selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of the us concrete acquisition and a 414 million unfavorable impact from significantly higher diesel fuel costs 

on a samestore basis unit gross profit increased 7 to 595 per ton and cash gross profit per ton improved 5 from the prior year to 748 this improvement was driven by 5 samestore volume growth 30 price growth and an increase in freightadjusted cash costs of less than 1 despite a more than 50 increase in diesel fuel prices 

solid operational execution mostly offset higher costs for diesel fuel inflation for certain parts and supplies and operational disruptions caused by labor shortages freightadjusted unit cost of sales increased only 2 despite the significant increase in diesel fuel prices positive pricing opportunities and improved operating efficiencies are expected to continue to help offset some of the cost inflation going forward 



2 asphalt 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 

 decreased 4 in 2021 

 decreased 7 in 2020 

 increased 12 in 2019 

asphalt segment gross profit decreased from 752 million in the prior year to 212 million the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to sharply higher costs for liquid asphalt 412 million impact and a rise in natural gas prices 64 million impact asphalt volumes decreased 4 from the prior year volume growth in california our largest asphalt market was more than offset by lower volumes in arizona our second largest market efforts to mitigate the earnings impact of energy inflation will continue with positive results expected to contribute to unit profitability improvement in 2022 





3 concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 

 increased 90 in 2021 1 

 decreased 5 in 2020 

 decreased 4 in 2019 



concrete segment gross profit increased 101 million to 543 million earnings contributions from the us concrete operations more than offset the earnings impact from lower volumes in our legacy virginia operations the lower volumes were due mostly to the timing of several large projects that were completed in the prior year material margins increased in our legacy operations despite lower volumes 



4 calcium 

calcium segment gross profit decreased 07 million from 2020 to 22 million 



in total the 2021 gross profit contribution from our three nonaggregates asphalt concrete and calcium segments was 777 million a 446 million or 36 decrease from 2020 



selling administrative and general sag expenses 

in millions 

as a percentage of total revenues sag expense was 

 75 in 2021 — increased 010 percentage points 10 basis points 

 74 in 2020 — decreased 010 percentage points 10 basis points 

 75 in 2019 — decreased 010 percentage points 10 basis points 

our comparative total company employment levels at year end 

 increased 26 in 2021 

 decreased 2 in 2020 

 increased 6 in 2019 

the 2021 increase in our employment level was primarily the result of our august 2021 acquisition of us concrete s ee note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” as noted above 2021 sag expenses were 4176 million or 75 as a percentage of total revenues up from 74 in 2020 the current year includes overhead expenses associated with the us concrete business that were not in the prior year additionally increased routine business development activities and more normalized travel expenses due in part to integration activities contributed to the increase we remain focused on further leveraging our overhead cost structure 

gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses 

in millions 

the 2021 gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses of  1201 million includes a net pretax gain of 1147 from the sale of southern california real estate previously mined land that we reclaimed for commercial and retail development we remain focused on our efforts to maximize the value of our portfolio of quarry operations as they move through their lifecycle of land management the 2020 gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses of  40 million includes a net immaterial pretax loss from readymixed concrete divestitures s ee note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



other operating expense net 

other operating expense which has an approximate runrate of 120 million a year exclusive of discrete items is composed primarily of idle facilities expense environmental remediation costs property abandonments and gain loss on settlement of aros total other operating expense and significant discrete items included in the total were

interest expense 

in millions 

interest expense was 1493 million in 2021 compared to 1360 million in 2020 this increase resulted primarily from an additional 94 million of interest expense related to financing the acquisition of us concrete see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional discussion 



income taxes 

our income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 



the 443 million increase in our 2021 income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in earnings from continuing operations and the increase of our alabama net operating loss nol valuation allowance the 206 million increase in our 2020 income tax expense was primarily related to a decrease in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and a smaller research  development tax credit 

in february 2021 the alabama business competitiveness act was signed into law this act contained a provision requiring most taxpayers to change from a threefactor doubleweighted sales method to a singlesales factor method to apportion income to alabama this provision had the effect of significantly reducing our apportionment of income to alabama thereby further inhibiting our ability to utilize our alabama nol carryforward as a result in the first quarter of 2021 we increased the valuation allowance by 137 million no other material tax impacts resulted from the enactment of this act 

see note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

discontinued operations 

pretax loss from discontinued operations were 

 45 million in 2021 

 47 million in 2020 

 65 million in 2019 

pretax loss from discontinued operations for 2021 2020 and 2019 resulted primarily from general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business for additional information about discontinued operations  see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption discontinued operations 

known trends or uncertainties 

as described above in the executive summary inflationary pressures and labor constraints were trends impacting our operations in 2021 although inflationary pressures can create short to mediumterm headwinds the combination of inflation and improving visibility of demand has created and may continue to create a favorable environment for price increases additionally labor constraints especially truck drivers have caused delays and inefficiencies in our operations as well as those of our customers if labor constraints continue and demand remains strong our operations may proceed at a slower pace which may effectively extend the recovery while allowing us the opportunity to compound price control costs and grow earnings further recently the mexican government has taken actions that adversely affect our operations in that country including delays in issuing a historically routine threeyear customs permit for our deepwater port mexico instead issued a shortterm customs permit that must be renewed after two months while we continue to negotiate with the mexican authorities to reach a mutually agreeable and beneficial solution failure by the mexican government to issue future customs permits or its taking of any other measures that force us to cease our operations in mexico would have an adverse effect on our ability to supply customers 



reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

samestore 

we have provided certain information on a samestore basis when discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods we may exclude the operating results of recently acquireddivested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed these recently acquireddivested businesses are disclosed in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis we believe that measuring performance on a samestore basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity our samestore information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by gaap we present this measure as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight  delivery which are passthrough activities it also excludes other revenues related to services such as landfill tipping fees that are derived from our aggregates business additionally we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial committed bank line of credit additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets the sale of surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2022 including 

 contractual obligations 

 debt service obligations 

 capital expenditures 

 potential acquisitions 

 dividend payments 

 potential share repurchases 

during 2022 we expect to spend between 600 million and 650 million on capital expenditures including growth and capacityadding projects excluding future cash requirements for capital expenditures our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 2021 are summarized in the table below 





as of december 31 2021 we were contingently liable for 8602 million within 558 surety bonds underwritten by various surety companies these bonds guarantee our performance and are required primarily by states and municipalities and their related agencies the top five in amount totaled 2060 million 24 and were for certain construction contracts and 



reclamation obligations we have agreed to indemnify the underwriting companies against any exposure under the surety bonds no material claims have been made against our surety bonds 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities 

our balanced approach to capital deployment remains unchanged we intend to balance reinvestment in our business growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders while sustaining financial strength and flexibility 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to balance the cost of capital and the risk of financial stress we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 

 maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity 

 proactively manage our debt maturity schedule such that repaymentrefinancing risk in any single year is low 

 maintain an appropriate balance of fixedrate and floatingrate debt 

 minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility 

as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity sources and needs and take appropriate actions 

cash 

included in our december 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of 2415 million is 65 million of restricted cash see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption restricted cash  

cash from operating activities 

in millions 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 





2021 versus 2020 — net cash provided by operating activities was 10119 million during 2021 a 585 million decrease compared to 2020 this decrease primarily resulted from a net increase in working capital compared to the prior year period 



days sales outstanding a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables were 476 days at december 31 2021 compared to 449 days at december 31 2020 additionally our over 90 day balance of 460 million at december 31 2021 was up significantly from 155 million at december 31 2020 excluding customer receivables from the recent us concrete acquisition both days sales outstanding 444 days and over 90 day balances 85 million were favorable compared to the prior year all customer accounts are actively managed and no losses in excess of amounts reserved are currently expected

at december 31 2021 total debt to 2021 adjusted ebitda was 27 times or 25 times on a net debt basis reflecting 2415 million of cash on hand our weightedaverage debt maturity was 113 years and the effective weightedaverage interest rate was 368 

bridge facility delayed draw term loan and l ine of credit 

in june 2021 concurrent with the announcement of the pending acquisition of us concrete see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional information we obtained a 22000 million bridge facility commitment from truist bank later in june 2021 we entered into a 16000 million delayed draw term loan with a subset of the banks that provide our line of credit and terminated the bridge facility commitment the delayed draw term loan was drawn in august 2021 for 16000 million in connection with the acquisition of us concrete and was paid down to 11000 million in september 2021 amounts repaid are no longer available for borrowing and any outstanding borrowings are due august 2024 the delayed draw term loan contains covenants customary for an unsecured investmentgrade facility and mirror those in our line of credit as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the delayed draw term loan covenants borrowings cost ranges and other details are described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” financing costs for the bridge facility commitment and the delayed draw term loan facility totaled 133 million 94 million of which was recognized as interest expense in 2021 

in september 2020 we executed a new fiveyear unsecured line of credit of 10000 million incurring 46 million of deferred transaction costs covenants borrowings cost ranges and other details are described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants the credit margin for libor borrowings was 1125 the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 0125 and the commitment fee for the unused portion was 0100 

as of december 31 2021 our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was 9404 million utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows 

 none was borrowed 

 596 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit 



term debt 

essentially all of our 39496 million face value of term debt which includes the 11000 million delayed draw term loan is unsecured 28402 million of such debt is governed by two essentially identical indentures that contain customary investmentgrade type covenants as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all term debt covenants 

in august 2021 we assumed 4345 million fair value of senior notes due 2029 in connection with the acquisition of us concrete and retired these notes in september 2021 

in may 2020 we issued 7500 million of 350 senior notes due 2030 total proceeds were 7414 million net of discounts and transaction costs 2500 million of the proceeds were used to retire the 2500 million floating rate notes due june 2020 the remainder of the proceeds together with cash on hand was used to retire the 5000 million floating rate notes due in march 2021

debt ratings 

our debt ratings and outlooks as of december 31 2021 are as follows 



l ibor transition 

the london interbank offered rate libor historically quoted in five currencies including us dollar and seven tenors from overnight to 12 months is used extensively globally as a reference rate for financial contracts eg corporate bonds and loans and commercial contracts eg real estate leases in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced its intention to cease publishing libor at year end 2021 in march 2021 fca and ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of libor announced that publication of libor would cease at year end 2021 except for us dollar libor in five tenors that will be published through june 2023 



the expected discontinuation of libor led to the formation of working groups in the us and elsewhere to recommend alternative reference rates the us working group is the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the arrc has selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred alternative to libor and helped establish standard language for credit agreements to address the pending change from libor to sofr transition language the transition language includes credit spread adjustment language intended to based on the historical relationship of 1 month libor and sofr make the transition indifferent to both lenders and borrowers 

as of december 31 2021 we had two material debt instruments with libor as a reference rate 1 our 10000 million line of credit 00 million outstanding and 2 our delayed draw term loan facility 11000 million outstanding these two instruments contain the transition language and we expect our borrowing costs to change immaterially when these two instruments move from libor to sofr

the detail of our common stock purchases all of which were open market purchases are as follows 



there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

standby letters of credit 

for a discussion of our standby letters of credit see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the followin g c ritical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 goodwill impairment 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

5 environmental compliance costs 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

1 goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2021 goodwill represents 27 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 19 reporting units of which 11 carry goodwill based primarily on geographic location we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill i f the fair value exceeds its carrying value the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired however if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 



our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and if applicable acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 2019 through 2021 ind icated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded in excess of 100 their carrying values allocation of the purchase price for the us concrete acquisition see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” has not been finalized and therefore these operations were excluded from our goodwill impairment tests 

for additional information about goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2021 net property plant  equipment represents 41 of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 13 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg asphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates impacts the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded no material losses on impairment of longlived assets 



we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being used in our operations these assets totaled 5162 million at december 31 2021 representing an 11 increase from december 31 2020 of the total 5162 million approximately 40 relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations in addition approximately 15 is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 45 is composed of aggregates asphalt and concrete operating assets idled temporarily we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information about longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

our strategic longterm plan s include potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesse s w hen an acquisition is completed our consolidated statement s of comprehensive income includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date that control is obtained 

how we determine and allocate the purchase price 

the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assume d as of the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the ne t f air value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions additionally the amounts assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill which is not amortized can significantly affect our results of operations 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactio n a nd therefore represents an exit price a fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below 

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ‎ level 2 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data ‎ level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publiclytraded entities and assumed obligations for publiclytraded longterm debt 

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquire d m achinery and equipment land buildings and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligation s a dditionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place and other identifiable intangible assets we determine the fair values of owned mineral reserves and leased mineral interests using a lost profits approach and or an excess earnings approach these valuation techniques require management to estimate future cash flows the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price shipment volumes production costs and capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows 



other identifiable intangible assets may include but are not limited t o n oncompetition agreements  t he fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or a market approach 

measurement period adjustments 

we may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill if any recognized in the transaction the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined the measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits requires that we use assumptions for the valuation of projected benefit obligations pbo and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions for discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations and the expected return on plan assets due to plan changes made in 2013 annual pay increases do not materially impact plan obligations 

 discount rates — we use a highquality bond full yield curve approach specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow to establish the discount rates at each measurement date 

 expected return on plan assets — our expected return on plan assets is 1 a longterm view based on our current asset allocation and 2 a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary 

 rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits — we project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits 

see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for the discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits  

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the pbo and the annual net benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 



as of the december 31 2021 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets decreased from 9443 million for the prior yearend to 8605 million due primarily to the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company annuity liftout partially offset by favorable market performance our postretirement plans are unfunded 

the discount rate is the weightedaverage of the spot rates for each cash flow on the yield curve for highquality bonds as of the measurement date as of the december 31 2021 measurement date the pbo of our pension plans decreased from 10595 million to 9155 million this decrease was primarily due to an increase in discount rates for the plans approximately 03 to 06 percentage points and the annuity liftout the pbo of our postretirement plans increased from 339 million to 460 million this increase was primarily due to a change in plan design effective october 1 2021 the retiree medical plans were updated for nongrandfathered participants to provide a subsidy equal to 70 of the gold ppo premium 



during 2022 we expect to recognize net pension expense of 19 million and net postretirement expense of 13 million compared to expense of 31 million which includes a 121 million settlement charge and income of 12 million respectively in 2021 excluding the settlement charge the expected increase in pension expense is primarily due to a reduction in the longterm return on asset assumption from 525 to 400 the increase in postretirement expense is primarily due to increased benefits for nongrandfathered participants as described above 

we do not anticipate that contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2022 and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

5 environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs we 

 expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy 

 expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues 

 accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost 

at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount if no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2021 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 31 million — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information about environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 100 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and we establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information about claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we file federal state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items we are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

we recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation 

generally we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years before 2018 while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate 

we consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination or the expiration of the statute of limitations upon resolution of a tax position any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business to manage these market risks we may use derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and risk of financial stress such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings we at times use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixedrate and floatingrate debt 

at december 31 2021 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was 44237 million compared to a face value of 39496 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately 3809 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d  15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2021 

excluding the us concrete acquisition noted below no material changes were made during the fourth quarter of 2021 to our internal controls over financial reporting nor have there been other factors that materially affect these controls 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f

we completed our acquisition of us concrete on august 26 2021 and have not yet included us concrete in management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting we are currently integrating us concrete into our operations and internal control processes accordingly pursuant to the sec’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment for one year following the acquisition the scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include us concrete us concrete constituted approximately 10 of our total assets as of december 31 2021 and approximately 8 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 deloitte  touche llps report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

limitations of effectiveness of controls and procedures 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

 item 1 

business 

vulcan materials compan y operates primarily in the us and is t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and a supplier of construction paving services  we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy delivered by trucks ships barges and trains our products are the indispensable materials building homes offices places of worship schools hospitals and factories as well as vital infrastructure including highways bridges roads ports and harbors water systems campuses dams airports and rail networks as of december 31 2020 we had 380 active aggregates facilities 70 asphalt facilities and 46 concrete facilities 

business strategy 

our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our strategy for longterm value creation is built on   1 an aggregates  focus ed business   2 a disciplined approach to growth management and capital allocation   3 a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability  4 a holistic approach to land management  and  5 our commitment to safety health and the environment  

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist and significant barriers to entry exist in most markets vulcan is uniquely positioned as the largest aggregates supplier in the us and the most aggregatesfocused public company 

source 2019 reported financial information and company estimates 

given o ur focus on aggregates  we 

n take advantage of size and scale  while certain aspects of each aggregates operation are unique such as its location within a local market and its particular geological characteristics every operation uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service our 380 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2020 provide opportunities to share and scale best practices across our operations and to procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement technical support and engineering 



 build and hold substantial reserves  our reserves are critical to our longterm success we currently have 159 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations these restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 

2 growth management and capital allocation 

growth management  d emand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment as such w e have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and to divest assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy during the period 20 20  20 30  moodys analytics projects that 73  of the us population growth 70  of household formation and 61  of new jobs will occur in vulcanserved state s o ur coasttocoast footprint serves 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth metropolitan statistical areas in 20 states plus the district of columbi a th e close proximity of our a ggregates reserve s and our p roduction facilitie s to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in highreturn projects 

source moody’s analytics as of december 10 2020 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 88 of our 2020 revenues while our top five accounted for 61 





since becoming a public company in 1956 vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions for example in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc expanding our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other midatlantic and southeastern states in 2017 we acquired aggregates usa greatly expanding our ability to serve customers in florida georgia and south carolina additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton aggregates acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth for example during 2019 we acquired aggregates operations that strengthened our position in tennessee 

while an aggregatesfocused business we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability o ur downstream businesses asphalt and concrete use vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusivel y in 2017 we entered the asphalt market in tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in 2018 we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton downstream acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth for example during 2020 we acquired asphalt operations in texas expanding our already strong presence in that market from 2018 to 2020 we invested over 300 million in acquisitions as outlined in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

capital allocation  our longterm capital allocation strategy is focused on the following priorities 

 operating capital maintain and grow the value of our franchise 

 growth capital including greenfields and acquisitions 

 dividend growth with a keen focus on sustainability 

 return excess cash to shareholders primarily via share repurchases 

our strategic priorities have given us the ability to leverage decisions we have made over the past few years during 2020 we reinvested 3608 million into core operating  maintenance capital and internal growth capital in addition to 3841 million and 4691 million reinvested in 2019 and 2018 respectively these investments are fundamental actions that sustain and strengthen the business they improve the longerterm efficiency capacity and flexibility of our production and they support our strong commitment to superior customer service 

as illustrated below our annual return on invested capital roic increased 04 percentage points 40 basis points in 2020 as a 4 increase in adjusted ebitda net earnings decreased 5 in 2020 was leveraged with disciplined capital management average invested capital only increased 1 





3 compounding improvement in profitability 

our focus on the following four strategic disciplines has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

 operational excellence — continuous and sustainable improvements in both our operating disciplines and our industryleading safety performance coupled with better asset utilization through improved availability and throughput leads to effective cost control 

 strategic sourcing — leveraging common practices and innovation leads to more time in our plants and with our suppliers to deliver the right parts and services at the right time and optimize the total cost of ownership 

 commercial excellence — clearly defined roles and responsibilities together with access to real time forwardlooking metrics leads to our sales teams spending less time on nonselling activities and more time responding to our customers’ needs 

 logistics innovation – partnering with our customers truck drivers and contractors to provide a bundled logistics solution with digital shipping records and onsite mobile visibility leads to streamlined scheduling speed and accuracy of delivery and efficient backoffice processes 

we manage these disciplines locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively 

4  la nd management 

with approximately 240000 acres in our land portfolio a longterm holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success from premining to mining to reclamation we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land creating maximum value for the business our shareholders and our communities 

we are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development after mining our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs aquifer recharge basins public parks habitat mitigation banks wetlands productive farmland and residential and commercial developments 

because of the evolving needs of our communities we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete our work with state regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations 

5  safety health and the environment 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate we are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives and our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate 



product lines 

our products are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals schools shopping centers factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives our communities and the economy we have four operating and reportable segments aggregates asphalt concrete and calcium organized around our principal product lines 

our 2020 total revenues and gross profit by segment are illustrated as follows calcium revenues and gross profit were less than one percent 



for actual amounts see note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we generally ship our products upon receipt of a purchase order or in some cases simply a price quote therefore we do not have a significant order backlog 

1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 

 as a base material underneath highways walkways airport runways parking lots and railroads 

 to aid in water filtration purification and erosion control 

 as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including 

 houses and apartments 

 roads bridges and parking lots 

 schools and hospitals 

 commercial buildings and retail space 

 sewer systems 

 power plants 

 airports and runways 



aggregates industry 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business include 

 location and transportation of reserves aggregates have a high weighttovalue ratio and in most cases must be produced near where they are used if not transportation can cost more than the materials rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials where practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive approximately 80 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck 

exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available highquality aggregates we serve these markets from quarries that have access to costeffective longhaul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on mexico’s yucatan peninsula with our fleet of panamaxclass selfunloading ships a pproximately 17 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered by truck to the customer after reaching a sales yard by rail or water the remaining 3 of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 

 limited product substitution there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lowercost alternative to virgin aggregates however many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet technical specifications and performancebased criteria for durability strength and other qualities likewise the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications 

 highly fragmented industry the us aggregates industry is composed of over 5000 companies that manage close to 11000 operations this fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities 

through strategic acquisitions and investments we have developed an unmatched coasttocoast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers we have over 23000 customers in 20 states the district of columbia and mexico 

 flexible production capabilities the production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and through a series of screens separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used production capacity is flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale when additional growth materializes 

 raw material inputs largely controlled unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves stone sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources however production does require the use of explosives hydrocarbon fuels and electric power 

 demand cycles longterm growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population jobs and households while shortterm and mediumterm demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries 

the drivers underpinning longterm demand and sustained pricing growth remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy they include population growth gains in total employment shortterm disruption due to covid19 pandemic and in household income and wages a continuing increase in household formations the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand a multiyear federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels stable state tax receipts public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the longterm trendline and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure 



aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatelyfunded construction and it generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publiclyfunded projects particularly highways roads and bridges which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

‎ source company estimates 



public sector construction market 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges buildings airports schools prisons sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2020 publiclyfunded construction accounted for approximately 43 of our total aggregates shipments and approximately 23 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 

 public sector funding generally public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multiyear laws which provide certainty in funding amounts program structures rules and regulations federal spending is governed by authorization budget and appropriations laws the level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies 

 state and local transportation funding since 2012 32 states have increased or adjusted taxes on motor fuel to increase revenues available for transportation investment most recently in 2020 the virginia legislature raised its statewide gas tax and voters in arkansas renewed a ½ cent sales tax measure originally approved in 2012 to provide significant revenue for highway construction and maintenance through motor fuel tax increases other states have increased revenues outside of fuel taxes or made onetime increases since 2012 eleven vulcanserved states representing over 87 of our 2020 total revenues have averaged a 69 increase in their states’ revenues for highways 

in addition we benefit from state and local transportation funding ballot measures major transportation funding measures in vulcanserved areas approved in 2020 are estimated to result in 2575 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads streets and bridges across the united states voters in 18 states approved 94 of 322 measures in 2020 which will generate 141 billion in new and recurring transportation investment this represents a record high approval rate and continues a trend in which voters have approved 83 of nearly 2300 transportation investment ballot measures since 2010 

 federal highway funding  in december 2015 president obama signed a new longterm federal highway and transit authorization bill fixing america’s surface transportation infrastructure act fast act into law after the final legislation received strong bipartisan support in both the house and the senate the fast act provides multiyear funding to state and local governments in support of road bridge intermodal and public transportation projects president trump signed a oneyear extension of the fast act into law in 2020 

the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2021 the bipartisan budget act of 2018 added approximately 2 billion per year to base highway programs in 2018 and 2019 in addition for ffy 2021 state departments of transportation were allocated 10 billion in emergency aid from the 900 billion coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act a covid19 relief measure passed by congress in december 2020 as part of a final yearend legislative package 

the longterm nature of the fast act is important the federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 the fast act also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects — particularly freight projects in states where we operate we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with fast act funding and policy implementation 

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending with the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program authorized at 275 million in line with the previous program outlays and growing to 300 million by 2020 the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects 



the fast act extension expires on september 30 2021 congress is in the process of developing policy and funding legislative proposals for fast act reauthorization it would not be atypical for additional extensions of current law to be required to provide congress with adequate time to complete the reauthorization process historically there is minimal disruption to the flow of federal funding to state and local projects due to extensions 

 federal water infrastructure in december 2020 president trump signed the water resources development act of 2020 wrda 2020 into law enacting the fourth consecutive biennial authorization for the us army corps of engineers army corps since 2014 wrda 2020 reauthorizes needed investment in america’s ports channels locks dams and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities it also improves the united states environmental protection agency’s epa programs for storm water water recycling and sewer overflow projects the ffy 2021 appropriations for the corps also passed as part of the yearend legislative package funds for the first time the army corps water infrastructure financing program cwifp which was authorized in the water resources reform and development act of 2014 wrrda 2014 modeled after the highly popular tifia program in the surface transportation sector cwifp will accelerate nonfederal investments in water resources infrastructure by providing longterm lowcost loans to creditworthy borrowers 

p rivate sector construction market 

the private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction in 2020 privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 57 of our total aggregates shipments 

 nonresidential construction private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends the growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals places of worship and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firms ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing this end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 

 residential construction household formations in vulcanserved states continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the united states the majority of residential construction is for singlefamily housing with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor 

us housing starts as measured by dodge data  analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2020 total annual housing starts in the us reached 1475 million units 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad tracks we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate attractive financial returns and enhance financial returns in our core aggregates segment  we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete within each of our three geographic markets as noted below aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 



2 asphalt 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in alabama arizona california new mexico tennessee and texas in october 2020 we strengthened our asphalt position in texas by acquiring additional asphalt operations in june 2018 we acquired additional asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in texas in march 2018 we entered the alabama asphalt market through the acquisition of an aggregates asphalt mix and construction paving business for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segme nt relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement which we purchase from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities 

3 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california maryland texas virginia and washington dc in april 2020 we exited the new mexico readymixed concrete market we retained the concrete plants and mobile fleet which is leased to the buyer and obtained a 20year aggregates supply agreement in october 2019 we expanded our readymixed concrete operations in virginia via an acquisition in march 2018 we exited the georgia readymixed concrete market we retained all real property which is leased to the buyer and obtained a longterm aggregates supply agreement for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility readymixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third party producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck 

4 calcium 

our calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t industries with high  quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 



other businessrelated items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 

competitors 

we operate in a fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers accounted for 31 of the total us aggregates production in 2020 despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 

 cemex sab de cv 

 crh plc 

 heidelbergcement ag 

 lafargeholcim 

 martin marietta materials inc 

 mdu resources group inc 

 summit materials inc 

because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5000 companies managing close to 11000 operations during 2020  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 2020 our five largest customers accounted for 75 of our total revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 18 of our total revenues although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publiclyfunded construction such as highways airports and government buildings a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publiclyfunded construction the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local state or federal governments in addition our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coasttocoast ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers 



environmental costs and governmental regulation 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local laws and regulations in the communities where we conduct business compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the time and effort of our employees as well as financial resources the following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business for additional information about our risks related to government regulations see item 1a “risk factors” 

our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety including regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration msha and occupational safety and health administration osha compliance with these various regulations requires capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2021 and 2022 will be 113 million and 75 million respectively these anticipated expenditures are not material to our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share in that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded at fair value in our financial statements at the time the obligation arises to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about environmental matters and reclamation obligations see notes 12 and 17 respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

human capital 

as of january 1 2021 we employed 8431 people in the united states of these employees 651 are represented by labor unions also as of that date we employed 415 people in mexico and 1 person in the bahamas and of these employees 339 are represented by labor unions we do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2021 

vulcan’s commitment to our people has played a key role in the ongoing success and growth of our company throughout our long history we are dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect integrity teamwork and trust among our workforce our people share a competitive drive to be the best they can be and do the right thing which benefits all our stakeholders 

diversity and inclusion are important values at vulcan  our continued investment in people and strong commitment to diversity and inclusion will help us attract grow and retain the best talent possible in 2015 we escalated and formalized our efforts in this area with the launch of our diversity and inclusion council to promote an open workplace where everyone regardless of background race or other factors is free to contribute and grow in 2019 we signed the ceo action for diversity  inclusion tm pledge and we forged a longterm partnership with historically black colleges and universities hbcus to support our future leaders in our communities and on our team 

as a result of our commitment to diversity and inclusion we have 

 cultivated a diverse talent pipeline of next generation leaders through our operationssales trainee program 

 expanded the diversity of our workforce at middle management and higher levels 

 increased the number of female hires and promotions in senior leadership roles 

 developed a fiveyear strategy through our diversity and inclusion council 

 built partnerships with hbcus to recruit talented minority students for internships and management training roles 



today approximately 38 of our workforce is diverse and we have a number of initiatives to continue building a diverse and inclusive workforce we have more than doubled the number of diverse division and corporate officers since 2013 our board of directors is 36 diverse and we earned recognition in 2017 by 2020 women on boards for having 20 or more of our board seats held by women 

we believe that learning is fundamental to every job and we encourage our people to expand and explore their capabilities for continued growth our industryleading training and development programs encourage collaboration and enable people to innovate and flourish on the job and in the community these programs 

 provide our employees with a tuition reimbursement program which pays up to 100 of tuition costs based on academic performance 

 encourage personal and professional growth through our mentoring program which has graduated more than 1906 employees 

 prepare future seniorlevel leaders through our leadership 2022 series in partnership with the university of north carolina chapel hill 

 offer mini mba programs and other continuing education opportunities 

the result is strong employee engagement that puts vulcan in the top 10 in our most recent mckinsey  company’s organizational health index cycle 2017 which benchmarked vulcan against over 5 million respondents from 1700 companies

 item 1a 

risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

economicpolitical risks 

our business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles — our products are principally sold to the us construction industry since our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets our profits are sensitive to the underlying national regional and local economic conditions construction spending which is cyclical is affected by general economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic shifts industry cycles employment levels inflation and other business economic and financial factors that are beyond our control a downturn in construction activities or spending in vulcanserved markets particularly in our top revenuegenerating markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a pandemic epidemic or other public health emergency such as the recent outbreak of the current coronavirus covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows — our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics epidemics or other public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic and the president of the united states declared the covid19 outbreak a national emergency the outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing or reimplementing strict measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments school closures and other measures in addition governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and may take further action as circumstances warrant  

consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date we currently continue to operate across our footprint as an essential business notwithstanding our continued operations and an economic environment that has shown signs of improvement the covid19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations supply chain transportation networks and customers which may lower our revenues and ebitda including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking the covid19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and services the progression of this matter has and may continue to negatively impact our business or results of operations by affecting the health of our employees and through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers the extent to which the covid19 outbreak impacts our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and geographic spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including the reimplementation of restrictions on economic activity following new outbreaks the longterm impacts of the virus on transportation revenues government budgets and other funding priorities and the extent and pace at which normal economic and operating conditions can resume there can be no assurance that we will not be impacted by adverse consequences that may be brought about by pandemics on global financial markets which may reduce resources share prices and financial liquidity and may severely limit the availability of financing capital 



changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environment al an d other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment create restrictions on our products or impede our access to reserves or opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure — our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments in 2020 voters in local jurisdictions in arizona california florida georgia north carolina south carolina texas and virginia among others approved bond and revenueraising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects in 2020 virginia p assed new longterm highway funding legislation and voters in arkansas made permanent a ½ cent gas tax increase first approved in 2012  the federal fast act a five year fullyfunded road bridge and public transportation authorization law was extended for a year and continues to provide assistance to state dots and metro areas while congress contemplates new longterm highway and transit legislation in 2021 however given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities availability of water and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity a number of our facilities are located in desert climates and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of energy or water in the past we cannot guarantee that we will not in the future furthermore public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa we face political and other risks associated with our international operations including our largest production facility located in playa del carmen mexico these risks may include changes in international trade policies such as the united states  mexico  canada agreement usmca imposition of duties taxes or government royalties arbitrary changes to permits zoning classifications or operating agreements or overt acts by foreign governments including expropriations and other forms of takings of property in addition failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrated therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 



the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas  if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations  if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs  therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments 

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 2020 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact the cost andor availability of financing — we currently have 336 billion of debt with maturities between 2021 and 2048 given our current credit metrics and ratings together with other factors we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due furthermore we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investmentgrade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit ratings could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 



we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items  changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 goodwill impairment 

 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

 pension and other postretirement benefits 

 environmental compliance costs 

 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 income taxes 

these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the phaseout of libor or the replacement of libor with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate libor may adversely affect interest rates — libor is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of financial transactions in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is unclear whether libor will cease to exist at that time and if so what reference rate will replace it or if new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arrc has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the alternative to us libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of sofr as the primary alternative to libor we have two material debt instruments with libor as a reference rate 1 5000 million floatingrate notes due march 2021 and 2 10000 million line of credit none outstanding at december 31 2020 due september 2025 at this time we cannot predict the impact of a departure from libor as a reference rate 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations — labor unions represent approximately 11 of our workforce disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs andor reduced revenues 



general risk factors 

a significant interruption of our information technology systems or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results — given our reliance on information technology our own and that of our service providers’ such as amazon web services a significant interruption in the availability of information technology or the loss of confidential personal or proprietary information whether our own our employees’ our suppliers’ or our customers’ regardless of the cause could negatively impact our operations and financial results we have a dedicated information security team that executes and updates as warranted based on emerging risk and new risk management technology our information security program the audit committee which has oversight responsibility for our information security program is briefed on such program at least twice annually and our chief financial officer is briefed on such program at least quarterly while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology and routinely test the security of our information systems network we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 

o ur products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers  significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs  truckrailcarbarge shortages truck driver and rail crew shortages capacity constraint s and minimum tonnage requirements additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation  which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resource s a nd our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability  variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

aggregates resources and reserves calculations are estimates only and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the inherent variability of the deposit and recoverability of saleable material in the mining process — the calculation of mineral resources and reserves are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis which may prove to be unpredictable until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed the quantity must be considered as an estimate only 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of a chemical s b usines s  although we divested the chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — w e operate construction paving businesses in alabama tennessee and texas in some instances including many of our fixed price paving contracts we agree to complete a project by a certain date if we fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay consequently the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites that we own or owned where we operate or have operated or where we sent materials for recycling or disposal as well as related offsite investigations and cleanups as required by gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier of construction aggregates we serve markets in twenty states washington dc and the local market surrounding our operation in mexico our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

our current estimate of 159 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects a de creas e o f 03 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  



reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained through permit contract or grandfathered status  leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 159 billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2020 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2020 and the types of facilities operated 





of the 159 billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 2020 92 billion tons or 58  are located on owned land and 67 billion tons or 42  are located on leased land 



the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities contributed more than 5 to our total revenues in 2020 



asphalt concrete and calcium 

as of december 31 2020 we o perate d a number of facilities producing asphalt mix readymixed concrete and calcium in several of our divisions as reflected in the table below  





the asphalt and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials 



our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  the brooksville quarry is not individually material to our business calcium resources and reserves are outlined in the tabl e below 



our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products such as animal feed and plastics high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse products the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 980 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space consists of approximately 184410 square feet and is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is approximately  37 million

our bestinclass aggregates business along with the efforts and dedication of our employees allowed us to overcome covid19 related disruptions in 2020 as we saw in 2020 demand for our products can be subject to market fluctuations outside of our control we remain focused on the factors within our control including our pricing and cost actions both of which contributed to further improvement in our industryleading unit margins in 2020 most impressive we delivered yearoveryear gains in aggregates unit profitability throughout each quarter in 2020 our ability to leverage our four strategic disciplines — commercial and operational excellence logistics innovation and strategic sourcing — enabled us to expand unit margins deliver improved cash flows and increase returns on invested capital our team’s hard work along with our leading market positions and strong financial foundation will enable us to capitalize on an improving demand outlook in 2021 

our operating plans are underpinned by our aforementioned four strategic disciplines a healthy balance sheet strong liquidity and the engagement of our people 2020 revenues were 48568 million 1 lower than the prior year while gross profit margins expanded across each segment effective cost management throughout the organization and aggregates price growth helped drive margin expansion net earnings were 5845 million and adjusted ebitda was a record 13235 million 

at year end total debt to 2020 adjusted ebitda was 25 times or 16 times on a net debt basis reflecting 11980 million of cash on hand — approximately 5000 million will be used to pay off certain debt maturities due in march 2021 our weightedaverage debt maturity was 13 years and the effective weightedaverage interest rate was 41 

return on invested capital increased 04 percentage points 40 basis points from the prior year to 143 operating cash flows were 10704 million up 9 versus the previous year solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management led to these results 

capital allocation 

our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged through economic cycles we intend to balance reinvestment in our business growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility evidenced by our strong balance sheet and investmentgrade credit ratings our capital allocation priorities are  as follows 

1 operating capital maintain and grow the value of our franchise 

2 growth capital including greenfields and acquisitions 

3 dividend growth with a keen focus on sustainability 

4 return excess cash to shareholders primarily via share repurchases 

our first priority is to maintain and protect our valuable franchise by keeping our operations in good working order to ensure the production of high quality materials and timely delivery of goods and services to our customers this capital r equiremen t expand s and contract s as production and shipment levels c hang e  during 2020 we invested  2393 millio n t o replace or improve existing property plant  equipment 

our second priority is to gro w o ur franchis e t hrough internal growth projects and business acquisitions  internal growth projects have generally been among our highest returning project s  during 2020  we invested  1229 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves develop new production andor distribution sites enhance our distribution capabilities and support the targeted growth of our asphalt and concrete operations during the fourth quarter of 2020 we restarted planned growth projects that were put on hold in march 2020 as a result of the pandemic for business acquisitions we tend to look fo r b olton acquisitions which are easy to integrate and will pursue large business combinations that are the right fit and the right price we use strategic and returnsbased criteria to price potential acquisitions and are disciplined in our approach we look at a lot of potential acquisitions and only make offers on a few we closed two business acquisitions during 2020 for total consideration of 734 million 

our third priority is growing the dividend with a keen focus on sustainability through the economic cycle during 2020 we paid a dividend per share of 136 and paid total dividends of 1802 million 



and finally if there is excess cash after fulfilling the prior capital allocation priorities we will consider returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases during 2020 we returned 261 million to our shareholders through share repurchases 

for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

market developments and outlook 

construction employment gains in key markets are a positive signal that activity levels are recovering across our footprint as compelling fundamentals in residential construction support growing demand in 2021 shipments into private nonresidential continue to benefit from growth in heavy industrial projects such as data centers and warehouses while construction starts in other categories remain below the prior year recent improvements in highway lettings and contract awards indicate growing confidence and visibility fueling advancement of planned projects particularly in the second half of 2021 

the pricing environment remains positive and we continue to execute at a high level — positioning us well for 2021 we are encouraged by the continued strength in residential construction activity particularly singlefamily housing our expectation is also supported by the recent improvement in highway awards and construction employment trends in key markets data centers distribution centers and warehouses which now comprise the largest share of new private nonresidential project awards will continue to underpin demand in this end market we believe these leading indicators along with sustaining a positive pricing environment can be a catalyst for further recovery in construction activity during 2021 

management expectations for 2021 include 

 aggregates shipments down 2 to up 2 versus 2020 

 aggregates freightadjusted price increase of 2 to 4 from 2020 

 collective asphalt concrete and calcium segment gross profit up midto high single digits 

 sag expenses of 365 million to 375 million 

 interest expense of approximately 130 million 

 depreciation depletion accretion and amortization expense of approximately 400 million 

 an effective tax rate of approximately 21 

 earnings from continuing operations of 480 to 540 per diluted share 

 net earnings of 640 million to 720 million 

 adjusted ebitda of 1340 billion to 1440 billion 

 no major changes in covid shelterinplace restrictions 

additionally we expect to spend between 450 million and 475 million on capital expenditures including growth projects we will continue to review our plans and will adjust as needed while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity 

for support functions we previously implemented remote work arrangements and restricted business travel effective midmarch 2020 to date these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to maintain our business operations including the operation of financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 



competitive advantages 

aggregates footprint 

over time we have strategically and systematically built one of the most valuable aggregates franchises in the us with a footprint that is impossible to replicate zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries such regulations while curtailing expansion also increase the value of our reserves that were zoned and permitted decades ago 

demand for aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have a coasttocoast footprint that serves 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth metropolitan statistical areas msas and states where 73  of us population growth from 2020 to 2030 is projected to occur as state and federal spending increases vulcan is poised to benefit greatly from growing private and public demand for aggregates thereby delivering significant longterm value for our shareholders

based on people added from 2020 to 2030 



compounding improvement in profitability 

we have continued to deliver strong financial performance over time and through business cycles through our aggregatesled strategy and focus on our four strategic disciplines — operational excellence strategic sourcing commercial excellence and logistics innovation as outlined in item 1 “business” under the “business strategy” heading — we have created one of the most profitable public companies in our industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale as markets recover from the covid19 pandemic 

safety health and environmental performance 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate over our more than six decades as a public company we have built a strong resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way 

we are a leader in our industry in safety health and environmental performance with a safety record substantially better than the industry average we apply the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another the result is a record of safety excellence consistently outperforming the industry 

source mine safety and health administration msha records and internal vulcan data 



we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives resulting in 986 citationfree inspections out of all 2020 federal and state environmental inspections 



we lead community relations programs that serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate during 2020 we operated 37 certified wildlife habitat sites the fourth largest number of sites in the nation as certified by the wildlife habitat council we provided over 160 scholarships to students nationwide and emphasized covid19 support as well as diversity and inclusion in our community outreach and contributions 

we recognize that the aggregates mining in which we engage is an interim use of the approximately 240000 acres of land in our portfolio our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses at the end of mining effective management throughout the life cycle of our land — from premining utilization as agriculture and timber development to postmining development as water reservoirs or residential and commercial development — not only generates significant additional value for our shareholders but greatly benefits the communities in which we operate 

customer service 

more than an aggregates supplier we are a business dedicated to customer service and finding creative solutions to meet our customers’ needs being a valued partner and trusted supplier means that we are providing the right product with the right specifications that is the right quality delivered the right way — on time and safely our onevulcan locally led approach in which our employees work together to leverage the size and strengths of vulcan as a whole while running their operations with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and sense of ownership allows us to deliver marketleading services to our customers 

transportation costs are passed along to our customers and because aggregates have a very high weighttovalue ratio those costs can add up quickly when transporting aggregates long distances having the most extensive distribution network of any aggregates producer sets us apart combining our trucking rail barge and ocean vessel shipping logistics capabilities allows us to provide better customer solutions and create a seamless customer experience at a competitive price  

as an approximation a truck has a capacity of 2025 tons of aggregates a railcar has a capacity of 45 truckloads a barge has a capacity of 65 truckloads and our ocean vessels have the capacity of 2500 truckloads 



strong financial foundation 

our financial position is strong as evidenced by our investmentgrade credit ratings fitch bbbmoody’s baa2standard  poor’s bbb at december 31 2020 our available liquidity was 21410 million including 11980 million of cash on hand substantially higher than our liquidity needs our leverage ratio as measured by total debt to adjusted ebitda has improved from 65x at december 31 2012 to 25x at december 31 2020 and our net debt to adjusted ebitda at december 31 2020 is 16x within our stated leverage target of 20 to 25x over that same period we also improved the structure of our debt average maturity from 7 years to 13 years and reduced the cost of the debt weighted average interest rate from 755 to 410 



results of operations 

total revenues are primarily derived from our product sales of aggregates asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and include freight  delivery costs that we pass along to our customers to deliver these products we also generate service revenues from our asphalt construction paving business and services related to our aggregates business we present separately our discontinued operations which consists of our former chemicals business 

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda

the 206 million increase in our 2020 income tax expense was primarily related to a decrease in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and a smaller research  development tax credit the 298 million increase in our 2019 income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in earnings 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law in march 2020 the cares act provides numerous tax relief provisions and stimulus measures a temporary favorable change to the prior year and current year limitations on interest deductions and a temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of social security taxes are the relief provisions that are expected to provide us the greatest benefit in the first quarter of 2020 an expected cash tax benefit of 133 million was recorded to account for the favorable change to the prior year limitation on interest deductions 

see note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings loss from discontinued operations were 

 47 million in 2020 

 65 million in 2019 

 27 million in 2018 

pretax earnings loss from discontinued operations for 2020 2019 and 2018 resulted primarily from general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business for additional information about discontinued operations  see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption discontinued operations 



reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

samestore 

we have provided certain information on a samestore basis when discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods we may exclude the operating results of recently acquireddivested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed these recently acquireddivested businesses are disclosed in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis we believe that measuring performance on a samestore basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity our samestore information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure we present this measure as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight  delivery which are passthrough activities it also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services such as landfill tipping fees that are derived from our aggregates business additionally we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below 







aggregates segment incremental gross profit 

aggregates segment incremental gross profit flowthrough rate is not a gaap measure and represents the yearoveryear change in gross profit divided by the yearoveryear change in segment sales excluding freight  delivery revenues and costs we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight  delivery which are passthrough activities reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below

cash gross profit 

gaap does not define “cash gross profit” and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by gaap we and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business additionally we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to longterm shareholder value we do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources cash gross profit adds back noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization to gross profit aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing aggregates segment cash gross profit by tons shipped reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below 



net debt to adjusted ebitda 

net debt to adjusted ebitda is not a gaap measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by gaap we the investment community and credit rating agencies use this metric to assess our leverage net debt subtracts cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from total debt reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below 



‎ 



ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

gaap does not define “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by gaap we use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to longterm shareholder value we do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented belo w  numbers may not foot due to rounding 





adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial committed bank line of credit additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets the sale of surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2021 including 

 contractual obligations 

 capital expenditures 

 debt service obligations 

 dividend payments 

 potential acquisitions 

 potential share repurchases 

our balanced approach to capital deployment remains unchanged we intend to balance reinvestment in our business growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders while sustaining financial strength and flexibility 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to balance the cost of capital and the risk of financial stress we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 

 maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity 

 proactively manage our debt maturity schedule such that repaymentrefinancing risk in any single year is low 

 maintain an appropriate balance of fixedrate and floatingrate debt 

 minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility 

in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating the covid19 pandemic we took a number of proactive steps during 2020 in april 2020 we executed a 7500 million oneyear delayed draw term loan in may 2020 we issued 7500 million of 350 senior notes due 2030 to prefund a the 2500 million due june 2020 and b the 5000 million due march 2021 in september 2020 we executed a new fiveyear unsecured bank line of credit of 10000 million and terminated our april 2020 7500 million delayed draw term loan as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity sources and needs and take appropriate actions 



cash 

included in our december 31 2020 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of 11980 million is 09 million of restricted cash see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption restricted cash  

cash from operating activities 

in millions 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 





2020 versus 2019 — net cash provided by operating activities was 10704 million during 2020 an 863 million increase compared to 2019 this increase primarily resulted from favorable changes in working capital balances compared to the prior year period 

days sales outstanding a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables were 449 days at december 31 2020 compared to 485 days at december 31 2019 additionally our over 90 day balance of 155 million at december 31 2020 was down 55 from 341 million at december 31 2019 all customer accounts are actively managed and no losses in excess of amounts reserved are currently expected attention is being paid to the potential negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers’ ability to pay their amounts owed to us 



cash from investing activities 

in millions 

2020 versus 2019 — net cash used for investing activities was 3815 million during 2020 a 343 million decrease compared to 2019 we invested 3622 million in our existing operations in 2020 a 219 million decrease compared to 2019 of this 3622 million 1229 million was invested in internal growth projects to enhance our distribution capabilities develop new production sites and enhance existing production facilities additionally during 2020 we acquired businesses for 432 million of cash consideration as compared to 442 million of cash consideration for businesses in 2019 see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

cash from financing activities 

in millions 

2020 versus 2019 — net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was 2347 million compared to 3382 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2019 the 2020 activity includes a net cash proceeds of 7346 million for the issuance of new debt b cash paid to retire the 2500 million floating rate notes due 2020 and c 199 million of cash paid to settle interest rate derivatives the 2019 results include a net 1330 million payment on our bank line of credit 

additionally capital returned to our shareholders increased by 398 million via higher dividends of 162 million 136 per share compared to 124 per share and higher share repurchases of 235 million 214338 shares  12192 per share compared to 18600 shares  13990 per share 



debt 

certain debt measures as of december 31 are outlined below 





l ine of credit 

in september 2020 we executed a new fiveyear unsecured line of credit of 10000 million incurring 46 million of transaction costs covenants borrowing options cost ranges and other details are described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants and the credit margin for libor borrowings was 125 the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 025 and the commitment fee for the unused portion was 015 

in september 2020 we terminated our 7500 million 364day delayed draw term loan executed in april 2020 during the second quarter we had borrowed and repaid 2500 million leaving 5000 million available for future borrowings prior to its termination 

as of december 31 2020 our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was 9439 million utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows 

 none was borrowed 

 561 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit 

term debt 

all of our 33579 million face value of term debt is unsecured 33462 million of such debt is governed by three essentially identical indentures that contain customary investmentgrade type covenants the primary covenant in all three indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all term debt covenants 



in may 2020 we issued 7500 million of 350 senior notes due 2030 for total proceeds of 7414 million net of discounts and transaction costs 2500 million of the proceeds were used to retire the 2500 million floating rate notes due in june 2020 and the remainder of the proceeds together with cash on hand will be used to retire the 5000 million floating rate notes due in march 2021 

for additional information regarding term debt see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

debt payments and maturities 

scheduled debt payments during 2020 were 2500 million in june — refinanced in may by issuing 7500 million of 350 senior notes due 2030 there were no significant scheduled debt payments during 2019 

as of december 31 2020 maturities for the next four quarters and for the next five years are a s follows excluding any borrowings on the line of credit  



for additional information regarding debt payments and maturities see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

debt ratings 

our debt ratings and outlooks as of december 31 2020 are as follows 





libor transition 

the london interbank offered rate libor is an indicative measure of the average rate at which major global banks could borrow from one another and is used extensively globally as a reference rate for financial contracts eg corporate bonds and loans and commercial contracts eg real estate leases the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in july 2017 that it intends to cease requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 

the expected discontinuation of libor has led to the formation of working groups in the us and elsewhere to recommend alternative reference rates the us working group is the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the arrc has selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred alternative to libor 

as of december 31 2020 we had two material debt instruments with libor as a reference rate 1 5000 million floatingrate notes due march 2021 and 2 10000 million line of credit none outstanding at december 31 2020 due september 2025 at this time we cannot predict the future impact of a departure from libor as a reference rate however if future rates based upon the successor reference rate or a new method of calculating libor are higher than libor rates as currently determined our interest expense would increase 



equity 

the number of our common stock issuances and purchases are as follows 



as of december 31 2020 there were 8064851 shares remaining under the february 2017 authorization by our board of directors depending upon market business legal and other conditions we may purchase shares from time to time through the open market including plans designed to comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 andor privately negotiated transactions the authorization has no time limit does not obligate us to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

the detail of our common stock purchases all of which were open market purchases are as follows 



there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities 

standby letters of credit 

for a discussion of our standby letters of credit see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



contractual obligations 

we expect core capital spending excluding growth capital of 325 million during 2021 excluding future cash requirements for capital expenditures and immaterial or contingent contracts our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 2020 are summarized in the table below 







critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the followin g c ritical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 goodwill impairment 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

5 environmental compliance costs 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

1 goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2020 goodwill represents 27 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 17 reporting units of which 9 carry goodwill based primarily on geographic location we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill i f the fair value exceeds its carrying value the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired however if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 



our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and if applicable acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 2018 through 2020 ind icated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded in excess of 100 their carrying values 

for additional information about goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2020 net property plant  equipment represents 38 of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 10 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg asphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates impacts the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded no material losses on impairment of longlived assets 



we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being used in our operations these assets totaled 4671 million at december 31 2020 representing a 12 increase from december 31 2019 of the total 4671 million approximately 40 relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations in addition approximately 20 is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 40 is composed of aggregates asphalt and concrete operating assets idled temporarily we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information about longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

our strategic longterm plan s include potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesse s w hen an acquisition is completed our consolidated statement s of comprehensive income includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date that control is obtained 

how we determine and allocate the purchase price 

the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assume d as of the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the ne t f air value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions additionally the amounts assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill which is not amortized can significantly affect our results of operations 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price a fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below 

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ‎ level 2 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data ‎ level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publiclytraded entities and assumed obligations for publiclytraded longterm debt 

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquire d m achinery and equipment land buildings and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligation s a dditionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place and other identifiable intangible assets we determine the fair values of owned mineral reserves and leased mineral interests using a lost profits approach and or an excess earnings approach these valuation techniques require management to estimate future cash flows the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price shipment volumes production costs and capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows 



other identifiable intangible assets may include but are not limited t o n oncompetition agreements  t he fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or a market approach 

measurement period adjustments 

we may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill if any recognized in the transaction the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined the measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits requires that we use assumptions for the valuation of projected benefit obligations pbo and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions for discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations and the expected return on plan assets due to plan changes made in 2012 and 2013 annual pay increases and the per capita cost of healthcare benefits do not materially impact plan obligations 

 discount rates — we use a highquality bond full yield curve approach specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow to establish the discount rates at each measurement date see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for the discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations 

 expected return on plan assets — our expected return on plan assets is 1 a longterm view based on our current asset allocation and 2 a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary for the year ended december 31 2020 the expected return on plan assets was 575 for the period january 1 2020 – november 30 2020 and 525 for the period december 1 2020 – december 31 2020 575 for 2019 the plans were remeasured at november 30 2020 to reflect settlement accounting for the cmg hourly pension plan and the vulcan materials company vmc pension plan the chemicals and salaried pension plans were merged to form the vmc pension plan effective november 30 2020 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the pbo and the annual net benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 



as of the december 31 2020 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets decreased from 9490 million for the prior yearend to 9443 million due to voluntary lump sum settlement distributions to certain fully vested plan participants partially offset by investment returns our postretirement plans are unfunded 

the discount rate is the weightedaverage of the spot rates for each cash flow on the yield curve for highquality bonds as of the measurement date as of the december 31 2020 measurement date the pbo of our pension plans decreased from 10909 million to 10595 million this decrease was primarily due to the large amount of benefit distributions made from the plans as a result of the lump sum settlements offered to certain fully vested plan participants the pbo of our postretirement plans decreased from 412 million to 339 million this decrease was primarily due to demographic assumption changes 



during 2021 we expect to recognize net pension income of 108 million and net postretirement income of 19 million compared to expense of 216 million which reflects a settlement charge of 227 million and income of 22 million respectively in 2020 the decrease in pension expense excluding the settlement charge is mainly due to greater than expected asset returns 

we do not anticipate that contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2021 and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

5 environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs we 

 expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy 

 expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues 

 accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost 

at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount if no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2020 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 59 million — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information about environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 100 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information about claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we file federal state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items we are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

we recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation 

generally we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years before 2017 while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate 

we consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination or the expiration of the statute of limitations upon resolution of a tax position any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business to manage these market risks we may use derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and risk of financial stress such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings we at times use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixedrate and floatingrate debt 

at december 31 2020 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was 39590 million compared to a face value of 33579 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately 4149 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

 item 1 

business 

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  operates primarily in the us and is t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy delivered by trucks ships barges and trains our products are the indispensable materials building homes offices places of worship schools hospitals and factories as well as vital infrastructure including highways bridges roads ports and harbors water systems campuses dams airports and rail networks as of december 31 2019 we had 366 active aggregates facilities 70 asphalt facilities and 53 concrete facilities 

business strategy 

our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our strategy for longterm value creation is built on   1 an aggregates  focus ed business   2 a disciplined approach to portfolio management and capital allocation   3 a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability  4 a holistic approach to land management  and  5 our commitment to safety health and the environment  

1 aggregates focus 

vulcan is uniquely positioned as the largest aggregates supplier in the us and the most aggregatesfocused public company 

source 2018 reported financial information and company estimates 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist given o ur focus on aggregates  we 

n take advantage of size and scale  our 366 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2019 provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally each aggregates operation is also unique because of its location within a local market and its particular geological characteristics every operation however uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement technical support and engineering 



 build and hold substantial reserves  our reserves are critical to our longterm success we currently have 162 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations these restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 

2 portfolio management and capital allocation 

d emand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment during the period 20 20  20 30  moodys analytics projects that 72  of the us population growth 68  of household formation and 65  of new jobs will occur in vulcanserved states the close proximity of our a ggregates reserve s and our p roduction facilitie s to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in highreturn projects 

source moody’s analytics as of december 12 2019 

we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and to divest assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy our coasttocoast footprint serves 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth us metropolitan areas in 20 states plus the district of columbia 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 87 of our 2019 revenues while our top five accounted for 61 





 portfolio management  since becoming a public company in 1956 vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions for example in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc this acquisition expanded our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other midatlantic and southeastern states in 2017 we acquired aggregates usa — this acquisition greatly expanded our ability to serve customers in florida georgia and south carolina additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton aggregates acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth for example during 2019 we acquired aggregates operations that strengthened our position in tennessee 

while an aggregatesfocused business we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability o ur downstream businesses asphalt and concrete use vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusivel y in 2017 we entered the asphalt market in tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in 2018 we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton downstream acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth for example during 2019 we expanded our virginia readymixed concrete operations 

from 2017 to 2019 we invested over 11 billion in acquisitions while further strengthening our portfolio through divestitures and swaps including swapping our concrete operations in arizona for asphalt operations in arizona during 2017 

 capital allocation  our longterm strategy around capital allocation has given us the ability to leverage decisions we have made over the past few years during 2019 we reinvested 3841 million into core operating  maintenance capital and internal growth capital in addition to 4691 million and 4596 million reinvested in 2018 and 2017 respectively these investments are fundamental actions that sustain and strengthen the business they improve the longerterm efficiency capacity and flexibility of our production and they support our strong commitment to superior customer service 

3 compounding improvement in profitability 

our focus on the following four strategic initiatives has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

 operational excellence — continuous and sustainable improvements in both our operating disciplines and our industryleading safety performance coupled with better asset utilization through improved availability and throughput leads to effective cost control 

 strategic sourcing — leveraging common practices and innovation leads to more time in our plants and with our suppliers to optimize the total cost of ownership right part at the right time 

 commercial excellence — clearly defined roles and responsibilities together with access to real time forwardlooking metrics leads to our sales teams spending less time on nonselling activities and more time responding to our customers’ needs 

 logistics innovation – partnering with our customers truck drivers and contractors to provide a bundled logistics solution with digital shipping records and onsite mobile visibility leads to streamlined scheduling speed and accuracy of delivery and efficient backoffice processes 

we manage these initiatives locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively 



4  la nd management 

with approximately 240000 acres in our land portfolio a longterm holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success from premining to mining to reclamation we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land creating maximum value for the business our shareholders and our communities 

we are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development after mining our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs aquifer recharge basins public parks habitat mitigation banks wetlands productive farmland and residential and commercial developments 

because of the evolving needs of our communities we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete our work with state regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations 

5  safety health and the environment 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate we are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives and our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate 

product lines 

our products are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals schools shopping centers factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives and the economy we have four operating and reportable segments aggregates asphalt concrete and calcium organized around our principal product lines 

our 2019 total revenues and gross profit by segment are illustrated as follows calcium revenues and gross profit were less than one percent 



for actual amounts see note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 

 as a base material underneath highways walkways airport runways parking lots and railroads 

 to aid in water filtration purification and erosion control 

 as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including 

 houses and apartments 

 roads bridges and parking lots 

 schools and hospitals 

 commercial buildings and retail space 

 sewer systems 

 power plants 

 airports and runways 

aggregates industry 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business include 

 location and transportation of reserves aggregates have a high weighttovalue ratio and in most cases must be produced near where they are used if not transportation can cost more than the materials rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials where practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive approximately 80 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck 

exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available highquality aggregates we serve these markets from quarries that have access to costeffective longhaul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on mexico’s yucatan peninsula with our fleet of panamaxclass selfunloading ships a pproximately 17 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered by truck to the customer after reaching a sales yard by rail or water the remaining 3 of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 

 limited product substitution there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lowercost alternative to virgin aggregates however many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet technical specifications and performancebased criteria for durability strength and other qualities likewise the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications 

 highly fragmented industry the us aggregates industry is composed of over 5800 companies that manage close to 10000 operations this fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities 

through strategic acquisitions and investments we have developed an unmatched coasttocoast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers we have over 23000 customers in 20 states the district of columbia mexico and the bahamas 

 flexible production capabilities the production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and through a series of screens separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used production capacity is flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale when additional growth materializes 



 raw material inputs largely controlled unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves stone sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources however production does require the use of explosives hydrocarbon fuels and electric power 

 demand cycles longterm growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population jobs and households while shortterm and mediumterm demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries with each peak establishing a new historical high 

the drivers underpinning demand recovery — and sustained multiyear volume and pricing growth — remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy they include population growth gains in total employment and in household income and wages a continuing increase in household formations the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand a multiyear federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels record state tax receipts public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the longterm trendline and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure 

aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatelyfunded construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publiclyfunded projects particularly highways roads and bridges which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

‎ source company estimates 



public sector construction market 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges buildings airports schools prisons sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2019 publiclyfunded construction accounted for approximately 44 of our total aggregates shipments and approximately 23 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 

 public sector funding generally public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multiyear laws which provide certainty in funding amounts program structures and rules and regulations federal spending is governed by authorization budget and appropriations laws the level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies 

 state and local transportation funding since 2012 32 states have increased or adjusted taxes on motor fuel to increase revenues available for transportation investment in 2019 alabama and illinois became the two most recent states in vulcan’s footprint to raise significant revenue for highway construction and maintenance through motor fuel tax increases other states have increased revenues outside of fuel taxes or made onetime increases since 2012 eleven vulcanserved states representing over 85 of our 2019 total revenues have averaged a 60 increase in revenues for highways 

in addition we benefit from state and local transportation funding ballot measures major transportation funding measures in vulcanserved areas are estimated to result in 30 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads streets and bridges across the us voters in 19 states approved 89 of 305 measures in 2019 which will generate 96 billion in new and recurring transportation investment this continues a decadelong trend in which voters have approved 81 of nearly 2000 transportation investment ballot measures 

 federal highway funding  in december 2015 president obama signed a new longterm federal highway and transit authorization bill fixing america’s surface transportation infrastructure act fast act into law after the final legislation received strong bipartisan support in both the house and the senate the fast act provides multiyear funding to state and local governments in support of road bridge intermodal and public transportation projects 

the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2020 in addition the bipartisan budget act of 2018 added approximately 2 billion per year to base highway programs in 2018 and 2019 

the longterm nature of the fast act is important the federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 this law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects — particularly freight projects in states where we operate we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with fast act funding and policy implementation 

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending with the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program authorized at 275 million in line with the previous program outlays and growing to 300 million by 2020 the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects 

the fast act expires on september 30 2020 congress is in the process of developing policy and funding legislative proposals for fast act reauthorization it would not be atypical for an extension of current law to be required to provide congress with adequate time to complete the reauthorization process historically there is minimal disruption to the flow of federal funding to state and local projects due to extensions 



 federal water infrastructure in october 2018 president trump signed america’s water infrastructure act of 2018 awia 2018 into law the new law includes the water resources development act of 2018 wrda 2018 which reauthorizes needed investment in america’s ports channels locks dams and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities it also improves epa programs for storm water water recycling and sewer overflow projects included in awia 2018 are improvements to the water infrastructure finance and innovation act wifia program which was modeled after the highly popular tifia program in the surface transportation sector created in the water resources reform and development act of 2014 wrrda 2014 wifia allows for federal credit assistance to water resources projects in the form of lowcost loans loan guarantees and lines of credit 

in addition to these regular authorizations federal emergency supplemental appropriations were provided in 2018 in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 for hurricaneaffected areas in florida louisiana texas and other states 893 billion and in the additional supplement appropriations for disaster relief act in 2019 199 billion a portion of these funds will be directed to longterm and shortterm us army corps of engineerssupported flood control and other water resources construction projects as well as additional infrastructure projects that use aggregates and related materials 

private sector construction market 

the private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction in 2019 privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 56 of our total aggregates shipments 

 nonresidential construction private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends the growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals places of worship and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firms ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing this end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 

 residential construction household formations in vulcanserved states continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the united states the majority of residential construction is for singlefamily housing with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor 

us housing starts as measured by dodge data  analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2019 total annual housing starts in the us reached 134 million units 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad tracks we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate attractive financial returns and enhance financial returns in our core aggregates segment  we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete within each of our three geographic markets as noted below aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 



2 asphalt 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in alabama arizona california new mexico tennessee and texas in june 2018 we strengthened our asphalt position in texas by acquiring additional asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in march 2018 we entered the alabama asphalt market through the acquisition of an aggregates asphalt mix and construction paving business in december 2017 we strengthened our asphalt position in arizona by swapping readymixed concrete operations for an asphalt mix operation in january 2017 we entered the tennessee asphalt market through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segme nt relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement which we purchase from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities 

3 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california maryland new mexico texas virginia washington dc and the bahamas in october 2019 we expanded our readymixed concrete operations in virginia via an acquisition in march 2018 we exited the georgia readymixed concrete market we retained all real property which is leased to the buyer and obtained a longterm aggregates supply agreement as noted above in december 2017 we exited the arizona readymixed concrete market via a swap for an asphalt mix operation continuing our strategy to focus on asphalt mix in that market in march 2017 we reentered the california readymixed concrete market through an acquisition for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility readymixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third party producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck 

4 calcium 

our calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t industries with high  quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 

competitors 

we operate in a fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers accounted for roughly onethird of the total us aggregates production in 2019 despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 

 cemex sab de cv 

 crh plc 

 heidelbergcement ag 

 lafargeholcim 

 martin marietta materials inc 

 mdu resources group inc 

 summit materials inc 

because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5800 companies managing close to 10000 operations during 2019  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 2019 our five largest customers accounted for 77 of our total revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 19 of our total revenues although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publiclyfunded construction such as highways airports and government buildings a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publiclyfunded construction the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local state or federal governments in addition our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coasttocoast ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers 



environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration msha and occupational safety and health administration osha compliance with these various regulations requires capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2020 and 2021 will be 93 million and 73 million respectively these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share in that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

for additional information about litigation and environmental matters see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments

 item 1a 

risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

economicpolitical risks 

our business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles — our products are principally sold to the us construction industry since our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets our profits are sensitive to the underlying national regional and local economic conditions construction spending which is cyclical is affected by general economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic shifts industry cycles employment levels inflation and other business economic and financial factors that are beyond our control a downturn in construction activities or spending in vulcanserved markets particularly in our top revenuegenerating markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environment al an d other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment create restrictions on our products or impede our access to reserves or opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure — our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments in 2019 voters in local jurisdictions in california georgia new mexico north carolina texas and virginia among others approved bond and revenueraising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects in 2019 two state legislatures in vulcanserved areas — alabama and illinois — passed new longterm highway funding legislation the federal fast act a five year fullyfunded road bridge and public transportation authorization law is providing assistance to state dots and metro areas however given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions 



other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities availability of water and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity a number of our facilities are located in desert climates and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of energy or water in the past we cannot guarantee that we will not in the future furthermore public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa we face political and other risks associated with our international operations including our largest production facility located in playa del carmen mexico these risks may include changes in international trade policies such as the united states — mexico — canada agreement usmca imposition of duties taxes or government royalties arbitrary changes to permits zoning classifications or operating agreements or overt acts by foreign governments including expropriations and other forms of takings of property in addition failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrated therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas  if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations  if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs  therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments 



significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 19 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact the cost andor availability of financing — we currently have 285 billion of debt with maturities between 2020 and 2048 given our current credit metrics and ratings together with other factors we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due furthermore we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investmentgrade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit ratings could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items  changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 goodwill impairment 

 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

 pension and other postretirement benefits 

 environmental compliance costs 

 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 income taxes 

these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the phaseout of libor or the replacement of libor with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate libor may adversely affect interest rates — libor is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of financial transactions including derivatives and loans in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is unclear whether or not libor will cease to exist at that time and if so what reference rate will replace it or if new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arrc has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to united states dollar libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to libor uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of sofr as the primary alternative to libor we have three material debt instruments with libor as a reference rate each of which matures before the end of 2021 1 2500 million floatingrate notes due 2020 2 5000 million floatingrate notes due 2021 and 3 7500 million line of credit none outstanding at december 31 2019 due 2021 at this time we cannot predict the future impact of a departure from libor as a reference rate however if future rates based upon the successor reference rate or a new method of calculating libor are higher than libor rates as currently determined it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 



personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations — labor unions represent approximately 11 of our workforce disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs andor reduced revenues 

other risks 

a significant interruption of our information technology systems or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data including cybersecurity risks could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results — as part of our regular review of potential risks we maintain an information and operational technology risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal crossfunctional stakeholders as part of this program analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as our plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management the audit committee and the board of directors the audit committee which has oversight responsibility for our information security program is briefed on such program at least twice annually and our chief financial officer is briefed on such program at least quarterly given our reliance on information technology our own and our thirdparty providers’ a significant interruption in the availability of information technology regardless of the cause or the loss of confidential personal or proprietary information whether our own our employees’ our suppliers’ or our customers’ regardless of the cause could negatively impact our operations while we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material adverse impact on our f inancial condition or results of operations however we could suffer material financial or other losses in the future and we are not able to predict the severity of these attacks the occurrence of a cyberattack breach unauthorized access misuse computer virus or other malicious code or other cybersecurity event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure gathering monitoring misuse corruption loss or destruction of confidential and other information that belongs to us our customers our counterparties or thirdparty providers that is processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks the occurrence of such an event could also result in damage to our software computers or systems or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our customers’ our counterparties’ or third parties’ operations this could result in loss of customers and business opportunities reputational damage litigation regulatory fines penalties or intervention reimbursement or other compensatory costs or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 

o ur products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers  significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs  truckrailcarbarge shortages truck driver and rail crew shortages capacity constraint s and minimum tonnage requirements additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 



we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation  which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resource s a nd our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability  variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of a chemical s b usines s  although we divested the chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — w e operate construction paving businesses in alabama tennessee and texas in some instances including many of our fixed price paving contracts we agree to complete a project by a certain date if we fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay consequently the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal as required by gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier of construction aggregates we serve markets in twenty states washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

our current estimate of 162 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects a decrease of 01 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  



reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained through permit contract or grandfathered status  leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 162 billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2019 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2019 and the types of facilities operated 





of the 162 billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 2019  91 billion tons or 56 are located on owned land and 71 billion tons or 44  are located on leased land 

‎ 



the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our total revenues in 201 9  



asphalt concrete and calcium 

as of december 31 2019 we o perate d a number of facilities producing asphalt mix readymixed concrete and calcium in several of our divisions as reflected in the table below  





the asphalt and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials 



our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  



our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products such as animal feed and plastics high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse products the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 97 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space consists of approximately 184410 square feet and is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is approximately  37 million 




 item 3 

legal proceedings 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels 

we were not subject to any penalties in 2019 for failure to disclose transactions identified by the internal revenue service as abusive under internal revenue code section 6707a

2019 marked another year of strong earnings growth and cash generation we are particularly proud of our people who worked hard to achieve these results while ensuring another year of world class safety performance widespread improvements in pricing helped drive 8 growth in our industryleading unit profitability gross profit per ton in aggregates and doubledigit growth in adjusted ebitda industry leadership in safety and pacesetting unit margins are both evidence of a strong and healthy business going forward our compounding unit margins and our disciplined capital allocation position us well to increase our cash flows and improve our return on invested capital 

full year revenues were 49 billion up 12 as compared to the prior year and net earnings were 6177 million an increase of 20 adjusted ebitda increased 12 to 12700 million 

at year end total debt was 28 billion or 22 times 2019 adjusted ebitda our weightedaverage debt maturity was 14 years and the weightedaverage interest rate was 44 

as the leading aggregates producer in the us we are well positioned for continued top line growth particularly as federal state and local governments increase spending on public infrastructure construction while demand for private sector projects gain momentum in addition our keen focus on operational excellence cost control and disciplined investment should enable us to enhance profitability and drive sustainable longterm shareholder value 

capital allocation 

we will continue to make disciplined investments in organic and acquisitionled growth while continuing to emphasize capital returns and cost control we are completely focused on actions that improve returns to our shareholders we seek continuous compounding improvement generating big results through small actions our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged 

 deploying operating capital to sustain our franchise 

 maintaining the financial strength and flexibility needed through the cycle 

 strategic growth through mergers and acquisitions and internal development 

 returning excess cash to shareholders through a healthy mix of sustainable dividend growth and stock repurchases 

our capital allocation and investmentgrade rating priorities remain unchanged for the full year capital expenditures were 4043 million this amount included 2393 million of core operating and maintenance capital investments to improve or replace existing property plant  equipment in addition we invested 1650 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves develop new production sites enhance our distribution capabilities and support the targeted growth of our asphalt and concrete operations 

we continue to pursue opportunities for valuecreating acquisitions swaps and greenfield investments we remain active in the pursuit of bolton acquisitions and other valuecreating growth investments we closed two business acquisitions during 2019 for total consideration of 453 million  these acquisitions strengthened both our aggregates position in tennessee and our readymixed concrete position in virginia 

during 2019 we returned 1666 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



market developments and outlook 

demand in our markets will continue to benefit from higher levels of highway funding and continued growth in residential and nonresidential markets residential construction should continue to strengthen after some softness in certain of our markets during the second half of 2019 private nonresidential construction activity should also improve as leading indicators point to positive growth in 2020 demand fundamentals including population and employment growth continue to support longerterm growth in residential and nonresidential construction 

we are seeing a positive pricing environment driven by shipment momentum in private demand and visibility of public demand this visibility to demand growth sets the stage for solid price improvement in 2020 price improvement coupled with our four strategic initiatives operational excellence strategic sourcing commercial excellence and logistics innovation should continue to increase unit profitability 

management expectations for 2020 include 

 aggregates shipments growth of 2 to 4 

 aggregates freightadjusted price increase of 4 to 6 

 collective asphalt concrete and calcium segment gross profit growth of 10 to 15 

 sag expenses of approximately 365 million 

 interest expense of approximately 125 million 

 depreciation depletion accretion and amortization expense of approximately 385 million 

 an effective tax rate of approximately 20 

 earnings from continuing operations of 520 to 580 per diluted share 

 net earnings of 695 million to 775 million 

 adjusted ebitda of 1385 billion to 1485 billion 

additionally we expect to spend approximately 275 million on maintenance capital and 200 million for internal growth projects that are largely underway 

in summary we expect another year of strong earnings growth in 2020 vulcanserved markets should continue to benefit from robust public construction demand led by higher levels of highway funding in our key states our focus remains the same — compounding our unit margins through all parts of the cycle 



competitive advantages 

aggregates footprint 

over time we have strategically and systematically built one of the most valuable aggregates franchises in the us with a footprint that is impossible to replicate zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries such regulations while curtailing expansion also increase the value of our reserves that were zoned and permitted decades ago 

demand for aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have a coasttocoast footprint that serves 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth metropolitan areas and states where 72  of us population growth from 2020 to 2030 is projected to occur as state and federal spending increases vulcan is poised to benefit greatly from growing private and public demand for aggregates thereby delivering significant longterm value for our shareholders 



compounding improvement in profitability 

we have continued to deliver strong financial performance over time and through business cycles through our aggregatesled strategy and focus on our four strategic initiatives — operational excellence strategic sourcing commercial excellence and logistics innovation as outlined in item 1 “business” under the “business strategy” heading — we have created one of the most profitable public companies in our industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 

current economic indicators and market fundamentals point toward continued market growth we are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale as this growth continues 

safety health and environmental performance 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate over our more than six decades as a public company we have built a strong resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way 

we are a leader in our industry in safety health and environmental performance with a safety record substantially better than the industry average we apply the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another the result is a record of safety excellence consistently outperforming the industry 

 

source mine safety and health administration msha records and internal vulcan data 



we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives resulting in 98 citationfree inspections out of all 2019 federal and state environmental inspections 



we lead community relations programs that serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate during 2019 we operated 40 certified wildlife habitat sites the third largest number of sites in the nation as certified by the wildlife habitat council we conducted tours for more than 25000 students and neighbors at our operations partnered with 235 adopted schools and provided 145 scholarships to students nationwide 

we recognize that the aggregates mining in which we engage is an interim use of the approximately 240000 acres of land in our portfolio our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses at the end of mining effective management throughout the life cycle of our land — from premining utilization as agriculture and timber development to postmining development as water reservoirs or residential and commercial development — not only generates significant additional value for our shareholders but greatly benefits the communities in which we operate 

customer service 

more than an aggregates supplier we are a business dedicated to customer service and finding creative solutions to meet our customers’ needs being a valued partner and trusted supplier means that we are providing the right product with the right specifications that is the right quality delivered the right way — on time and safely our onevulcan locally led approach in which our employees work together to leverage the size and strengths of vulcan as a whole while running their operations with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and sense of ownership allows us to deliver marketleading services to our customers 

transportation costs are passed along to our customers and because aggregates have a very high weighttovalue ratio those costs can add up quickly when transporting aggregates long distances having the most extensive distribution network of any aggregates producer sets us apart combining our trucking rail barge and ocean vessel shipping logistics capabilities allows us to provide better customer solutions and create a seamless customer experience at a competitive price  

as an approximation a truck has a capacity of 2025 tons of aggregates a railcar has a capacity of 45 truckloads a barge has a capacity of 65 truckloads and our ocean vessels have the capacity of 2500 truckloads 



strong financial foundation 

our strong balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to implement our strategy and initiatives and allows us to negotiate from a position of strength we have a wellestablished set of priorities with respect to capital allocation as follows 

1 operating capital maintain and grow value of franchise 

2 growth capital including greenfields and business acquisitions 

3 dividend growth with earnings with a keen focus on sustainability 

4 return excess cash to shareholders primarily via share repurchases 

our first and highest use of cash is to maintain and protect our valuable franchise by keeping our operations in good working order to ensure the timely delivery of goods and services to our customers this cash use takes the form of operating and maintenance capital and the requirements expand and contract as volume changes 

our second priority is to grow and expand our franchise we do this through internal growth projects and business acquisitions internal growth projects have generally been among our highest returning projects and include the opening of greenfield production andor distribution sites and the acquisition of new reserves for business acquisitions we tend to look for small bolton acquisitions which are easy to integrate and will pursue large business combinations that are the right fit and the right price we use strategic and returnsbased criteria to price potential acquisitions and are disciplined in our approach we look at a lot of potential acquisitions and only make offers on a few 

our third priority is dividend growth to a level that we confidently believe we can maintain through the cycle 

and finally if there is excess cash after fulfilling the first three capital allocation priorities we will consider returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases 

additionally our leverage as measured by total debt to adjusted ebitda has improved from 65x at december 31 2012 to 22x as of december 31 2019 well within our stated leverage target of 20 to 25x over that period we also improved the structure of our debt average maturity from 7 years to 14 years and reduced the cost of the debt weighted average interest rate from 755 to 436 



results of operations 

total revenues are primarily derived from our product sales of aggregates asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and include freight  delivery costs that we pass along to our customers to deliver these products we also generate service revenues from our asphalt construction paving business and services related to our aggregates business we present separately our discontinued operations which consists of our former chemicals business 

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 





operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 asphalt 3 concrete and 4 calcium management reviews earnings for our reporting segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments 

 increased 7 in 2019 

 increased 10 in 2018 1 

 increased 1 in 2017 



aggregates shipments increased 7 6 samestore led by doubledigit growth in alabama texas and virginia vulcanserved markets benefitted from strong public construction demand led by significantly higher levels of highway funding in our key states conversely residential construction in our markets experienced a slowdown during the second half of 2019 we expect both residential and private nonresidential construction to improve in 2020 as leading indicators point to their growth potential 

our yearoveryear freightadjusted selling price 1 for aggregates 

 increased 56 in 2019 

 increased 15 in 2018 

 increased 32 in 2017 





aggregates freightadjusted pricing increased 56 or 074 per ton with widespread improvement throughout our key markets on a mixadjusted basis price increased 52 versus the prior year our disciplined approach to pricing and execution positions us well for compounding improvement demand growth in our markets continues to benefit from higher levels of highway funding while leading indicators for private construction point towards a return to growth in 2020 positive trends in booking pace along with visibility of public demand and shipment momentum in private demand should help drive sales price increases into 2020 





unit cost of sales freightadjusted increased 4 samestore 4 versus the prior year unit profitability as measured by gross profit per ton grew by 8 to 532 per ton we remain focused on compounding unit margins in order to achieve the 12 compound annual growth realized since the recovery began in the second half of 2013 

incremental gross profit as a percentage of segment sales excluding freight  delivery was 44 on a samestore basis this metric at 48 was below our longerterm expectations of 60 due to the aforementioned increase in unit cost of sales we evaluate this metric on a trailingtwelve month basis as quarterly gross profit flowthrough rates can vary widely from quarter to quarter 



2 asphalt 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 

 increased 12 in 2019 

 increased 4 in 2018 1 

 increased 14 in 2017 2 



asphalt segment gross profit of 630 million was 65 million or 12 higher than 2018 asphalt mix shipments increased 12 10 samestore while selling prices increased 48 or 266 per ton the average unit cost for liquid asphalt was 6 higher than 2018 negatively affecting earnings by 157 million material margins declined 028 per ton or approximately 35 million as higher prices partially offset the effect of higher liquid asphalt costs higher volume drove the increase in gross profit from 2018 





3 concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 

 decreased 4 in 2019 

 decreased 10 in 2018 1 

 increased 19 in 2017 2 



concrete segment gross profit was 432 million down 14 from 2018 on a 4 decline in shipments 2 samestore while material margins per cubic yard improved 2 2 samestore unit profitability as measured by gross profit per cubic yard declined 10 12 samestore due primarily to reduced volume leverage on fixed cost 



4 calcium 

calcium segment gross profit increased 13 from 2018 to 31 million 



in total the 2019 gross profit contribution from our three nonaggregates asphalt concrete and calcium segments was 1093 million a 02 million increase over 2018 and a 297 million or 21 decrease from 2017

samestore 

we have provided certain information on a samestore basis when discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods we may exclude the operating results of recently acquireddivested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed these recently acquireddivested businesses are disclosed in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis we believe that measuring performance on a samestore basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity our samestore information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues 

aggregates segment freightadjusted revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure we present this measure as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight  delivery which are passthrough activities it also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services such as landfill tipping fees that are derived from our aggregates business additionally we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below 







aggregates segment incremental gross profit 

aggregates segment incremental gross profit flowthrough rate is not a gaap measure and represents the yearoveryear change in gross profit divided by the yearoveryear change in segment sales excluding freight  delivery revenues and costs we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight  delivery which are passthrough activities reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial committed bank line of credit additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets the sale of surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2020 including 

 contractual obligations 

 capital expenditures 

 debt service obligations 

 dividend payments 

 potential share repurchases 

 potential acquisitions 

our balanced approach to capital deployment remains unchanged we intend to balance reinvestment in our business growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders while sustaining financial strength and flexibility in 2019 and 2018 we returned 1640 million and 1481 million respectively in cash to shareholders through our dividends and 26 million and 1340 million respectively through share repurchases 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to balance the cost of capital and the risk of financial stress we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 

 maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity 

 proactively manage our debt maturity schedule such that repaymentrefinancing risk in any single year is low 

 maintain an appropriate balance of fixedrate and floatingrate debt 

 minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility

2019 versus 2018 — net cash used for financing activities in 2019 was 3382 million compared to 2651 million in 2018 the 2019 results include a net 1330 million payment on our bank line of credit while debt refinancing activities during 2018 netted proceeds of 488 million additionally the capital returned to our shareholders decreased by 1155 million as higher dividends of 159 million 124 per share compared to 112 per share were offset by lower share repurchases 18600 shares  13990 per share compared to 1191928 shares  11241 per share 

2018 versus 2017 — net cash used for financing activities in 2018 was 2651 million compared to 5034 million provided by financing activities in 2017 the 2017 results included 7214 million of net proceeds from debt refinancing activities compared to 2018 net proceeds of 488 million additionally we increased by 895 million the return of capital to our shareholders via higher dividends of 158 million 112 per share compared to 100 per share and higher share repurchases of 737 million 1191928 shares  11241 per share compared to 510283 shares  11818 per share 



debt 

certain debt measures as of december 31 are outlined below 





at december 31 2019 our total debt of 27843 million was 22 times 2019 adjusted ebitda and our weightedaverage debt maturity was 14 years 

line of credit 

our unsecured 7500 million line of credit matures december 2021 covenants borrowings cost ranges and other details are described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants and the credit margin for libor borrowings was 125 the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 025 and the commitment fee for the unused portion was 015 

as of december 31 2019 our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was 6974 million utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows 

 none was borrowed 

 526 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit 

term debt 

all of our 28464 million face value of term debt is unsecured 28462 million of such debt is governed by three essentially identical indentures that contain customary investmentgrade type covenants the primary covenant in all three indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all term debt covenants 

throughout 2017 and during the first quarter of 2018 we completed a number of debt refinancing activities in order to extend the maturity of our debt portfolio consistent with the longlived nature of our asset base 



as a result of the first quarter 2018 early debt retirements we recognized premiums of 56 million transaction costs of 13 million and noncash expense acceleration of unamortized deferred transaction costs of 05 million the combined charge of 74 million was a component of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018 

as a result of the 2017 early debt retirements we recognized premiums of 1392 million transaction costs of 16 million and noncash expense acceleration of unamortized deferred transaction costs of 72 million the combined charge of 1480 million was a component of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017

for additional information regarding debt payments and maturities see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

debt ratings 

our debt ratings and outlooks as of december 31 2019 are as follows 





libor transition 

the london interbank offered rate libor is an indicative measure of the average rate at which major global banks could borrow from one another and is used extensively globally as a reference rate for financial contracts eg corporate bonds and loans and commercial contracts eg real estate leases the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in july 2017 that it intends to cease requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 

the expected discontinuation of libor has led to the formation of working groups in the us and elsewhere to recommend alternative reference rates the us working group is the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the arrc has selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred alternative to libor 



we are in the early stages of identifying evaluating and addressing the impacts to existing contracts of the discontinuation of libor we have three material debt instruments with libor as a reference rate each of which matures before the end of 2021 1 2500 million floatingrate notes due 2020 2 5000 million floatingrate notes due 2021 and 3 7500 million line of credit none outstanding at december 31 2019 due 2021 at this time we cannot predict the future impact of a departure from libor as a reference rate however if future rates based upon the successor reference rate or a new method of calculating libor are higher than libor rates as currently determined it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

equity 

the number of our common stock issuances and purchases are as follows 



on february 10 2017 our board of directors authorized us to purchase 8243243 shares of our common stock to refresh the number of shares we were authorized to purchase to 10000000 as of december 31 2019 there were 8279189 shares remaining under the authorization depending upon market business legal and other conditions we may purchase shares from time to time through the open market including plans designed to comply with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 andor privately negotiated transactions the authorization has no time limit does not obligate us to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

the detail of our common stock purchases all of which were open market purchases are as follows 



there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our 

 results of operations and financial position 

 capital expenditures 

 liquidity and capital resources 



standby letters of credit 

for a discussion of our standby letters of credit see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

contractual obligations 

we expect core capital spending excluding growth of 2750 million during 2020 excluding future cash requirements for capital expenditures and immaterial or contingent contracts our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 2019 are summarized in the table below 







critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the followin g c ritical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 goodwill impairment 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

5 environmental compliance costs 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

1 goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2019 goodwill represents 30 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 17 reporting units of which 9 carry goodwill based primarily on geographic location we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill i f the fair value exceeds its carrying value the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired however if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 



our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and if applicable acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for the last three years ind icated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded in excess of 100 their carrying values 

for additional information about goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2019 net property plant  equipment represents 41 of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 10 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg asphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates impacts the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2019 2018 and 2017 we recorded no losses on impairment of longlived assets 



we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being used in our operations these assets totaled 4182 million at december 31 2019 representing a 1 increase from december 31 2018 of the total 4182 million approximately 45 relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations in addition approximately 20 is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 35 is composed of aggregates asphalt and concrete operating assets idled temporarily we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information about longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

our strategic longterm plan s include potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesse s w hen an acquisition is completed our consolidated statement s of comprehensive income includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date that control is obtained 

how we determine and allocate the purchase price 

the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assume d as of the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions additionally the amounts assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill which is not amortized can significantly affect our results of operations 

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price a fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below 

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ‎ level 2 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data ‎ level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publiclytraded entities and assumed obligations for publiclytraded longterm debt 

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquire d m achinery and equipment land buildings and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligation s a dditionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place and other identifiable intangible assets we determine the fair values of owned mineral reserves and leased mineral interests using a lost profits approach and or an excess earnings approach these valuation techniques require management to estimate future cash flows the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price shipment volumes production costs and capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows 



other identifiable intangible assets may include but are not limited t o n oncompetition agreements  t he fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or a market approach 

measurement period adjustments 

we may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill if any recognized in the transaction the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined the measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits requires that we use assumptions for the valuation of projected benefit obligations pbo and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions for discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations and the expected return on plan assets due to plan changes made in 2012 and 2013 annual pay increases and the per capita cost of healthcare benefits do not materially impact plan obligations 

 discount rates — we use a highquality bond full yield curve approach specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow to establish the discount rates at each measurement date see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for the discount rates used for pbo service cost and interest cost calculations 

 expected return on plan assets — our expected return on plan assets is 1 a longterm view based on our current asset allocation and 2 a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary for the year ended december 31 2019 the expected return on plan assets was 575 70 for 2018 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the pbo and the annual net benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 



as of the december 31 2019 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets increased from 8368 million for the prior yearend to 9490 million due to strong investment returns our postretirement plans are unfunded 

the discount rate is the weightedaverage of the spot rates for each cash flow on the yield curve for highquality bonds as of the measurement date as of the december 31 2019 measurement date the pbo of our pension plans increased from 9589 million to 10909 million the pbo of our postretirement plans increased from 408 million to 412 million the pbo increases were primarily due to lower discount rates which ranged from 267 to 337 in 2019 compared with 392 to 447 in 2018 



during 2020 we expect to recognize net pension expense of 05 million and net postretirement income of 24 million compared to expense of 17 million and income of 25 million respectively in 2019 the decrease in pension expense is the result of lower discount rates on frozen plans and better than expected returns during 2019 on plan assets 

we do not anticipate that contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2020 and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

5 environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs we 

 expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy 

 expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues 

 accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost 

at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount if no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2019 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 31 million — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information about environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information about claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we file federal state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items we are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

we recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation 

generally we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years before 2016 while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate 

we consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination or the expiration of the statute of limitations upon resolution of a tax position any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

new accounting standards 

for a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption and the effect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations financial position or liquidity see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption new accounting standards 

forwardlooking statements 

the foregoing discussion and analysis as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i above

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business to manage these market risks we may use derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and risk of financial stress such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings we at times use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixedrate and floatingrate debt over time our ebitda and operating income are positively correlated to floating interest rates as measured by 3month libor as such our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates and floatingrate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results due to general economic weakness 

at december 31 2019 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was 30737 million compared to a face value of 28464 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately 3054 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

 item 9a 

controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d  15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2019 

no material changes were made during the fourth quarter of 2019 to our internal control over financial reporting nor have there been other factors that materially affect these controls 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f 

under managements supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 deloitte  touche llps report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

limitations of effectiveness of controls and procedures 

in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 



report of independent registered public accounting firm – internal control over financial reporting 

to the shareholders and board of directors of vulcan materials company 

opinion on internal control over financial reporting 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2019 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by coso 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states pcaob the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 of the company and our report dated february 26 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements 

basis for opinion 

the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the us federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 

business 

﻿ 

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  operates primarily in the us and is t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy delivered by trucks ships barges and trains our products are the indispensable materials building homes offices places of worship schools hospitals and factories as well as vital infrastructure including highways bridges roads ports and harbors water systems campuses dams airports and rail networks as of december 31 2018 we had 351 active   aggregates facilities 67 asphalt facilities and 46 concrete facilities 

business strategy 

our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our   strategy for longterm value creation is built on   1 an aggregates  focus ed   business   2 a disciplined approach to portfolio management and capital allocation   3 a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability    4 a holistic approach to land management  and  5 our commitment to safety health and the environment  

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist given o ur focus on aggregates  we 

build and hold substantial reserves  our reserves are critical to our longterm success we currently have 163 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations these restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations our downstream businesses asphalt and concrete use vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusively 

take advantage of size and scale  we are the largest aggregates supplier in the us our 351 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2018 provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally each aggregates operation is also unique because of its location within a local market and its particular geological characteristics every operation however uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement technical support and engineering 



 

2 portfolio management and capital allocation 

d emand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment during the period 20 20  20 30  moodys analytics projects that 80  of the us population growth 73  of household formation and 64  of new jobs will occur in vulcanserved states the close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in highreturn projects 

source moody’s analytics as of december 14 2018 

﻿ 

we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and by divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy our coasttocoast footprint serves 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth us metropolitan areas in 20 states plus the district of columbia 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 86 of our 2018 revenues while our top five accounted for 61 



﻿ 



 



additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton acquisitions that have c ontributed significantly to our growth we closed seven additional acquisitions in 2017 that complement our existing positions in arizona california illinois new mexico tennessee and virginia from 2015 to 2017 we invested over 12 billion in acquisitions and internal projects for longterm growth while further strengthening our portfolio through divestitures and swaps including swapping our concrete operations in arizona for asphalt operations in arizona during 2017 

while an aggregatesfocused business we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability in january 2017 we entered the asphalt market in tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business during 2018 we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses 



3 compounding improvement in profitability 

our focus on the following three major profit drivers has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton 







we manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers 



 

4  la nd management 

with approximately 240000 acres in our land portfolio a longterm holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success from premining to mining to reclamation we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land creating maximum value for the business our shareholders and our communities 

we are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development after mining our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs aquifer recharge basins public parks habitat mitigation banks wetlands productive farmland and residential and commercial developments 

because of the evolving needs of our communities we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete our work with state regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations 

5  safety health and the environment 

a strategy for sustainable longterm value creation must include doing right by your employees your neighbors and the environment in which you operate we are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another we focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives and our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate 

product lines 

our products are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals schools shopping centers factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives and the economy we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 









see note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 























 

aggregates industry 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business include 



where practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive approximately 80 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck and another 15 are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water the remaining 5 of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 





through strategic acquisitions and investments we have developed an unmatched coasttocoast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers we have over 23000 customers in 20 states the district of columbia mexico and the bahamas 







the drivers underpinning demand recovery — and sustained multiyear volume and pricing growth — remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy they include population growth gains in total employment and in household income and wages a continuing increase in household formations the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand a multiyear federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels record state tax receipts public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the longterm trendline and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure 



 

aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatelyfunded construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publiclyfunded projects particularly highways roads and bridges which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

﻿ 

source company estimates 



 

public sector construction market 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges buildings airports schools and prisons as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2018 publiclyfunded construction accounted for approximately 44 of our total aggregates shipments and approximately 23 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 





in the november 2018 general election voters in 31 states approved 79 of 352 state and local transportation funding ballot measures major transportation funding measures in vulcanserved areas are estimated to result in 30 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads streets and bridges including 2018 voters have approved 78 of nearly 1700 transportation investment ballot measures since 2009 



the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2020 in addition the bipartisan budget act of 2018 added approximately 2 billion per year to base highway programs in 2018 and 2019 

the longterm nature of the fast act is important the federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 the new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects — particularly freight projects in states where we operate we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this fast act funding and policy implementation 

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending with the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program authorized at 275 million in line with the previous program outlays and growing to 300 million by 2020 the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects 



 



in addition to these regular authorizations 893 billion in immediate federal emergency supplemental appropriations was provided for disaster recovery in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 for hurricaneaffected areas in florida louisiana texas and other states a portion of these funds will be directed to longterm and shortterm us army corps of engineerssupported flood control and other water resources construction projects as well as additional infrastructure projects that use aggregates and related materials 

private sector construction market 

the private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction in 2018 privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 56 of our total aggregates shipments 





us housing starts as measured by dodge data  analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2018 total annual housing starts in the us reached 135 million units 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad tracks we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets generati ng acceptable financial returns and enhancing financial returns in our core aggregates segment  we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete primarily in our alabama midatlantic southwestern tennessee and western markets aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 

﻿ 



 

2 asphalt 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in alabama arizona california new mexico tennessee and texas in june 2018 we strengthened our asphalt position in texas by acquiring additional asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business in march 2018 we entered the alabama asphalt market through the acquisition of an aggregates asphalt mix and construction paving business in december 2017 we strengthened our asphalt position in arizona by swapping readymixed concrete operations for an asphalt mix operation in january 2017 we entered the tennessee asphalt market through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segme nt relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement which we purchase from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities 

3 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california maryland new mexico texas virginia washington dc and the bahamas in march 2018 we exited the georgia readymixed concrete market we retained all real property which is leased to the buyer and obtained a longterm aggregates supply agreement as noted above in december 2017 we exited the arizona readymixed concrete market via a swap for an asphalt mix operation continuing our strategy to focus on asphalt mix in that market in march 2017 we reentered the california readymixed concrete market through an acquisition for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility readymixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third party producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

4 calcium 

our calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t industries with high  quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 



 

other businessrelated items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 

competitors 

we operate in a generally fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers accounted for less than onethird of the total us aggregates production in 2018 despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5800 companies managing more than 10600 operations during 2018  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 2018 our five largest customers accounted for 8 of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 2   of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publiclyfunded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publiclyfunded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 



 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration msha and occupational safety and health administration osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2019 and 2020 will be 122 million and 213 million respectively these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share in that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

for additional information about litigation and environmental matters see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments 

other information about vulcan 

vulcan is a new jersey corporation incorporated on february 14 2007 while its predecessor company was incorporated on september 27 1956 our principal sources of energy are electricity diesel fuel and natural gas we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments in 2019 

as of january 1 2019 we employed 8373 people in the united states of these employees 659 are represented by labor unions also as of that date we employed 408 people in mexico and 1 in the bahamas 332 of whom are represented by labor unions we do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2019 

we generally ship our products upon receipt of a purchase order or in some cases simply a price quote therefore we do not have a significant order backlog

risk factors 

﻿ 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

economicpolitical risks 

our business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles — our products are principally sold to the us construction industry since our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets our profits are sensitive to the underlying national regional and local economic conditions construction spending which is cyclical is affected by general economic conditions changes in interest rates demographic shifts industry cycles employment levels inflation and other business economic and financial factors that are beyond our control a downturn in construction activities or spending in vulcanserved markets particularly in our top revenuegenerating markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environment al an d other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment create restrictions on our products or impede our access to reserves or opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure — our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments in 2018 voters in local jurisdictions in california florida georgia north carolina and texas among others approved bond and revenueraising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects in 2017 three state legislatures in vulcanserved areas — california south carolina and tennessee   — passed new longterm highway funding legislation i n 2016 three states saw onetime revenue increases for transportation and numerous ballot measures were passed to increase investment in several vulcanserved areas including northern and southern california georgia north carolina and south carolina the federal fast act a five year fullyfunded road bridge and public transportation authorization law is providing assistance to state dots and metro areas however given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions   

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity   

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 



 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business   — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa we face political and other risks associated with our international operations including our largest production facility located in playa del carmen mexico these risks may include changes in international trade policies such as the north american free trade agreement imposition of duties taxes or government royalties arbitrary changes to permits zoning classifications or operating agreements or overt acts by foreign governments  including expropriations and other forms of takings of property  in addition failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrated therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments 

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 18 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 



 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact our business   — we currently have 28 billion of debt with maturities between 2019 and 2048 given our current credit metrics and ratings together with other factors we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due furthermore we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investmentgrade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit rating could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 















these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations   — labor unions represent approximately 11 of our workforce disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs andor reduced revenues resulting in lower earnings 

other risks 

a significant interruption of our information technology systems or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results — given our reliance on information technology our own and our thirdparty providers’ a significant interruption in the availability of information technology regardless of the cause could negatively impact our operations additionally the loss of confidential personal or proprietary information whether our own our employees’ our suppliers’ or our customers’ regardless of the cause could result in a business interruption reputational damage lost revenue litigation penalties or higher costs while we have and periodically test information technology and data protection policies and procedures there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches that could adversely affect our business   management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material adverse impact on our operations 



 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 

o ur products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs  truckrailcarbarge shortages and capacity constraint s additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemical s b usines s  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — as a result of recent acquisitions w e operate construction paving businesses in alabama tennessee and texas in some instances including many of our fixed price paving contracts we agree to complete a project by a certain date if we fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay consequently the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve markets in 20 states washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

﻿ 

our current estimate of 163 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects an increase of 03 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  



 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained through permit contract or grandfathered status  leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 163   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2018 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2018 and the types of facilities operated 

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

of the 163 billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 2018  90 billion tons or 55 are located on owned land and 73 billion tons or 45  are located on leased land 



 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our total revenues in 2018 



﻿ 

asphalt concrete and calcium 

as of december 31 2018 we o perate d a number of facilities producing asphalt mix readymixed concrete and calcium in several of our divisions as reflected in the table below  

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

the asphalt and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials 



 

our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  

﻿ 



﻿ 

our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products such as animal feed and plastics high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse products the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 97 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space consists of approximately 184410 square feet and is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is approximately  36 million

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels

business 

﻿ 

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  i s t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  delivered by trucks ships barges and trains our products are the indispensable materials building homes offices places of worship schools hospitals and factories as well as vital infrastructure including highways bridges road s  ports and harbors water systems campuses dams airports and rail networks as of december 31 201 7  we had 375 active   a ggregates facilities  64 asphalt facilities and 57 concrete facilities 

business strategy 

we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy we operate primarily in the us and are t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and a irports that connect us and to build the hospitals s chools shopping centers f actories and places of worship that are essential to our lives and the economy 

business strategies 

our business strategies include  1 aggregates focus  2 coasttocoast footprint  3 profitable growth  4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability  and  5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist given o ur focus on aggregates  we  

build and hold substantial reserves  o ur reserves are critical to our longterm success  they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulation s aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an d other than energy inputs required to process the materials require virtually no other raw materi al o ur downstream businesses asphalt and concrete  u se vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusively  

take advantage of size and scale  each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics every operation however uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service we are t he largest aggregates supplier in the us our 375 active   aggregates facilities as of december 31 201 7  provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement  technical support and engineering 



 

2 coasttocoast footprint 

demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly our strategic locations serve 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth us metropolitan areas in   20 states plus the district of columbia  

﻿ 

3 profitable growth 

our longterm growth is a result of strategic acquisition s a nd investments in key operations  

strategic acquisitions and dispositions  since becoming a public company in 195 7  vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions for example in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc the largest acquisition in our history this acquisition   expanded our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other southeastern and m idatlantic states  

additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton acquisitions that have c ontributed significantly to our growth   in 2017 we made a number of bolton acquisitions making attractive additions to our coasttocoast footprint in states ranging from georgia to california and up to illinois and virginia we added approximately 615 million tons of proven and probable reserves to our leading reserve base further strengthened our bestinclass aggregates   distribution network adding 16 new rail yards in our florida georgia and south carolina markets and added asphalt operations in tennessee to take further advantage of our strong aggregates position

4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability 

we focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination 







we manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers  



 

5 effective la nd management 

we own or lease well over 200000 acres of land and we manage it carefully throughout all phases of its productive use we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success as a landbased company we feel a special responsibility to the environment and the communities around us good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue t o fo cus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we own 

portfolio management 

our aggregates reserves are strategically located throughout the united states i n a reas that are projected to grow faster than the national average and that require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand vulcanserved states are estimated to generate 79  of the total growth in us population and 70  of the total growth in us household formations between 20 18 and 20 28  



﻿ 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 85  of our 2017 revenues while our top five accounted for 60  

we take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow more rapidly and by divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy in 2017 we swapped our concrete operations in arizona for strategic asphalt operations also in arizona additionally we strengthened our positions in our top ten revenue producing states via bolton acquisitions in california texas virginia tennessee georgia florida arizona south carolina and illinois 

product lines 

we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 









see note 15 segment reporting in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 





















factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our busine ss i nclude 







through strategic acquisitions and investments we have developed an unmatched coasttocoast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers we have over 20000 customers in 20 states the district of columbia mexico and the bahamas 







 



we operate an extensive logistics network along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard as shown below 

﻿ 

w here practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive   approximately 8 0  of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck and another 15  are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water  the remaining 5  of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 



 



the drivers underpinning demand recovery — and sustained multiyear volume and pricing growth — remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy they include population growth gains in total employment and in household income and wages a continuing increase in household formations the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand a multiyear federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at sta te and local le vels record stat e ta x receipts public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the longterm trendline  and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure 

aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel yf unded construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than p ublicly funded projects particularly highways roads and bridges  w hich tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

﻿

public sector   construction 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges  buildings  airports schools and prisons as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 201 7  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 46  of our total aggregates shipments    and   approximately 24  of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 





the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2020 federal spending for highways is supported by  208 billion in excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels taxes on heavy truck sales and use and heavy truck tire taxes   a nd by a 70 billion transfer of general funds to the f ederal highway trust f und 

the longterm nature of t he fast act is important t he federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years   this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 the new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects   —   particularly freight projects in states where we operate we are wellpositioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this fast act funding   and policy implementation  

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending  with the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program   authorized at 275 million  in line with the previous program outlays  and growing to 300 million by 2020  the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects  





 

private sector   construction 

the private sector   construction market s i nclude both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are   considerably more cyclical than public construction in 201 7  privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 54  of our total aggregates shipments 



nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in 201 8 based on the following assumptions 1 continuing employment growth should provide support as it has in the past 2 current backlogs that our customers  industry groups   and outside economists are reporting should continue to be a source of deman d  a nd 3 with a stable tax base local governments should use funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 



us housing starts as measured by dodge data  analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 201 7  total annual housing starts in the us reached almost 13 million units  housing starts were particularly robust in our markets which grew at almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole  the consistent growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad track s  we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15  segment reporting    in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets generati ng acceptable financial returns and enhancing financial returns in our core aggregates segment  we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete primarily in our midatlantic georgia southwestern  tennessee and western markets aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 



 

2  asphalt 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california new mexico  tennessee   and texas  in december 2017 we strengthened our asphalt position in arizona by swapping readymixed concrete operations for an asphalt mix operation in january 2017  we entered the tennessee market through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt   segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement  which we purchas e fr om thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt segment customers either directly f rom our local production facilities or through our distribution yards  

3  concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete i n c alifornia georgia maryland new mexico texas virginia washington dc and the bahamas in may 2015 we entered the arizona readymixed concrete market through the acquisition of readymixed concrete operations in conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in arizona and new mexico as noted above in december 2017 we exited the arizona readymixed concrete market via a swap for an asphalt mix operation continuing our strategy to focus on asphalt mix in that market in january 2015 we swapped our readymixed concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations primarily in arizona  in march 2017 we reentered the california readymixed concrete market through an acquisition for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility ready mixed concrete production also requires cement which w e purchase from third party producers  we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

4 calcium 

our calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t i ndustries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

other business  related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart er fu rthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions  demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 



 

competitors 

we operate in a generally fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers account ed for less than onethird of to tal us aggregates production   in 201 7  despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than   10  o ther publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5700 companies managing   more than 10000   operations during 201 7  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 201 7  ou r f ive largest customers accounted for 73  of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 24    of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45  to 55    of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and saf ety   examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration  msha  and occupational safety and health administration  osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201 8 and 201 9 will b e  149   million and  294 million respectively  these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share in that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

for additional information about litigation and environmental matters see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments 

other information about vulcan 

vulcan is a new jersey corporation incorporated on february 14 2007 while its predecessor company was incorporated on september 27 1956 our principal sources of energ y are electricity diesel fuel and natural ga s  w e do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments in 201 8  

as of january 1 201 8  we employed 7900   people in the u nited s tates  of these employees 643   are represented by labor unions also a s of that dat e we   employ ed   386 people in mexic o a nd 1 in the bahamas  310 of whom are represented by labor union s  we do not   anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 201 8    

we generally ship our products upon receipt of a purchase order or in some cases simply a price quote therefore we do not have a significant order backlog

 item 1a   

risk factors 

﻿ 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations    and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

ec onomicpolitical risks 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environment al an d other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use   and   environmenta l m atters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capit al an d operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities  taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment create restrictions on our products or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies — the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted on december 22  2017 as explained in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we have included provisional adjustments in the financial statements for certain projected impacts of the legislation and no adjustments for certain other aspects our accounting for these items could be adjusted during the measurement period which could be as late as december 2018 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure   —   our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments in 2017 three state legislatures in vulcanserved areas — california tennessee and south carolina   — passed new longterm highway funding legislation   i n 2016 three state s saw onetime revenue increases for transportation and numerous b allot measures wer e p assed to increase investmen t i n several vulcanserved areas including northern and southern california georgia north carolina and south carolina  the federal fast act a five year fullyfunded road bridge and public transportation authorization law is providing assistance to state dots and metro areas however  given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions   

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity   

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate chang e l egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 



 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business   — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa w e face political and other risks associated with our international operations  including our largest production facility located in playa del carmen mexico these risks may include changes in international trade policies such as the north american free trade agreement imposition of duties taxes or government royaltie s  arbitrary changes to permits zoning classification s or operating agreements  or overt acts by foreign governments   in addition f ailure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs   — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrate d therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volum es in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry si tes often take years to develop  therefore  our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions including aggregates usa acquired in december 2017 we are able to complete our future results w ill depend i n part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profit s a re   negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments  

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill   —   we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 1 7 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 



 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact our business   —   we currently have  29   billion of debt with maturities between 20 18 and 2 0 47  given our current credit metrics and ratings together with other factors we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due furthermore  we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situational dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investment  grade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit rating could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in critical accounting policies under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use significant judgment in accounting for  















these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations   —   labor unions represent approximately 11  of our workforce disputes with our trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreement s  m ay lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs andor reduced revenues resulting in lower earnings 

other risks 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks — any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of our systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage  which could adversely affect our results of operations as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weathe r   



 

o ur products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the c osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs  truckrailcarbarge shortages and capacity constraint s additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemical s b usines s  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12  commitments and contingencies    in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

our construction   paving business   may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — as a result of a 2017 acquisition w e operate a construction   paving business in tennessee in some instances including many of our fixed price paving contracts we agree to complete a project by a certain date if we fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay    consequently  the total project cost could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profit s or even a loss on the project  

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty   —   we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve mark ets in 20 sta tes washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

﻿ 

our current estimate of 160   billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects a n   in crease of 0 5 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations  such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  



 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 160   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 201 7   i nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division  the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 201 7 and the types of facilities operated

executive summary 

financial summary for 201 7 compared to 201 6  





























































﻿ 

2017 results were negatively impacted by unusually harsh weather severe flooding in california during the fi rst quarter extreme rainfall in core southeastern markets alabama florida georgia louisiana and mississippi during the second quar ter and hurricanes  harvey and irma tropical storm  nate  conditions across our florida georgia gulf coast north carolina south carolina and coastal texas markets during the third quarter  and their lingering effects on costs into the fourth quarter 



 

we closed the acquisition of aggregates usa on december 29 2017 for 616 million net of 287 million immediately disposed   and including 6 million of liabilities assumed   this transaction complements and expands our service offerings in georgia south carolina and florida with 3 granite quarries and 16 rail distribution yards the integration is proceeding as planned  a lthough full synergy capture will require at least 18 to 24 months we still expect this acquisition to be accretive to 2018 e arnings 50 million of ebitda 

for the full year capital expenditures were 4 642 million this amount included  2965 million of core operating and maintenance capital investments to improve or replace existing property plant  equipment in line with expectations in addition we invested 1677 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves develo p n ew production sites enhance our distribution capabilities and support the targeted growth of our asphalt and concrete operations 

at the end of the fourth quarter total debt was 28549 million and cas h a nd cash equivalents was  1416 million in 2017  we early retired  10874 million of notes due in 2021 and 2018 for 12282 million onetime interest charges related to these early debt retirements were  1480 million i n   december we also entered into a 6month 3500 million term loan that we refinanced on a longterm basis in february 2018  

our record safety performance in 2017 reinforces our confidence that our core operating disciplines remain strong 

2017 acquisitions 

we continue to pursue opportunities for valuecreating acquisitions swaps and greenfield investments we completed a number of important bolton acquisitions making attractive additions to our coasttocoast footprint in states ranging from georgia to california and up to illinois and virginia  of particular note was the acquisition of aggregates usa which added approximately 460 million tons of proven and probable reserves to our leading reserve base and further strengthened our bestinclass distribution network adding 16 new rail distribution yards in our florida georgia and south carolina markets 

we will continue to make disciplined investments in organic and acquisitionled growth while continuing to emphasize capital returns and cost control we are completely focused on actions that improve returns to our shareholders we seek continuous compounding improvement generating big results through small actions our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged 









for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

estimated impact of tax reform 

whil e t he full impact of the tcja   continues to be assessed  we expect our earnings and cash flows will benefit meaningfully going forward  on a net basis and leaving all other factors unchanged  o ur total effective tax rate should decline from approximately 28 to 20 

we continue to evaluate other aspect s of the tcja including immediate deductibility of certain qualified capital spending w e expect core capital spending  necessary to support an increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies  of approximately 250 million we also plan for over  3 50 million in internal growth capital expenditures during 2018 including the development of strategic quarry sites in california and texas   at this time we do not know how much of this 600 million of capital spending will qualify for immediate deductibility  



 

market developments and outlook 

we expect strong earnings growth in 2018   leading indicators such as the preconstruction pipeline and construction starts in our markets as well as our own order backlogs point towar d g rowth private demand continues to grow and public demand is strengthening after relative weakness in 2016 and part of 2017 these positive trends provide greater visibility into demand and indicate the continuation of a favorabl e p ricing environment recent acquisitions are performing well and should make meaningful contributions to our earnings growth in 2018 and beyon d  

private demand in vulcanserved markets continues to recover and public demand appears to be firming up after a disappointing 2017 the pricing climate for our materials remains positive supported by solid demand visibility rising diesel prices rising cement prices and expanding contractor margins for 2018 we expect samestore aggregates shipment growth of 4 to 6 and aggregates pricing growth of 3 to 5 albeit with significant variability across individual markets 

we also expect our margin performance to return to its longerterm trend of continuous compounding improvement s  w eatherrelated cost pressures faced in 2017 are not anticipated and rising diesel and distribution costs should flowthrough to pricing although with a lag tax reform and the acquisition of aggregates usa will also support growth in earnings and in cash flow 

management expectations for 2018 include 























the ultimate level and quarterly timing of shipments in 2018 will depend in part on the pace of starts and construction activity for larger publiclyfunded projects however we have better visibility than we did one year ago we expect pricing to improve throughout the year partly in response to rising diesel costs and other inflationary trends with a return to approximately 5 samestore shipment growth we anticipate a return to the incremental flowthrough rates achieved earlier in the recovery cycle 



 

competitive advantag es 

z oning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries such regulations while curtailing expansion also increase the value of our reserve s t he competitive advantages of our aggregates focused business strategy include

term debt 

all of our 26315 million of term debt is unsecured  20313 million of such deb t i s governed by tw o e ssentially identica l i ndentures that contain customary investmentgrade type covenants the primary covenant in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt    6000 million of such debt is governed as described below largely by the same credit agreement that governs our line of credit   a s of december 31  201 7  we were in compliance with all term debt covenants 

in december 2017 we early retired via tender offer 5649 million of the 750 notes due 2021 at a cost of 6626 million including a premium of 962 million and transaction costs of 16 million additionally we recognized net noncash expense of 42 million with the acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs subsequently in january 2018 we early retired via redemption the remaining 351 million of the 750 notes due 2021 at a cost of 407 million including a premium of 56 millio n 



 

also in december 2017 we entered into a 6month 3500 million unsecured term loan with one of the banks that provides our line of credi t b orrowings bear interest at libor plus 125 and may be prepaid any time without penalty this term loan incorporates by reference the representation s  covenants and events of default contained in the credit agreement for the line of credit as such it is subject to the same affirmative negative and financial covenants 

the december 2017 early debt retirement and acquisition of aggregates usa were funded by a combination of cash on hand our line of credit and the new 6month unsecured term loan 

in june 2017 we issued 1000 0 million of debt composed of three issuances as follows 1 700 0 million   of 450 senior notes due june 20 47 2 50 0 million   of   390 senior notes due april 2027 these notes are a further issuance of  and form a single series with the 390 notes issued in march 2017 and 3 250 0 million   of floatingrate senior notes due june 20 20 these issuances resulted in proceeds of  989 5 million net of original issue discounts premiums  underwriter fees and other transaction costs the proceeds were used to partially finance an acquisition and to early retire the notes due in 2018  272 5 million  700 and 250 0 million  10375  this early retirement was completed in july at a cost of  565  6 million    including a  43 0 million premium  and 3 0 million o f n oncash expense associated with the acceleration of unamortized discounts deferred debt issuance costs and deferred interest rat e derivative settlement losses

in june 2017 we drew the full 2500 million on the unsecured delayed draw term loan entered into in december 2016  these funds were used to repay the 2350 million borrowed on our line of credit and for general corporate purposes   borr owings bear interest in the sa me manner as the line of credit the term loan principal will be repaid quarterly beginning march 2018 as follows quarter s 5 – 8  16 millionquarter 9 – 12  31 millionquarter 13 – 19  47 millionquarter and 1984 million for quarter 20 december 202 1  the term loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty  it is provided by the same group of banks that provides our line of credit and is governed by the same credit agreement as the line of credit a s such it is subject to the same affirmative negative and financial covenants 

in march 2017 we issued 3500 million of 390 senior notes due april 2027 for proceeds of 3455 million net of original issue discounts underwriter fees and other transaction costs the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes this series of notes now totals 4000 million due to the additional 500 million of notes issued in june as described above

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the followin g c ritical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 















1 goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 201 7  goodwill represents 33  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 17 reporting units    of which 9 carry goodwill    based primarily on geographic location  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill i f the fair value exceeds its carrying value the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  however if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni ts   using bo th an income approach  which involves discounting estimated future cash flows  and a market approach    which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies   w e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models  finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 



 

our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control o r u nderperformance relative to historical or projecte d o perating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and if applicable acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 201 7  net p roperty plant  equipment represents 41  of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 11  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates  assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impai rment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg    a sphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates impacts the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2017 we recorded no   loss on impairment of longlived assets    during 2016 we recorded a 105 million impairment loss   resulting from the termination of a nonstrategic aggregates lease and the write off of nonrecoverable project costs related to two aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete  during 2015 we recorded a  52 millio n i mpairment loss   resulting from exiting a lease   for an aggregates segment site  



 

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being use d in our operations these assets totaled  4 157 million at december 31 201 7  representing a n   1 1    in crease from december 31 201 6  of the total    41 57 million  approximately 50  relates to re al estate held for future development and expansion of o ur op erations in addition  approximately   2 5  is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 25  is composed of aggregates a sphalt and concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products we anticipate moving   idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information about longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 property plant  equipment and note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

3 business combinations and purchase price allocation 

our strategic longterm plan s includ e potential investments in valueadded acquisitions of related or similar businesse s  w hen an acquisition is completed our consolidated statement s of comprehensive income includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition which is the date that control is obtained 

how we determine and allocate the purchase price 

the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred   to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because t he estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions  additionally the amounts assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill which is not amortized can significantly affect our results of operations  

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price a fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants the fair value hierarchy prioriti z es the   inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below  

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

level   1   fair values are used to value investments in publiclytraded entities and assumed obligations for publiclytraded longterm debt 

level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquire d m achinery and equipment land buildings and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations environmental remediation and compliance obligation s a dditionally level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at otherthanmarket rates 

level 3   fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests  referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place and other identifiable intangible assets we determine t he fair values of owned mineral reserves and leased mineral interests using a lost profits approach and or an excess earnings approach  these valuation techniques require management to estimate future cash flows the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management but is inherently uncertain key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price shipment volumes production costs and capital needs the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows 



 

other identifiable intangible assets may include but are not limited t o n oncompetition agreements and favorable unfavorable lease agreement s  t he fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method a replacement cost method or a market approach 

measurement period adjustments 

we may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date any such adjustments are the result of subsequently   obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the l iabilities assumed measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill  if any recognized in the transaction the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined the measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions about the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review the following primary assumption s 









how we set our assumptions 

the effective d iscount rate is the weightedaverage of the spot rates for each cash flow on the yield curve for highquality bonds as of the measurement date a t december 31 201 7  the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 324  to 379  december 31 201 6 ranged from 3 4 3  to 4 41  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future return expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 201 7  the expected return on plan assets remained at 700 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligation s a nd the annual ne t b enefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

﻿ 



﻿ 



 

as of the december 31 201 7 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets in c rease d f rom  74 95 million for the prior yearend to  8409   million du e t o   investment gains and 106 million of contributio ns to the qualified pension plan s 

we use a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure service and interest costs for 2017 were 463  and 363  respectively for our pension plans and 396  and 289  respectively for our other postretirement plans the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure service and interest costs for 2016 were 468 and 379 respectively for our pension plans and 377 and 281 respectively for our other postretirement plans 

during 201 8  we expect to recognize   n et pensio n credit o f  55 million and net postretirement credit o f  3 1  million compared to expense of  32 million and credit of  34   million respectively in 201 7  the reductions in cost recognition   are primarily due to strong asset returns during 2017 and anticipated discretionary contribution s to the pension plans 

we do not anticipate contributions to the funded pension pla ns will be required during 201 8  however   we do an ticipate makin g d iscretionary contribution s of 1000 million we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 benefit plans in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

5 environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs   our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs  we 







at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur  but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study  when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount if no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 201 7  the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was  31 millio n — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts h owever   a number of factors including adverse agency rulings an d u nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information about environmental compliance costs see note 8 accrued environmental remediation costs in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program  we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to  20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to  30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information about claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance  

7 income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we fil e f ederal state and foreign income tax returns   and a ccount for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met hod we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities  which reflect our best assessment of th e f uture taxes we will pay  based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities  deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns   while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items   we are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted refer to note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for a discussion of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

l iability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

we recognize a ta x benefit associated with a t ax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position  for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold w e m easure th e income t ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realiz ed a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position ou r liability for u nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments a nd new or emerging legislation 

the   years open   to   tax examinations vary by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is appropriate  

we consider a   tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination    or the expiration of the statute of limitati ons upon resolution of a tax position an y liability for u nrecognized tax benefits will be released 

ou r liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our   liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits as income tax expense 

new accounting standards 

for a discussion of accounting standards recently adopte d or pending adoption and the e ffect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations financial position or liquidity see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  under the caption new accounting standards 

forwardlooking statements 

the foregoing discussion and analysis as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report contain  forwardlooking statements  within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i above

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business to manage these market risks we may use derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and r isk of financial stress  such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings we at times use i nterest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed rate and floatingrate debt 

while floatingrate debt exposes us to rising interest rates it is typically cheaper than issuing fixedrate debt at any point in time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixedrate debt however a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results over time our ebitda and o perating income are positively correlated to floating interest rates as measured by 3month libor as such our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates and floatingrate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results due to general economic weakness  

at december 31 201 7  the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was  30248   million compared to a book value of  2 8549 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately  2369 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit s costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

business 

﻿ 

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  i s t he nation’s largest supplier   of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  as of december 31 2016 we had 337 active a ggregates facilities  

vulcan’s value proposition 

we ar e th e largest supplier   of construction aggregates in the country with coasttocoast aggregates operations our leading position is based upon 







﻿ 

these factors together with our strong operating expertise and price discipline allow ed us to deliver a 14 increase 481 compared to 424 in aggregates segment unit gross profit per ton in 2016 

portfolio management 

our aggregates reserves are strategically located throughout the united states i n a reas that are projected to grow faster than the national average and that require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand vulcanserved states are estimated to generate 79  of the total growth in us population and 71  of the total growth in us household formations between 2015 and 2025  



﻿ 

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 84  of our 2016 revenues while our top five accounted for 59  

﻿ 



 

we take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow more rapidly and by divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our longterm growth strategy in 201 6 we expanded our aggregates distribution capabilities in georgia and completed two strategic bolton acquisitions in new mexico and texas 

w here practical we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive   approximately 80  of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck and another 16  are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water  the remaining 4  of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water 

business strategy and competitive advantage 

we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy we operate primarily in the us and are t he nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and a irports that connect us and to build the hospitals s chools shopping centers f actories and places of worship that are essential to our lives and the economy 

business strategies 

our business strategies include  1 aggregates focus  2 coasttocoast footprint  3 profitable growth  4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability  and  5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist given o ur focus on aggregates  we  

build and hold substantial reserves  o ur reserves are critical to our longterm success  they are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand moreover there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulation s aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an d other than energy inputs required to process the materials require virtually no other raw materi al o ur downstream businesses asphalt mix and concrete  u se vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusively  

take advantage of size and scale  each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics every operation however uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service we are t he largest aggregates supplier in the us our 337 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 201 6  provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement  technical support and engineering 



 

2 coasttocoast footprint 

demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly our strategic locations serve 19 of the top 25 highestgrowth us metropolitan areas in   20 states plus the district of columbia  

﻿ 

﻿ 

3 profitable growth 

our longterm growth is a result of strategic acquisition s a nd investments in key operations  

strategic acquisitions and dispositions  since becoming a public company in 1956 vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions for example in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc the largest acquisition in our history this acquisition   expanded our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other southeastern and m idatlantic states  in 2014 we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates busin ess in arizona california new   mexico texas virginia and washington d c and our asphalt mix business in arizona and new mexic o  in 2015 we completed an asset exchange transaction in which we exited our readymixed concrete business in california and further expanded our asphalt mix business in arizona 

additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton acquisitions that have c ontributed significantly to our growth   for example in 201 6 we completed strategic bolton acquisitions in new mexico and texas

4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability 

we focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination 







we manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers 

﻿ 

﻿ 

a ggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past few years and we expect continuing improvement in unit profitability 







5 effective la nd management 

we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue t o fo cus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we own 



 

competitive advantages

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 





















 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our busine ss i nclude 



we operate an extensive logistics network along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard as shown below

source company estimates 

﻿ 









aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel yf unded construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than p ublicly funded projects particularly highways roads and bridges  w hich tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 



 

public sector   construction 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges  buildings  airports schools and prisons as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2016  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 47  of our total aggregates shipments    and   approximately 26  of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 





the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2020 federal spending for highways is supported by  208 billion in excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels taxes on heavy truck sales and use and heavy truck tire taxes   a nd by a 70 billion transfer of general funds to the f ederal highway trust f und 

the longterm nature of t he fast act  which authorizes federal funding through ffy 2020  is important t he federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years   this multiyear authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longrange complex highway projects 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 the new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects   —   particularly freight projects in states where we operate we are wellpositioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this fast act funding   and policy implementation  

project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending  with the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program   authorized at 275 million  in line with the previous program outlays  and growing to 300 million by 2020  the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements for transportation projects  





 

private sector   construction 

the private sector   construction market s i nclude both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are   considerably more cyclical than public construction in 201 6  privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 53  of our total aggregates shipments 



nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in 2017 based on the following assumptions 1 continuing employment growth should provide support as it has in the past 2 current backlogs that our customers  industry groups   and outside economists are reporting should continue to be a source of demand in 2017  a nd 3 growing state and local tax revenues should provide local governments with the funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 



us housing starts as measured by dodge analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2016 total annual housing starts in the us increased to 1 18 million an increase of 22 over 2015 housing growth was particularly robust in our markets which grew at almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole  the consistent growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad track s  we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15  segment reporting    in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

vertical integration 

while aggregates is our focus and primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and readymixed concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns we produce and sell asphalt mix andor readymixed concrete primarily in our midatlantic georgia southwestern and western markets aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 80 of readymixed concrete by weight in both of these downstream businesses aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations 



 

2  asphalt mix 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california new mexico and texas  this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt m ix segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement  which we purchas e fr om thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt m ix segment customers from our local production facilities 

3  concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in arizona georgia maryland new mexico texas virginia washington dc and the bahamas in may 2015 we entered the arizona readymixed concrete market through the acquisition of readymixed concrete operations in conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in arizona and new mexico in january 2015 we swapped our readymixed concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations primarily in arizona in march 2014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

ready mixed concrete production also requires cement which w e purchase from third party producers  we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

4 calcium 

a s n oted above  i n march 2 014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in th e florida area for additional details see note 19 “ acquisitions and divestitures ” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we retained our former cement segment’s calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal fee d pl astics and water treatmen t i ndustries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

other business  related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart er fu rthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions  demographic and population fluctuations and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector 



 

competitors 

we operate in a generally fragmented industr y w ith a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers account ed for approximately   30  to 35    of to tal us aggregates production   in 201 6  despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than   10  o ther publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 6000 companies managing   more than 11000 operations during 201 6  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 201 6  ou r f ive largest customers accounted for 8 1  of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 30    of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45  to 55    of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and saf ety   examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration  msha  and occupational safety and health administration  osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201 7 and 201 8 will be approximately  17   million and  11 million respectively  these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

we have received notices from the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at a limited number of sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund or similar state and local environmental laws generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other prps or alleged prps in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations there is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual partys share in that cost as a result estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination remediation methods other prps and their probable level of involvement and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

for additional information about litigation and environmental matters see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information about reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments

 item 1a   

risk factors 

﻿ 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations    and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

ec onomicpolitical risks 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental  international trade and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use  environmental  and international trade matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capit al an d operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities  taxes or tariffs on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure   —   our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments although   congre ss p assed and president obama signed a fiveyear fully  funded bill into law to invest in roads bridges and public transportation   in 2015 and   in 2016 three state legislatures in vulcan served areas passed onetime revenue increases for transportation and b allot measures were also passed to increase investment transportation infrastructure in several vulcanserved areas including northern and southern california georgia north carolina and sout h carolina  given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions   

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity   

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate chang e l egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business   — we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa w e face political and other risks associated with our international operations  including our largest production facility located in playa del carmen mexico these risks may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royaltie s or overt acts by foreign governments   in addition f ailure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us 



 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs   — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrate d therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volum es in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt mix are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt mix could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry si tes often take years to develop  therefore  our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results w ill depend i n part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profit s a re   negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments  

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill   —   we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 1 6 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 



 

a deterioration in our credit ratings andor the state of the capital markets could negatively impact our business   —   we currently have 2 billion of debt with maturities between 2018 and 2037 given our current credit metrics and ratings together with other factors we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due furthermore  we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations additional debt andor additional equity the mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situational dependent 

a deterioration in our credit ratings regardless of the cause could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions while we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade and plan to manage the capital structure consistent with investment  grade credit metrics we cannot assure our current credit ratings 

a deterioration in the state of the capital markets regardless of our credit rating could impact our access to and cost of new debt or equity capital 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in critical accounting policies under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use significant judgment in accounting for  













these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

other risks 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks — any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of our systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage  which could adversely affect our results of operations as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 



 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the c osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemical s b usines s  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12  commitments and contingencies    in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty   —   we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

aggregates 

a s t he largest us supplier of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve mark ets in 20 sta tes washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

﻿ 

﻿ 

our current estimate of 155 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects a   de crease of 02 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations  such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  



 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 155   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 201 6   i nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division  the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 201 6 and the types of facilities operated 

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

of the 155   billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 201 6  87   billion tons or 56  are located on owned land and 68 billion tons or 44  are located on leased land 



 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our total revenues in 201 6

﻿ 

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  

﻿ 



﻿ 

our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products  such as animal feed and plastic s h igh purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse produc ts the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 98

our commitments 

we crush rocks for a living but at its core this is a relationship business we are deeply committed to our customers and our people and deeply embedded in our communities 

our commitment to customers — we have the capabilities to fulfill our customers’ needs on large complex jobs with unmatched performance and service and we aim to be the supplier of choice for smaller contractors with all of our customers we strive to maintain and improve our relationships to provide outstanding value and service for a fair price by being a solution provider rather than simply an aggregates provider 

our commitment to our employees — we work hard to ensure our employees’ safety and health in a positive environment where each person can thrive we are completely focused on the things that we can control and it is here that our people continue to make all the difference increasing unit profitability delivering incremental earnings and improving our worldclass aggregates franchise every day 

our commitment to our communities — our people contribute to the cities towns and neighborhoods where they live and work in big ways and in small from disaster relief to the support of education and a wide variety of other social causes and programs at vulcan this means a great deal more than just financial support our people throughout the united states and in mexico are generously volunteering their time talent and energy to improve the world around them 

our commitment to the environment — we take a longterm approach that bears in mind the demands of the present and the needs of the future as we continue to build on our legacy we do so with a clear view of our responsibility to future generations 

our commitment to our shareholders — we work hard every day to generate returns that exceed market averages we are good stewards with responsible operating and capital project expenditures to achieve a healthy return on our shareholders’ investment in us we will continue to strive to be the market leader winning on margin performance consistent strength of execution and pricing performance earning a superior return on the very significant capital invested in our business 

we believe our ability to succeed stems directly from these commitments over the years nearly six decades we have built a strong resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way we expect this to continue for the decades to come 

201 6   acquisitions 

during 2016 we acquired the assets of the following businesses   for total consideration of 333 million  







for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

market developments and outlook 

the strong fundamentals of our aggregatesfocused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth during the last three years of recovery in 2017 we expect continued growth across the vast majority of our markets and across each of the end use segments we serve our expectation for full year adjusted ebitda of 1125 to 1225 billion is driven by a continuing recovery in shipments with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand as well as a favorable pricing environment 

the following assumptions support our outlook for strong yearoveryear growth in adjusted ebitda in 2017 









other expectations include 









we remain focused on continuous  compounding improvement in profitability and cash flows    our 2017 outlook reflects earnings growth and unit margin performance consistent with recent trends as well as our longer range goals the flowthrough of freightadjusted revenues to gross profit in our aggregates segment should remain in line with the longterm goal of greater than 60 since the beginning of this recovery o ur eff orts have resulted in aggregates segment gross profit increasing 515 million on a 41 million ton increase in shipments during this   same period uni t g ross profit in our core aggregates segment has improved 89 on a trailing twelve month ttm basis

asphalt mix segment gross profit increased 25 to 977 million volumes and price decreased 3 and 2 respectively versus the prior year while gross profit margin expanded 43 percentage points 430 basis points due mostly to lower unit costs for liquid asphalt the significant increase in asphalt mix shipments from 2014 to 2015 was largely attributable to the january 2015 swap of our concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations primarily in arizona 



3  concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 







concrete segment gross profit increased 32 and gross profit margin expanded 13 percentage points 130 basis points versus the prior year readymixed concrete shipments increased 7 and the average sales price increased 3 material margins expanded offsetting higher costs for internally supplied aggregates and other raw materials the significant decrease in readymixed concrete shipments from 2014 to 2015 was largely attributable to the aforementioned january 2015 swap of our concrete operations in california

income taxes 

our income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the 300 million increase in our 2016 income tax expense is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our earnings from continuing operations partially offset by a 248 million excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation resulting from our early adoption of asu 201609   see note 1 “significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   under the caption s harebased compensatio n   the 2016 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction related to higher aggregates sales and the early adoption of asu 201609   

the 33 million increase in our 2015 incom e t ax   e xpense is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our earnings from continuing operations  the 2015 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction and the us production deduction both related to higher aggregates sales a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 201 6  201 5 and 20 14 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial committed bank line of credit additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of no ns trategic operating assets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund ou r b usiness requirements for 201 7  including 













our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged from the prior year we intend to take a balanced approach to capital deployment one incorporating strategic reinvestment sustained financial strength and flexibility and the return of capital to shareholders in 2016 and 2015 we returned  1063 and 532 million  respectively in cash to shareholders through our dividend and  1615 million and 215 million  respectively through share repurchases we expect to increase the return of capital through dividends  share repurchases  or other mechanisms as earnings grow 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following six critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 













1 goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 201 6  goodwill represents 37  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 18 reporting units of which 9 carry goodwill we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a twostep quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  





step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair valu e representing implied goodwill 





 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni ts   using bo th an income approach  which involves discounting estimated future cash flows  and a market approach    which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies   w e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models  finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 

our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control o r u nderperformance relative to historical or projecte d o perating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 201 6  net p roperty plant  equipment represents 39  of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 9  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates  assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 



 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impai rment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg    a sphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates impacts the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2016 we recorded a 105 million loss on impairment of longlived assets resulting from the termination of a nonstrategic aggregates lease and the write off of nonrecoverable project costs related to two aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete  during 2015 we recorded a  52 millio n i mpairment loss   resulting from exiting a lease   during 201 4  we recorded a  31 million impairment loss related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area see note 19 acquisitions and divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being use d in our operations these assets totaled  3744   million at december 31 201 6  representing a less than 10    in crease from december 31 201 5  of the total    3744 million  approximately 40  relates to re al estate held for future development and expansion of o ur op erations in addition  approximately   25  is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 35  is composed of aggregates a sphalt mix and r eadymix ed concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products we anticipate moving   idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information about longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 property plant  equipment and note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

3  pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions about the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review the following primary assumption s 









how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we use   the yield on highquality bonds with a duration equal to the duration of plan liabilitie s a t december 31 201 6  the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 343  to 441  december 31 201 5 ranged from 353  to 468  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 201 6  the expected return on plan assets was reduced to 700 december 31 2015 was 750  



 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligation s a nd the annual ne t b enefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

﻿ 



﻿ 

as of the december 31 201 6 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets in c rease d f rom  7457 million to  7495   million du e t o investment returns  no   contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 201 6  

during 201 7  we expect to recognize net pensio n expense o f approximately  04 million and net postretirement credit of approximately   37  million compared to credits of   36  million and   37  million respectively in 201 6  the in crease s   are primarily due to a reduction in discount rates coupled with the aforementioned reduction in the expected longterm return on pension assets 

i n 2016 we chang ed   our method to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans previously  we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period as of 2016  we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cos t a pplying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows   we ma de this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates  

we account ed for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly account ed for it prospectively as of 2016 the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure servic e a nd interest cos ts for 2016 were   468  and 379  respectively for our pension plans and 377  and 281  respectively for our other postretirement plans 

we do not anticipate contributions to the funded pension pla ns will be required during 201 7  however we do anticipate making a discretionary contribution   of 95 million  we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 benefit plans in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

4  environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs   our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs  we 







at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur  but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study  when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount if no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 201 6  the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was  33 millio n — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts h owever   a number of factors including adverse agency rulings an d u nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information about environmental compliance costs see note 8 accrued environmental remediation costs in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

5  claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program  we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to  20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to  30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information about claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance  



 

6  income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we fil e f ederal state and foreign income tax returns   and a ccount for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met hod we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities  which reflect our best assessment of th e f uture taxes we will pay  based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities  deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns   while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

at december 31 201 6  we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of  545 million against which we have a valuation allowance of  442 million of the deferred tax assets  532 million relates to alabama 

from 2008 through the second quarter of 2015 we carried a full valuation allowance against the alabama deferred tax asset for the following reasons 





during the second quarter of 2015 we restructured our legal entities among other benefits we anticipated that the restructuring would generate significant taxable income in alabama and therefore allow for the utilization of some or all of the alabama deferred tax asset 

our alabama cumulative loss is calculated as pretax earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations and other comprehensive income plus permanent differences over the last three years while evaluating all available positive and negative evidence realizing the significance of the restructuring in our alabama income tax filing we determined that it was appropriate to adjust our alabama cumulative loss calculation to consider the restructuring remove pretax earnings from discontinued operations and other comprehensive income and remove any other significant nonrecurring items we refer to this calculation as our alabama adjusted earnings 

at the end of the second quarter of 2015  our alabama adjusted earnings were negative however the alabama adjusted earnings loss was dramatically smaller t han our alabama cumulative loss o f the three adjustments made the restructuring had the greatest impact   in addition we considered all other forms of positive and negative evidence including the four sources of taxable income the first three sources of taxable income carryback potential reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies provided very little positive evidence because our alabama adjusted earnings were a loss we did not project future alabama taxable income the fourth source as a result during the second quarter of 2015 we continued to carry a full valuation allowance against our alabama deferred tax asset 

at the end of the third quarter of 2015  our alabama adjusted earnings turned positive this development provided sufficient positive evidence such that we determined it was appropriate to use projections of future alabama taxable income in our assessment for the first time however because we had not yet returned to sustained profitability ie an alabama cumulative gain  we used our alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings as the basis for an objectively verifiable projection of future alabama taxable income this projection in addition to considering all other positive and negative evidence led us to conclude in the thir d qu art er th at it was more likely than not that  47 million of the deferred tax asset was realizable therefore we recognized a deferred tax benefi t of 47 millio n i n the third quarter   of 2015 by reducing the valuation allowance  ou r a nalysis in each of the four subsequent quarters further confirmed our third quarter of 2015 conclusio n b ut resulted in no further reductions of the valuation allowance  



 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we achieved three consecutive years of positive alabama adjusted earnings this development together with the projection of future alabama taxable income using our most recent trailing twelve months adjusted earnings warranted an additional partial releas e of 48 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as of yearend 2016 we have recognized 95 million of the alabama deferred tax asset 

we believe that once we have an alabama cumulative gain we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that we have returned to sustained profitability and we will no longer limit our estimate of future taxable income to our alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings at that time we may realize a significant portion if not all of the alabama deferred tax asset we project the earliest this could happen would be the fourth quarter of 2017 

l iability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

we recognize a ta x benefit associated with a t ax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position  for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold w e m easure th e income t ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realiz ed a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position ou r liability for u nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments a nd new or emerging legislation 

the   years open   to   tax examinations vary by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is appropriate  

we consider a   tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination    or the expiration of the statute of limitati ons upon resolution of a tax position an y liability for u nrecognized tax benefits will be released 

ou r liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our   liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits as income tax expense

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

﻿ 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business to manage these market risks we may use derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and r isk of financial stress  such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings under our line of credit we at times use i nterest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed rate and floatingrate debt 

while floatingrate debt exposes us to rising interest rates it is typically cheaper than issuing fixedrate debt at any point in time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixedrate debt however a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results since 2002 our ebitda and operating income are positively correlated to floating interest rates as measured by 3month libor as such our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates and floatingrate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results due to general economic weakness  

at december 31 201 6  the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was  22434 million compared to a book value of  19829 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately  1049 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d    1 5e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 201 6  based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2016  

no   material changes were made d uring the fourth quarter of 201 6 to our internal controls over financial reporting  nor have there been o ther factors that materially affect these controls 

management s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f 

under managements supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 201 6  

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 201 6  deloitte  touche llps report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

limitations of effectiveness of controls and procedures 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

 item 1 

business 

  

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  is the nation’s largest produ cer of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  as of december 31 2015 we had 344 active a ggregates facilities  

vulcan’s value proposition 

we are t he largest producer of construction aggregates in the country with coasttocoast aggregates operations our leading position is based upon 







  

these factors together with our strong operating expertise and price discipline allow us to deliver the highest margins per ton shipped in the industry 

portfolio management 





  

our top ten revenue producing states accounted for 83  of our 2015 revenues while our top five accounted for 59  

  



 





competitors 

we operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers account ed for approximately   30  to 35  of to tal us aggregates production   in 201 5  despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than   10  o ther publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5900 companies managing   almost 11000 operations during 201 5  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or by extending   their existing market positions 

business strategy and competitive advantage 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy our strategy and competitive advantages are based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and a irports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches schools shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy 

business strategies 

our business strategies include 1 aggregates focus 2 coasttocoast footprint 3 profitable growth 4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability  and 5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist our focus on aggregates allows us to  

build and hold substantial reserves  t he location s of our reserves are critical to our longterm success b ecause of barriers to entry created in many metropolitan markets by zoning and permitting regulations and hig h c osts   associated with transporting aggregates  our reserves are strategically located throughout the united states in highgrowth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an d other than energy inputs required to process the materials require virtually no other raw materi al o ur downstream businesses asphalt mix and concrete  u se vulcanproduced aggregates almost exclusively  



 

take advantage of being the largest producer  each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics every operation however uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service vulcan is the largest aggregates company in the us measured by shipments our 344 active aggregates facilities as of december 31 2015 provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment fixed and mobile parts supplies and services in an efficient and costeffective manner both regionally and nationally additionally we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support customer service accounting procurement  technical support and engineering 

2 coasttocoast footprint 

demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly our strategic locations serve nineteen of the top 25 highestgrowth us metropolitan areas and as shown below we serve twenty states plus the district of columbia  

  

  

3 profitable growth 

our longterm growth is a result of strategic acquisition s a nd investments in key operations  

strategic acquisitions and dispositions  since becoming a public company in 1956 vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions for example in 1999 we acquired calmat co thereby expanding our aggregates operations into california and arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc the largest acquisition in our history this acquisition   expanded our aggregates business in florida and our aggregates and readymixed concrete businesses in other southeastern and m idatlantic states  in 2014 we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates busin ess in arizona california new 



 

mexico texas virginia and washington d c our asphalt mix business in arizona and new mexic o a nd our readymixed concrete business in new mexico  in january 2015 we completed an asset exchange transaction in which we exited our readymixed concrete business in california and added thirteen asphalt plant locations primarily in arizona 

additionally throughout our history we have completed many bolton acquisitions that have c ontributed significantly to our growth   for example in 2015 we completed strategic bolton acquisitions in arizona new mexico and tennessee

4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability 

we focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination 







we manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit drivers 

  

  

while aggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years we expect continuing improvement in unit profitability 







5 effective la nd management 

we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue t o fo cus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the 120000 acres of land we currently own 



 

competitive advantages 

the competitive advantages of our aggregates focused business strategy include 

coasttocoast footprint 















profitable growth 







strategically located assets 







product lines 

we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 









see note 15 segment reporting in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

1 aggregates 

our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways 





















 

factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business include 



we operate an extensive logistics network along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard as shown below 

  

  







 









aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel yf unded construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private sector construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than p ublicly funded projects particularly highways roads and bridges  w hich tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 



 

public sector   construction 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges  buildings and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2015  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 49  of our total aggregates shipments 





the federalaid highway program is the largest component of the law and has provided on average 52 of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years the fast act increases federalaid highway program funding from 41 billion in the federal fiscal year ffy 2015 to 47 billion in ffy 2020 this spending is supported by the current userfee revenue streams excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels taxes on heavy truck sales and use and heavy truck tire taxes totaling some 208 billion and by a 70 billion transfer of general funds to the f ederal highway trust fund the funding levels and five years of stability will help to rebuild america’s aging infrastructure and protect millions of jobs 

the fast act also contains important policy changes to further accelerate the project delivery process it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act map21 the new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects—particularly freight projects in states where vulcan operates we are wellpositioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this fast act funding 

although the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program was reduced to 275 million growing to 300 million by 2020 the authorization is still in line with the previous program outlays and remains an important additional component of overall spending the fast act also created a new national surface transportation and innovative finance bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue publicprivate partnerships and other financing arrangements 



unlike tifia wifia as originally crafted did not allow for federal credit assistance to projects financed in whole or in part by tax exempt municipal bonds the fast act lifts that restriction and should make it easier for project sponsors to use the credit program and advance water projects that would otherwise go unaddressed due to the lack of resources 



 

private sector   construction 

the private sector   construction market s i nclude both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are   considerably more cyclical than public construction in 201 5  privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 51  of our total aggregates shipments 



nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in 2016 based on the following assumptions 1 continuing employment growth should provide support as it has in the past 2 current backlogs that our customers and industry groups are reporting should continue to be a source of demand in 201 6 a nd 3 growing state and local tax revenues should provide local governments with the funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population 



us housing starts as measured by dodge analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 06 million units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2015 total annual housing starts increased to more than 11 million unit s the growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad track s  we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15  segment reporting    in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

2  asphalt mix 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california new mexico and texas  this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt m ix segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement  which we purchas e fr om thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt m ix segment customers from our local production facilities 

3  concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in arizona georgia maryland new mexico texas virginia washington dc and the bahamas in may 2015 we entered the arizona readymixed concrete market through the acquisition of readymixed concrete operations in conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in arizona and new mexico in january 2015 we swapped our readymixed concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations primarily in arizona in march 2014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for additional details see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 80 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

ready mixed concrete production also requires cement which w e purchase from third party producers  we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

4 calcium 

as previously noted i n march 2 014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in th e florida area for additional details see note 19 “ acquisitions and divestitures ” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we retained our former cement segment’s calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics water treatment and joint compound industries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

other business  related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart er fu rthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by a number of factors including changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 



 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 201 5  ou r f ive largest customers accounted for 70  of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 23    of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45  to 55    of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and saf ety   examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration  msha  and occupational safety and health administration  osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201 6 and 201 7 will be approximately  125   million and  154 million respectively  these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments 

other information regarding vulcan 

vulcan is a new jersey corporation incorporated on february 14 2007 while its predecessor company was incorporated on september 27 1956 our principal sources of energy are electricity diesel fuel natural gas and coal we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments in 2016

 item 1a   

risk factors 

  

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

ec onomicpolitical risks 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capit al an d operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure —   our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal state and local governments   congress recently passed a fiveyear fully funded bill to invest in roads bridges and public transportation the resulting certainty and the modestly increased investment are positive development s and mitigat e risk in this area in addition eleven vulcanserved states successfully increased transportation funding between 2013 and the present similar efforts are expected in at least three other states in our service area in 2016 however given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending we cannot be entirely assured of the existence amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects   

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions    

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity   

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate chang e l egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs   — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrate d therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volum es in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

the expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations — recycled concrete and asphalt mix are increasingly being used in a number of our markets particularly urban markets as a substitute for aggregates the use of recycled concrete and asphalt mix could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates  



 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry si tes often take years to develop  therefore  our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results w ill depend i n part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits and profit margins are   negatively affected by significant decreases in volume 

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill   —   we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not   identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 1 5 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

we have substantial debt and our credit ratings are noninvestment grade   —   our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments depends on our financial performance financial performance is in turn subject to general economic and business conditions many of which are outside of our control our ability to refinance maturing debt depends on our financial performance and the state of the noninvestment grade debt market which is more volatile than the investmentgrade debt market    

our debt instruments contain customary   covenants including affirmative eg maintain insurance negative eg to limi t our ability to incur secured debt  informational eg provide financial statements and financial eg minimum ebitda to interest ratio covenants if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the r elated debt could become due prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain alternative or additional financing could be impaired 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in critical accounting policies under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use significant judgment in accounting for  

















 

we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business   —   we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments 

other risks 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks — any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of our systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the c osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 



 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals and metals business es  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12  commitments and contingencies    in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty   —   we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal  as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve mark ets in 20 sta tes washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

  

our current estimate of 157   billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects a   de crease of 01 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 



 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations  such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 157   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 201 5   i nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by division  the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 201 5 and the types of facilities operated   

  



  



  

of the 157   billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 201 5  87 billion tons or 56  are located on owned land and 70 billion tons or 44  are located on leased land 



 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our total revenues in 201 5  



  

asphalt mix co nc rete and calcium 

as of december 31 201 5  we o perate d a number of facilities producing asphalt mix readymixed concrete and calcium in several of our divisions as reflected in the table below  

  



  



  

i n january 2015 we exchanged our california western division readymixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt mix pl ants primarily in arizona mountain west division  

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  

  



  

our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products  such as animal feed and plastic s h igh purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse produc ts the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 98  

  

  



 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is  3 6 million 

  




 item 3 

legal proceedings 

  

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels 

we were not subject to any penalties in 2015 for failure to disclose transactions identified by the internal revenue service as abusive under internal revenue code section 6707a 

see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of our material legal proceedings

executive leadership team and our five core disciplines 

in 201 4  we announced a n executive leadership team   led by tom hill c hairma n a nd chief executive officer joining mr hill o n the leadership team were john mcpherson executive vice president chief financial and strategy officer stan bass  chief growth officer  and michael mills  chief administrative officer    each member of the executive leadership team has significant seniorlevel general and industry specific business experience 

under the leadership of ou r e xecutive leadership team we have instituted the following five core disciplines that we focus on daily 

  

1 sales and marketing excellence 

goal remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services 

execution we are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships 

2 operational excellence 

goal lead the markets safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60 flow through of incremental aggregates revenue 

execution we are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multimodal logistic s network and by better managing inventory levels in 2015 we exceeded our longterm flow through goal of 60 by achieving 77 flow through of incremental aggregates revenue on a samestore basis 

3 s elling  administrative and general sag productivity 

goal continue to leverage sag in order to achieve 6 of revenues 

execution we are leveraging our recently reorganized central shared services and recently implemented common erp platform to reduc e a dministrative expenses and enable rapid integration of acquired operations as a result sag as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 9 1  in 201 4 to 84  in 2015 

4 capital productivity 

goal drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base 

execution we are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels 

5 portfolio management 

goal continue to pursue attractive bolton acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting noncore businesses 

execution in 2015 we completed a swap of twelve readymixed concrete plants in california for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in arizona we also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven readymixed concrete plants in arizona and new mexico these transactions together with acquisitions completed in 2014 position us as the 1 aggregates supplier in the new mexico market and a leading aggregates supplier in arizona 



 

201 5   acquisitionsdivestitu r es 

we continually challenge ourselves as to whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations —   this logic supports the transaction we closed in january 2015   to exchange   our california readymixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt   mix plants primarily in arizona we expect to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets due to our operational and strategic focus in the arizona asphalt market in addition  we acquired the following in 2015 





for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

market developments and outlook 

we expect overall demand growth in vulcanserved markets to be approximately 7 in 2016 driven by continued growth in both private and public construction private construction activity should continue to grow in both residential and nonresidential led by doubledigit growth in the residential sector  public construction in our markets should continue to benefit from stateled highway spending in key states and record levels of state and local tax receipts additionally with the passage of the new fully funded longterm federal highway bill in december 2015 the states now have greater funding stability and certainty to undertake much needed transportation projects as a result we believe that midsingle digit growth for this aggregatesintensive end  market is possible in 2016  

at this point in the recovery the timing and pace of shipments throughout the year can be marginally more uncertain due to weatherrelated challenges and the start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects for example el ninorelated rainfall has negatively impacted early 2016 shipment rates in our california arizona and new mexico operations these factors coupled with public transportation agencies needing time to adjust their project procurement schedules to incorporate passage of the new federal highway bill could result in full year aggregates shipments being weighted towards the second half of the year 

we expect full year adjusted ebitda of 10 to 11 billion driven by  1 the continuing recovery in demand from the trough seen in 2012 2 strong growth in aggregates gross profit per ton 3 earnings improvement in our nonaggregates businesses and 4 continuing leverage of our sag expenses 

the following assumptions which represent the midpoint of our expectations support our outlook for strong yearoveryear growth in adjusted ebitda in 20 16 











  

other expectations include 









  

our 2015 results and 2016 outlook are consistent with our long  range expectations since the beginning of this recovery in the second half of 2013 our teams’ efforts have res ulted in trailing twelve month a ggregates segment gross profit increasing nearly 400 million on a 38 million ton increase in annualized shipments we are encouraged by the ongoing recovery in demand continuing across our markets and by the positive pricing environment our teams continue to convert incremental revenue into incremental gross profit at an impressive rate our focus will remain on continuous compounding improvement – both operational and financial 



 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

gross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results likewise we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent passthrough activities reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below

ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and excludes discontinued operations we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period 

  





 

results of operations 

total revenues include sales of product to customers net of any discounts and taxes and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers related freight and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review our consolidated results of operations  we discuss separately our discontinued operations which consist s of our former chemicals business 

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda

adjusted concrete and calcium segment financial data 

the following table compares our concrete and calcium segments financial data excluding both the january 2015 exchange of our california concrete businesses and the march 2014 sale of our florida area concrete and cement businesses 





 

operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four operating and report able segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2  asphalt mi x   3  concrete and 4 calcium  management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments  







at 1783 million tons our 2015 aggregates shipments increased 159 million tons this increase is consistent with our longrange expectations the gradual recovery in demand continues across most of our 20state geographic footprint with the exception of certain markets in texas construction activity in vulcanserved markets remains well below longterm levels of per capita consumption key states such as california florida and georgia continue to enjoy solid growth rates as they gradually recover toward more normal levels of construction activity and materials consumption    on a samestore basis aggregates shipments increased 118 million tons or 7  

the following map reflects   the percentage improvement   2015 versus 2014 of aggregates shipments on a samestore basis by vulcanserved state s  

  



 

our yearover year freight adjusted selling price 1   for aggregates  









  

our pricing environment continues to improve with the steady increase in demand during 2015 freightadjusted sales price increased in all vulcanserved states on a samestore basis freightadjusted sales price also increased 7 



  



  

aggregates segment gross profit increased  2116 million in 2015 from the prior year and gross profit as a percentage of freightadjusted revenues increased 54 percentage points 54 0 basis points the increase in aggregates segment gross profit resulted from higher volumes and better unit margins aggregates segment unit cost of sales excluding freight and delivery declined 1 in 2015 versus the prior year as lower diesel and energy costs offset higher fringe and overtime labor expenses and repair  maintenance costs 



 

aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 16 to 552 in 2015 this measure continues to improve reflecting our effective management of the three major profit drivers price for service sales and production mix operating efficiency and leverage these efforts resulted in a record level of unit profitability that exceeds the level achieved in 2005 328 per ton – our peak year for volume and in 20 14 4 75 per ton – our previous high this trend further highlights the earnings potential of our aggregates business as volumes recover 

this aggregates earnings potential is further reflected in the flowthrough rate s amestore aggregates freightadjusted revenues increased  27 19 million in 2015 while samestore gross profit for the segment increased 2093 million a flowthrough rate of 77 we have consistently exceeded our stated longterm goal of a 60 flowthrough rate since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013 

2  asphalt mix 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 







the significant increase in asphalt mix shipments was largely attributable to the swap of our concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations primarily in arizona on a samestore basis  asphalt mix shipments increased 10 and gross profit increased 308 million 

unit gross profit increased 58  in 2015 while unit cash gross profit increased 49  to  980 per ton this improvement resulted from the increased level of shipments effective management of materials margins and earnings from acquisitions completed since the first half of last year 



  



 

3  concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 







the significant decrease in readymixed concrete shipments was largely attributable to the afore mentioned swap of our concrete operations in california on a samestore basis  readymixed concrete shipments increased 7  and gross profit increased  89 million 



  



  



 

4 calcium 

calcium segment gross profit of  3 5 million was up 03 million from reported prior year   gross profit of 32 million  our cement business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 along with the florida concrete assets adjusted for the sale of our cement business in the florida area calcium segment gross profit was 35 mill ion in 2014 



  



  

in total the 2015 gross profit contributions from our three nonaggregates asphalt m ix concrete and calcium segments exceeded plan due to margin improvements resulting from both core operating disciplines and strategic repositioning of our asset portfolio 

selling administrative and general expenses 

in millions 

  

  

we experienced elevated sag costs during 2015 primarily due to higher pension and other employee benefit costs as well as continued investment in sales force effectiveness and other strategic initiatives other employee benefit costs such as those associated with enhancements to the employee profitsharing plan also have risen in contrast direct sag expenses for salaries and wages remained relatively flat with the prior year we intend to further leverage sag expenses to revenues as volumes recover as a percentage of total revenues sag expenses declined from 91 in 2014 to 84 in 201 5   in 2016 sag expenses are expected to increase approximately 3 while revenues should increase doubledigits   

our comparative total company employment levels at year end 







severance charges included in sag expenses were as follows   201 5 —  14 million 201 4 —  10 million and 201 3 —  12 million    severance and other related restructuring charges not included in sag expenses were as follows 201 5 —  50 million  201 4 —  13 million and 201 3 —  15 million  



 

ga in on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses 

in millions 

  

  

the 2015 gain includes a 59 million pretax gain from the previously mentioned asset exchange we exited the readymixed concrete business in california and added thirteen asphalt plant locations primarily in arizon a t he 2014 gain includes a  2279 million pretax gain from the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in florida to cementos argos and a 60 million pretax gain from the sale of two reclaimed operating site s t he 2013 gain includes a 240 million pretax gain from the sale of five nonstrategic aggregates production facilities and a 90 million pretax gain from the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate    see note 19 acquisitions and divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   

interest expense 

in millions 

  

  

interest expense in 2015 decreased 228 million from 2014 due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate and a 58 million reduction in pretax charges for debt purchases interest expense in 2015 and 2014 included pretax charges for debt purchases of  671 million and 729 million respectively as described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial stat ements and supplementary data” 

income taxes 

our income tax provision  benefit  from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

  



  

the 33 million increase in our 2015 provision for incomes taxes is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our earnings from continuing operations  the 2015 reduction in the effective tax rate is due to higher benefits from the statutory depletion deduction and the us production deduction both related to higher aggregates sales   the 1162 million increase in our 2014 income taxes is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our earnings from continuing operations   a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 201 5  201 4 and 20 13 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings loss from discontinued operations were 







the  1 93 million and 37 million losses from discontinued operations for 2015 and 2014 respectively resulted primarily from general and product liability costs including legal defense cost s a nd environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business the 2013 pretax earnings includ e an 117 million g ain relat ed to the 5cp earnout final payment in 2013 this gain was partially offset by general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5cp earnout see note 2 discontinued operations i n item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and financial resources 

our sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial committed bank line of credit additional financial resources include access to the capital markets the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these liquidity and financial resources are sufficient to fund ou r b usiness requirements for 201 6  including 













our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged from the prior year we intend to take a balanced approach to capital deployment one incorporating strategic reinvestment sustained financial strength and flexibility and the return of capital to shareholders in 2015 we returned 532 million in cash to shareholders though our dividend and 215 million through share repurchases we expect to increase the return of capital through dividends  share repurchases  or other mechanisms as earnings grow 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 









during 2015 we maintained debt of approximately 20 billion eliminated nearerterm maturities increased the weightedaverage life of our debt obligations and lowered our weightedaverage interest rate by approximately 1 100 basis points 



 

cash 

included in our december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents balance of  2841 million is  589 million of cash held at on e of our foreign subsidiaries  a ll of this  589 million of cash relates to earning s th at are indefinitely reinvested offshore use of thi s c ash is currently limited to our foreign operations

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings befor e n oncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

  



  

  



  

201 5 versus 201 4 —   net cash provided by operating activities was 5034 million durin g 2 015 a 243 1 million increase compared t o 2 014 n et earnings before noncash deduction for ddaa increased 116 million during 2015 to 4960 million included in net earnings for 2014 is a pretax gain of 2279 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” from the march 2014 sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area cash received associated with gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities in 2015 we purchased 4851 million principal amount of outstanding debt and incurred charges of 671 million in 2014 we purchased 5064 million principal amount of outstanding debt and incurred charges of 729 million see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” cash paid for the debt purchases is presented as a component of financing activities 

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash provided by operating activities of 2603 million decreased 962 million from 2013 the decrease is attributable to a transaction in 2013 in which we sold a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of 1531 million see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary dat a”   net earnings before noncash deductions for ddaa increased 1529 million to 4844 million during 2014 included in net earnings for 2014 is a pretax gain of 2279 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” from the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area cash received associated with the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities additionally we purchased 5064 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer and incurred a charge of 729 million see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” cash paid for the debt purchase is presented as a component of financing activities  



 

cash from investing activities 

in millions 

  

201 5 versus 201 4 — net cash used for investing activities was 3097 million during 2015 a 548 0 million decrease compared to the 2383 million of net cash provided durin g 2 014 this decrease is the result of lower proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses less cash used in acquisitions and higher capital investments in our existing operations during 201 4  we sold a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land for 107 million land previously containing a sales yard for 58 million and our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for 7214 million we had no comparable significant sales in the current year during 2014 we completed several acquisitions for cash consideration of 2842 million conversely acquisitions durin g 2 01 5 t otaled 272 million in cash consideration see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” furthermore during 2015 we increased investments in our existing operations by 644 million as reflected in the increased purchases of property plant  equipment 

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash provided by investing activities increased 5345 million during 2014 this increase resulted from a 6782 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses partially offset by a 1438 million increase in purchases of property plant  equipment and businesses during 2014 we sold a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land for 107 million land previously containing a sales yard for 58 million and our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for 7214 million in the same period we completed several acquisitions for total consideration of 3318 million of which 2842 million was paid in cash see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

cash from financing activities 

in millions 

  

201 5 versus 201 4 — net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was 508 million a decrease of 5003 million fro m 2 014 this large decrease is primarily attributable to the prior year’s 5064 million principal amount debt purchase which required 5797 million of cash the 2014 debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area in 2015  we refinanced 6351 million principal amount of debt and entered into a new 7500 million line of credit the total cash requirement for these actions was 7023 million 6351 million principal 593 million of premiums above par and transaction fees of 79 million we funded the refinancing by issuing 4000 million of new 10year notes borrowing 2350 million under our new and expanded line of credit and using 673 million of cash furthermore in 2014 we generated 306 million of cas h b y issuing new shares to our 401k plan such issuances were discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2014 finally in 2015 we returned capital to our investors by repurchasing 228 0 thousand shares of common stock for cash consideration of 21 5 million 



 

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash used for financing activities of 5511 million increased 4091 million in 2014 compared to 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to the aforementioned 5064 million principal amount purchase that required  5797 million of cash  this increase in cash used for financing activities is partially offset by a 268 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2014 we issued 4853 thousand shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k savings and retirement plans for cash proceeds of 306 million

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 















1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2015 goodwill represents 37  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates assumptions and judgment 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level one level below our operating segments we have identified 18 reporting units of which 9 carry goodwill we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a twostep quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  





step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair valu e representing implied goodwill 





 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni ts   using bo th an income approach  which involves discounting estimated future cash flows  and a market approach    which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies   w e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models  finally to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization 

our fair value assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control o r u nderperformance relative to historical or projecte d o perating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 201 5  net p roperty plant  equipment represents 38  of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 9  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates  assumptions and judgment the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 



 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impai rment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg    a sphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates determines the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2015 we recorded a  52 million loss on impairment of longlived assets resulting from exiting a lease    during 201 4  we recorded a  31 million impairment loss related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area see note 19 acquisitions and divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   we recorded no asset impairments during 2013  

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations these assets totaled  3730   million at december 31 201 5  representing an approximate 1    de crease from december 31 201 4  of the total    3730 million  approximately 40  relates to re al estate held for future development and expansion of o ur op erations in addition  approximately   2 5  is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 3 5  is composed of aggregates a sphalt mix and r eadymix ed concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products we anticipate moving   idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 property plant  equipment and note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

3 reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions an d j udgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations  2266 million as of december 31 201 5 and  2266 million as of december 31 2014  

how we determine fair value of the obligation 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost  including a reasonable profit margin  for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation task s this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

w e evaluat e c urrent facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 asset retirement obligations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review the following primary assumption s 









how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we consider the yield on highquality bonds with a duration equal to the duration of plan liabilitie s a t december 31 201 5  the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 353  to 468  december 31 201 4 ranged from 350  to 4 3 0  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 201 5  the expected return on plan assets remains at 750  

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligation s a nd the annual ne t b enefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

  



  

as of the december 31 201 5 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets dec reased annually from  8170 million to  7457   million du e t o unfavorable investment returns and lumpsum settlement payments to a group of terminated vested participants  no   contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 201 5  

during 2016 we expect to recognize net pensio n credit o f approximately  62 million and net postretirement credit of approximately  37 million compared to expenses of  159 million and  02 million respectively in 2015 the de crease s   are primarily due to a change in estimate beginning in 2016 we are changing the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans historically we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cos t  a pplying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows 



 

we are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial gain loss reported 

we are accounting for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly are accounting for it prospectively starting in 2016 the estimated weightedaverage discount rates used to measure servic e a nd interest cos t s for 2016 are 489  and 380  respectively for our pension plans and 405  and 281  respectively for our other postretirement plans the weighted  average discount rates that we would have used for service and interest costs under our prior estimation technique were 454  for the pension plans and 369  for the other postretirement plans the reductions in benefit cost for 2016 associated with this change are estimated to be  7 2 million   and  05 million   for our pension and other postretirement plans respectively 

we do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 2016 and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 benefit plans in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

5 environmental compliance costs 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs   our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs  we 







at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur  but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study  when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 201 5  the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was  32 million   our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts h owever   a number of factors including adverse agency rulings an d u nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 accrued environmental remediation costs in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program  we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to  20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to  30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance  

7 income taxes 

valuation of our deferred tax assets 

we fil e f ederal state and foreign income tax returns   and a ccount for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met hod we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities  which reflect our best assessment of th e f uture taxes we will pay  based on the differences between the financial statement ’s carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes  deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns   while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns 

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

at december 31 2015 we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of  617 million against which we have a valuation allowance of  552 million of the deferred tax assets  589 million relates to alabama 

from 2008 through the second quarter of 2015 we carried a full valuation allowance against the alabama deferred tax asset for the following reasons 





during the second quarter of 2015 we restructured our legal entities among other benefits we anticipated that the restructuring would generate significant taxable income in alabama and therefore allow for the utilization of some or all of the alabama deferred tax asset 

our alabama cumulative loss is calculated as pretax earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations and other comprehensive income plus permanent differences over the last three years while evaluating all available positive and 



 

negative evidence realizing the significance of the restructuring in our alabama income tax filing we determined that it was appropriate to adjust our alabama cumulative loss calculation to consider the restructuring remove pretax earnings fr o m discontinued operations and other comprehensive income and remove any other significant nonrecurring items we refer to this calculation as our alabama adjusted earnings 

at the end of the second quarter our alabama adjusted earnings were negative however the alabama adjusted earnings loss was dramatically smaller than our alabama cumulative loss of the three adjustments made the restructuring had the greatest impact in addition we considered all other forms of positive and negative evidence including the four sources of taxable income the first three sources of taxable income carryback potential reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies provided very little positive evidence because our alabama adjusted earnings were a loss we did not project future alabama taxable income the fourth source as a result during the second quarter we continued to carry a full valuation allowance against our alabama deferred tax asset 

at the end of the third quarter our alabama adjusted earnings turned positive this development provided sufficient positive evidence such that we determined it was appropriate to utilize projections of future alabama taxable income in our assessment for the first time however because we had not yet returned to sustained profitability ie three consecutive years of positive alabama adjusted earnings we used our alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings as the basis for an objectively verifiable projection of future alabama taxable income this projection in addition to considering all other positive and negative evidence led us to conclude in the thir d qu art er th at it was more likely than not that  47 million of the deferred tax asset was realizable therefore we recognized a deferred tax benefi t of 47 millio n i n the third quarter by reducing the valuation allowance  our fourth quarter analysis further confirmed our third quarter conclusions but resulted in no further reductions of the valuation allowance  

we believe that i f or when we have three consecutive years of positive alabama adjusted earnings we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that we have retur ned to sustained profitability and will no longer limit our estimate of future taxable incom e t o our alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings at that time  we expect to realize a significant portion if not all of the alabama deferred tax asset   we project that the earliest this could happen would be the fourth quarter of 2016 

l iability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

we recognize a ta x benefit associated with a t ax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position  for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold w e m easure th e income t ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realiz ed a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position ou r liability for u nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments a nd new or emerging legislation 

the   years open   to   tax examinations vary by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is appropriate  

we consider a   tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination    or the expiration of the statute of limitati ons upon resolution of a tax position an y liability for u nrecognized tax benefits will be released 

ou r liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our   liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits as income tax expense

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as discussed in the liquidity and financial resources section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and financial risk such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense in addition to floatingrate borrowings under our line of credit we at times utiliz e i nterest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floatingrate debt 

while floatingrate debt exposes us to rising interest rates it is typically cheaper than issuing fixedrate debt at any point in time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixedrate debt however a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results since 2002 our ebitda and operating income are correlated to floating interest rates as measured by 3month libor as such our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates and floatingrate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results 

at december 31 2015 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt including current maturities was  22049 million compared to a book value of  19805 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by  1114 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds and the expected return on plan assets the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d    1 5e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 201 5  based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

no material changes were made d uring the fourth quarter of 201 5 to our internal controls over financial reporting  nor have there been o ther factors that materially affect these controls 

management s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

under managements supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 201 5

report of independent registered public accounting firm – internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the company as of december 31 201 5 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 201 5 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 201 5 and our report dated february 25  201 6 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 

business 

  

vulcan materials company  a new jersey corporation  is the nation’s largest produ cer of construction aggregates  primarily crushed stone san d and gravel  and a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete  we operated   335 a ggregates facilities during 201 4  

vulcan’s value proposition 

we are t he largest producer of construction aggregates in the country with coasttocoast aggregates operations our leading position is based upon 





t hese factors allow us to provide attractive unit profitability through our strong operating expertise and price discipline 

  

strategy for existing and new markets   





  



 

source moody’s analytics as of august 15  20 14 





competitors 

we operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers account ed for approximately   30  to 35  of to tal us aggregates production   in 201 4  despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than   10  o ther publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5000 companies managing over   10000 operations during 201 4  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or by extending   their existing market positions   



 

business strategy 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and a irports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches schools shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy 

our business strategies include 1 aggregates focus 2 coasttocoast footprint 3 profitable growth 4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability  and 5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist our focus on aggregates allows us to  





2 c oasttocoast   footprint 

demand for construction aggregates   correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly in 201 4  we expanded our operational footprint i n arizona california texa s v irginia and washington dc  and accessed new markets in new mexico through acquisitions these acquisitions totaling  3 318   million of investment added more than 4 4 0 million tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves serving markets where reserves are relatively scarce 

the following graphic illustrates our projected percentage share of the growth   2010 – 2020 by key demographics   for the united states  

  

source moody’s analytics as of august 15  20 14  



 

in january 2015 we exited the concrete market in california by swapping our readymix concrete operations for asphalt mix operations  primarily in arizona 

  

3 profitable growth 

our longterm growth is a result of strategic acquisition s a nd investments in key operations  



in addition to these large acquisitions we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth 





 

4 managing volume product mix and price to grow profitability 

we commonly think of three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination  







we manage these factors locally and align o u r talent and incentives accordingly our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilitie s a llo w us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressive ly  as a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing  since 2012 ou r aggregates segment’s g ross profit   has increased 55 on volume improvement of 15   

  

  

while aggregates segment gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years we have not yet fully realized our maximum unit profitability 







5 effective la nd management 

we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue t o fo cus our actions on prudent decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future 



 

product lines 

we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 









1 aggregates 

a number of factors affect the us aggregates industry and our busines s i ncluding markets the location and quality of reserves and demand cycles 











 

i n addition the following factors influence the aggregates market 













  

aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market  we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector   construction 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2014  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 50  of our total aggregates shipments 





 



map21 maintained essentially level f unding in fiscal year s 201 4   and 2015  w ith approximately 105 billion for total transportation funding   through fiscal year 2014  it extends the highway trust fund and tax collections through fiscal year 2016 adding additional stability to the federal highway program congressional leaders have stated their intention to act in 2015 to replace the extension of map21 with a multiyear authorization that includes revenue stability for federal surface transportation programs 

the extension of map21 maintained the baseline increase to the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program funding for this program increase d to 175 billion over the twoyea r m ap21 period  from 122 million per year under the previous multiyear highway bill known as safetealu  tifia funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10  creating the potential for 175 billion in additional major project funding for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 the us department of transportation estimates this tifia funding support s 30 to 50 billion in new construction g iven administrative requirements and other factors the tifia program began to have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments in 2014 and should continue to do so into 2015 and beyond 

tifia is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the united states including large portions of our footpri nt the program provide s c redit assistance in the form of secured loans loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure project s e ligible sponsor s i nclude state and local governments private firms special authorities and transportation improvement districts eligible projects include highways and bridges large multimodal projects as well as freight transfer and transit facilities we are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of tifiafunded projects 

m ap21 ’s positive framework for future authorizations was continued in the extension passed this summer its significant reforms consolidation and simplification of federal highway programs acceleration of the project delivery process and expanded project financing and promotion of publicprivate partnership opportunities have paved the way for further progress as congress works to pass a new multiyear highway bill   



  



 

private sector   construction 

the private sector   construction market s i nclude both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are   considerably more cyclical than public construction in 201 4  privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 50  of our total aggregates shipments 



c ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggregates in 201 4  total nonresidential contract awards as measured in square feet increased for the 4th year in a row p rivate nonresidential contract awards were up approximately 59 million square feet or 9  office buildings retail construction and manufacturing facilities accounted for all of this growt h em ployment gro wth att ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market 



us housing starts as measured by dodge analytics data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 600000 units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2014 total annual housing starts surpassed 1 million unit s the growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad track s  we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15  segment reporting    in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

  



 

our competitive advantages 

the competitive advantages of our aggregates focused strategy include 

coasttocoast footprint 













profitable growth 







strategically located assets 







2  asphalt mix 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california new mexico and texas  this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt m ix segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement  which we purchas e fr om thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt m ix segment customers from our local production facilities 



 

3  concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in ge orgia maryland new mexico texas virginia  washington dc and the bahamas    i n   jan uary 2015 we swapped our readymixed concrete operations in california for asphalt mix operations    primarily in arizo na 

in march 2 014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in th e florida area for additional details see note 19 “ acquisitions and divestitures ” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 78 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment primarily through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

ready mixed concrete production also requires cement which w e purchase from third party producers  we do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

4 calcium formerly cement  

as previously noted i n march 2 014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in th e florida area for additional details see note 19 “ acquisitions and divestitures ” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we retained our former cement segment’s calcium operation in brooksville florida this facility produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics water treatment and joint compound industries with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

other business  related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart er fu rthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by a number of factors including changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 201 4  ou r f ive largest customers accounted for 64  of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 22    of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45  to 5 5    of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and saf ety   examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration  msha  and occupational safety and health administration  osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201 5 and 201 6 will be approximately  110   million and  107 million respectively  these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 item 1a   

risk factors 

  

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

ec onomicpolitical risks 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capit al an d operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax  among other provisions the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule referred to as the tailoring rule   which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act with the sale of our newberry cement plant in march 2014 we no longer have a facility subject to either the reporting or permitting rule  although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts  such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate chang e l egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs   — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrate d therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volum es in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 



 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — constru ct ion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry si tes often take years to develop  therefore  our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results w ill depend i n part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits and profit margins are   negatively affected by significant decreases in volume 

significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill   —   we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 1 4 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

we have substantial debt and our credit ratings are noninvestment grade   —   o ur operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest and in some years principal payments our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payment s d epends on our operating and financial performance our ability to refinance maturing debt depends on our financial performance and the state of the capital markets particularly for noninvestment grade debt  operating and financial performance is in turn subject to general economic and business conditions many of which are outside of our control  

our debt instruments contain variou s covenants including a ffirmativ e  eg m aintai n i nsurance negativ e  eg restrictions on lines of business informational eg provide financial statements and financial eg minimum ebitda to interest ratio covenants  if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain alternative or additional financing could be impaired 



 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in critical accounting policies under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use significant judgment in accounting for  















we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our future success is dependent upon a management team and divisional structure that are new   — since january 1 2014 we have experienced significant changes in our management team as part of the company’s management succession plan and new divisio n o rganizational structure our future success depends in large part upon the effective transition of our new management team and the new divisional structure if there are further changes in management or organizational structure such changes could be disruptive and could negatively affect our operations strategic planning and performance 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business   —   we have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments 

other risks 

we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks — any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of our systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations there is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyberattack such as an infiltration of a data center or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our thirdparty providers while we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 



 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the c osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals and metals business es  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty   —   we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal  as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve mark ets in 20 sta tes washington dc and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

  

  

our current estimate of 158   billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s reflects an increase of 08 billion tons from the prior year’s estimate  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 



 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations  such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity  grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 158   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 201 4   i nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by region  the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 201 4 and the types of facilities operated   

  



  



  

of the 158   billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 201 4  88 billion tons or 56  are located on owned land and 70 billion tons or 44  are located on leased land 



 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our total revenues in 201 4  



  

asphalt mix co nc rete and calcium formerly cement 

as of december 31 2014 w e o perate d a number of facilities producing other products in several of our regions   as reflected in the table below  

  



  



  

subsequently in january 2015 we exchanged our california readymixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt mix plants primarily in arizona west region 

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our calcium segment operates a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  

  



  

our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products  such as animal feed plastics and paint high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse produc ts the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 981 

  



 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is  34 million 

  




 item 3 

legal proceedings 

  

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels 

see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of our material legal proceedings

market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

  

our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange ticker symbol vmc as of february 11  201 5  the number of shareholders of record was 3316  the prices in the following table represent the high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange and the quarterly dividends declared by our board of directors in 201 4 and 201 3  

  



  

the future payment of dividends is within the discretion of our board of directors and depends on our profitability capital requirements financial condition debt levels growth projects business opportunities and other factors which our board of directors deems relevant as explained under the “debt” caption of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” our line of credit contains covenants that limit our ability to make restrictive payments including dividends such limitation currently does not impact our ability to execute our financial plans and becomes less restrictive when the line of credit becomes unsecured 

on february 13  201 5  our board declared a dividend of ten cent s per share for the first quarter of 201 5  this represents a four cent per share increase over the prior quarter 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

we did not have any repurchases of stock during the fourth quarter of 201 4  we did not have any unregistered sales of equity securities during the fourth quarter of 201 4

new executive leadership team and divisional structure 

in 201 4  we announced a new executive leadership team   led by tom hill president and chief executive officer joining mr hill o n the leadership team w ere john mcpherson  executive vice president chief financial and strategy officer stan bass senior vice president  west region  and michael mills senior vice president and general counsel we also introduced a new divisional organization structur e ef fective january 1 2015 this new structure enables us to pursue growth and profitability while further leveraging the erp and shared services platforms implemented in 2012 

201 4   strategic acquisitions divestitu r es 



















in the first quarter of 2014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area to cementos argos   argos for net pretax cash proceeds of  7 214 million resulting in a pretax gain of  2 114 million   net of 165 million of disposition related charges  we retained all of our florida aggregates operations our former cement segment’s calcium operation in brooksville florida and real estate associated with certain former readymixed concrete facilities under a separate supply agreement we will continue to provide aggregates to the divested concrete facilities at market prices for a period of 20 years 

given our aggregates focus ed strategy argos is a better owner of those assets than we were our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capitalintensive businesses in our portfolio we continually challenge ourselves as to whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations —   this logic supports the argos divestiture and also underpins the smaller transaction we closed in late january 2015   to exchange   our california readymixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt   mix plants primarily in arizona we expect to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets due to our operational and strategic focus in the arizona asphalt market 

for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

market developments 

aggregates demand is in the early stages of recovery   and remains well below normalized levels the pattern of recovery is increasingly broadbased and f or the first time since 2005 demand in each of the four major end markets increased versus the prior year we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with longterm trends 

construction activity in our markets grew faster than us markets as a whole in 2014 led by growth in private construction residential construction activity measured in housing starts continues to recover from depressed levels of demand to more normalized levels needed to support demographics private nonresidential construction activity continues to benefit from growth in office and commercial as well as large industrial projects along the coasts of texas and louisiana where we are well positioned to provide aggregates to an area deprived of naturally occurring sources suitable for construction we see demand from private enduses up 14 to 18 during 2015 private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued strength in family and multifamily housi ng  ou r employment and housing assumptions are consistent with consensus forecasts and reflect that our markets are growing faster than the rest of the u nited s tates  



 

public construction continues to realize steady growth due mostly to strong awards for new projects in 2013 and early in 2014 as well as large transportationrelated projects funded through the federal government’s tifia program we currently expect these trends in demand in each of the major end markets to continue in 2015   we   believe demand from public enduses will increase 3 to 5 during 2015 construction award momentum remains positive and stable in our markets the s outh and w est continue to see more growth than other areas of the u nited s tates  state and local tax revenue growth has mirrored the economic recovery as tax revenues approach all time high levels they will supply the support for new public funding 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

gross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results likewise we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent passthrough activities reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below

ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and excludes discontinued operations we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period 

  





 

results of operations 

total revenues include sales of product to customers net of any discounts and taxes and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers related freight and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review our consolidated results of operations  we discuss separately our discontinued operations which consist s of our former chemicals business 

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda

yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 

  



  

operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four operating and report able segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2  asphalt mi x    3  concrete and 4 calcium formerly cement   management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments  







sales volume momentum improved across most of our 20state geographic footprint this growing momentum is driven by strengthening construction activity across all enduse markets and an increasing number of large projects on a samestore basis aggregates shipments increased 150 million tons or 10 florida georgia illinois texas and virginia saw shipment increases in excess of 10 over the prior year on a samestore basis this strong broadbased growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand from largeproject work in both private and public endmarkets 

residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint led by growth in multifamily housing while the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed key markets in california florida georgia   and texas continue to post aboveaverage growth rates private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the us as a whole this is driven by office commercial and manufacturing projects   —   and by growth in construction activity along the gulf coast where w e are uniquely positioned  in the public sector shipments for highways has remained solid due to strong contract awards in 2013 increases in state highway funding a growing number of tifiafunded projects in key states and the extension of map21    the federal highway bill   

our yearover year freight adjusted selling price 1   for aggregates  







  

  





 

our pricing environment continues to improve with the gradual improvement in demand during 2014 we realized modest price improvements in all but one of our management reporting units across our 20state geographic footprint pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography 

  



  



  

aggregates segment gross profit increased  13 08 million from the prior year and gross profit as a percentage of freightadjusted revenues increased 41 percentage points 410 basis points the increase in aggregates segment gross profit resulted from higher volumes and better unit margins  

aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 9 to 475 in 2014 this measure continues to improve reflecting our effective management of the three major profit drivers  price for service sales and production mix operating efficiency and leverage  these efforts resulted in a record level of unit profitability that exceeds the level achieved in 2005 328 per ton – our peak year for volume and in 2008 469 per ton – our previous high   this trend further highlights the earnings potential of our aggregates business as volumes recover 



 

2  asphalt mix 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 







asphalt mix segment gross profit of  381 million was up    54 million from the prior year   due to higher margins in california and the earnings contribution from recently completed acquisitions in arizona and new mexico on a samestore basis asphalt volumes increased 4 from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6  



  



 

3  concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 







c oncrete segment gross profit was 22 million in 2014 compared to a loss of 248 million in 2013 adjusted for the sale of our concrete business in the florida area concrete segment gross profit was 59 million compared to a loss of 03 million in 2013   readymixed concrete   shipments declined in 2014 as a result of the sale of our florida concrete business in the first quarter of 2014 adjusted for the sale of our concrete business in the florida area readymix ed concrete shipments increased 10    in 2014

the 1162 million increase in our 2014 provision for income taxes   and t he  420 million de crease in our 2013 benefit from income taxes   are primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our earnings from continuing operations    a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 201 4  201 3 and 20 12 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings loss from discontinued operations were 







the  37 million loss from discontinued operations resulted primarily from general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business the 2013 and 2012 pretax earnings includ e g ains relat ed to the 5cp earnout final payment in 2013 of  117 and 10 2 million  respectively these gains were partially offset by general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5cp earnout see note 2 discontinued operations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets additional sources of liquidity include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these liquidity and financial resources are sufficient to fund ou r b usiness requirements for 2015  including 











we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 











 

cash 

included in our december 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents balance of  1413 million is  522 million of cash held at on e of our foreign subsidiaries  a ll of the  522 million of cash relates to earnings prior to january 1 2012 that are permanently reinvested offshore use of this permanently reinvested cash is currently limited to our foreign operations 

cash from operating activities 

in millions 

  

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings befor e n oncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

  



  

  

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash provided by operating activities of 2 603 million decreased 9 62 million from 2013 the decrease is attributable to a transaction in 2013 in which we sold a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of 1531 million see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary dat a”   net earnings before noncash deductions for ddaa increased 1529 million to 4844 million during 2014 included in net earnings for 2014 is a pretax gain of 2279 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” from the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area cash received associated with the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities additionally we purchased 5064 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer and incurred a loss of 729 million see note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” cash paid for the debt purchase is presented as a component of financing activities  

2013 versus 2012 — net cash provided by operating activities of  3565 million in creased  1180 million from 2012 due primarily to a 795 million increase in proceeds from the sale of future production in september 2013 we entered into a second transaction to sell a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of  1531 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” additionally as noted in the table above net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization in creased  521 million in 2013 compared with 2012 



 

cash from investing activities 

in millions 

  

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash provided by investing activities increased 53 45 million during 2014 this increase resulted from a 67 82 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses partially offset by a 1438 million increase in purchases of property plant  equipment and businesses during 2014 we sold a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land for 107 million land previously containing a sales yard for 58 million and our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for 7214 million in the same period we completed several acquisitions for total consideration of 3318 million of which 2842 million was paid in cash see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2013 versus 2012 — net cash used for investing activities in creased  3066 million in 201 3  this in crease resulted from   a 2720 million increase in the purchase of property plant  equipment and businesses and a 328 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses during 2013 we acquired three aggregates production facilities and four readymixed concrete facilities for approximately 900 million   and land containing 136 million tons of reserves for 1170 million  we also sold five aggregates production facilities one replacement reserve site and reclaimed land associated with a former site of a readymixed concrete facility for approximately 511 million 

cash from financing activities 

in millions 

  

201 4 versus 201 3 — net cash used for financing activities of 5511 million increased 4091 million in 2014 compared to 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to a  4292 million increase in debt payments   net of draws on our line of credit   as previously mentioned in 2014 we purchased 5064 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer as follows 3750 million of 650 notes due in 2016 and 1314 million of 640 notes due in 2017 total tender costs were 5797 million including 718 million premium and 15 million in transaction costs this increase in cash used for financing activities is partially offset by a 268 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2014 we issued 05 million shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k savings and retirement plans for cash proceeds of 306 million 

2013 versus 2012 — net cash used for financing activities of 1420 million in creased  128 million in 2013 compared to 2012 this increase in cash used for financing activities is attributable to a 15 8 million increase in de bt payments during 2013 we made scheduled debt payments of 100 million in january to retire the 870 mediumterm note and 1404 million in june to retire the 630 notes 



 

debt 

certain debt measures as of december 31 are outlined below 

  



  

  



  

our longterm debt is unsecured and essentially all such debt agreements contain customary investmentgrade type covenants that primarily limit the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing the outstanding debt our debt may be redeemed prior to maturity at the greater of par value and the makewhole value plus accrued and unpaid interest 

there were no material scheduled debt payments during 2014 however we purchased 5064 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer in march 2014 as described in note 6 “debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” this debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area 

a s of december 31 2014 current maturities for the next four quarters an d m aturities for the next five years are due as follows 

  



  

we expect to retir e d ebt m aturities using existing cash cash generated from operations  by drawing on our bank line of cred it o r accessing the capital markets 

in march 2014 w e a mended our 5000 million line of credit to among other items extend the term from march 2018 to march 2019 the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and inventory but will become unsecured upon the achievement of certain credit metrics andor credit ratings the line of credit also contain s n egative and financial covenants customary for a secured facility 



 

the negative covenants primarily limit our ability to 1 incur secured debt 2 make certain investments 3 execute acquisitions and divestitures and 4 make restricted payments including dividends such limitations currently do not impact our ability to execute our strategic operating and financial plans and becom e less restrictive when the line of credit becomes unsecured as described above 

the line of credit contains two financial covenants 1 a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda that declines over time to 351 and 2 a minimum ratio of ebitda to net cash interest expense that increases over time to 301 

as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all of our longterm debt and line of credit covenants 

as of december 31 2014 our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was  4465 million utilization of the   borrowing capacity was as follows  





borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from 150  t o 225   or an alternative rate derived from the lender’s prime rate based on our ratio o f de bt to ebitda   standby l etters of credit issued under the line of credit reduce availability and are charged a fee equal to the margin for libor based borrowings plus 0175   as of december 31 201 4  the applicable margin was 150  we also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit this commitment fee ranges from 025  to 040  based on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december 31 2014 the commitment fee was 025 once the line of credit becomes unsecured both the libor margin range for borrowings and the commitment fee range will decline 

debt ratings 

our debt rating s and outlook s as of december 31 201 4 a re summarized below 



  



  

equity 

our common stock issuances are summarized below 

  



  

during 2014 we issued 7150 thousand shares of our common stock in connection with business acquisition s a s explained in note 19  acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial st atements and supplementary data  



 

we occasionally sell shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k retirement plan s to satisfy the plan participants elections to invest in our common stock under this arrangement the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the years ended december 31 were 







there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2014 201 3 and 201 2  there were   3411416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors as of december 31 201 4  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material eff ect on our 







standby letters of credit 

for a discussion of our standb y letters of credit see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial sta tements and supplementary data 



 

cash contractual obligations 

we expect cash requirements for income taxes to be  803 million during 201 5 we expect capital spending of  250 million during 2015  additionally we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings these contracts are discrete and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event excluding f uture cash requirements for income taxes and capital expenditures and these immaterial contracts our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 201 4 are summarized in the table below 

  



  



critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 



 

we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 















1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 201 4  goodwill represents 38  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment 

h ow we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for imp airment one level below our operating segments reporting unit w e have identified 19 reporting units of which 9   carry goodwil l we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a twostep quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  





step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair valu e representing implied goodwill 



how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting uni ts   using bo th an income approach  which involves discounting estimated future cash flows  and a market approach    which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies   w e consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models finally to access the reasonableness of the fair values derived from these valuations we compare the implied fair values to our market capitalization 



 

o ur assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ from those estimates changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 201 4  net p roperty plant  equipment represents 38  of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 9  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judg ment th e carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg a sphalt mix and readymixed concrete the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates determines the profitability of the downstream business 



 

during 201 4  we recorded a  31 million loss on impairment of longlived assets related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area  see note 19 acquisitions and divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   we recorded no asset impairments during 2013   during 2012 we recorded a 20 million loss on impairment of longlived assets this impairment loss related primarily to assets classified as held for sale  

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations these assets totaled  3764   million at december 31 201 4  representing an approximate 8    in crease from december 31 201 3  of the total    3764 million  approximately 40  relates to re al estate held for future development and expansion of o ur op erations in addition  approximately   2 5  is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 3 5  is composed of aggregates a sphalt mix and r eadymix ed concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products we anticipate moving   idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 property plant  equipment and note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

3 reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations   2266 million as of december 31 2014 and  2282 million as of december 31 201 3  

how we determine fair value of the obligation 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

w e evaluat e c urrent facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 asset retirement obligations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 









how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds at december 31 201 4  the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 350  to 430  december 31 201 3 ranged from 380  to 515  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 201 4  the expected return on plan assets remained at 750   

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience and future expectations at december 31 201 4  our projected weightedaverage rate of compensation   increase was 370 up from 350 at december 31 2013  

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 201 4  our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits remained at 750  for 201 4  decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 20 25 and remaining level thereafter   i ncrease s in the per capita cost after 2015 are not expected to increase our obligations related to postretirement medical benefits as a result of a   2012 plan amendment   to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

  



  



 

as of the december 31 201 4 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets in creased from  7566 million to  8170   million du e t o favorable investment returns  no   contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 201 4  

during 201 5  we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately  165 million and net periodic postretirement expens e   of approximately  10 million compared to  92 million and   25  million respectively in 201 4  the in crease in pension expense is primarily due to the nearly 08 percentage point  80 basis point s  drop in discount rates and the adoption of the new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries on october 27 2014 we do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 201 5   and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 benefit plans in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

5 environmental compliance 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs   our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs  we 







at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur  but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study  when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 201 4  the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was  30 million   our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts h owever   a number of factors including adverse agency rulings an d u nanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 accrued environmental remediation costs in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program  we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to  20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to  30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

our accounting policy for claims and litigation including selfinsurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

how we determine our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met hod sign ificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay  these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement ’s carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes  deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns  realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

while we believe that the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforwards require additional consideration based on the following reasons 







based on this analysis we have provided a valuation allowance of  569 million  an increase of  106 million from the prior year valuation allowance against our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforward s o f the  569 million valuation allowance  555 million relate s to our alabama net operating los s c arryforward the remaining valuation allowance of  14 million relate s to other state net operating los s c arryforwa rds 

i f we later determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance will be reduc ed con versely if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets we will increase the valuation allo wance 



 

foreign earnings 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore at least annually we e valuate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore  

liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

we recognize a ta x benefit associated with a t ax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position  for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold w e m easure th e t ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realiz ed a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position ou r liability for u nrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments a nd new or emerging legislation 

the   years open   to   tax examinations vary by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is appropriate  

we consider a   tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination    or the expiration of the statute of limitati ons upon resolution of a tax position an y liability for u nrecognized tax benefits will be released 

ou r liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties associated with our   liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits as income tax expense 

statutory depletion 

our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

at december 31 201 4  the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was  22748 million compared to a book value of  20056 million the estimated fair value was determined by averaging the asking price quotes for the notes  the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by  1051 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this a nnual r eport

controls and procedures 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d    1 5e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 201 4  based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

as part of the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area we entered into a transition service s agreement with the buyer whereby we agreed to continue to provide certain services for the divested facilitie s d uring 2014 all services   were   performed   utilizing our existing systems and under our current control environment the service agreement d id not require significant changes to our current control environment beyond ensuring proper segregation of duties ove r p rocessing of thirdparty transactions controls were established and implemented to facilitate proper handling o f t hirdparty data including controls to protect against comingling of information and controls to prevent improper access to information   procedures put in place to facilitate the transition services agreement did not materially impact our controls over financial reporting during 2014 

on november 1 2014 we completed our obligations under the transition services agreement for the sold concrete facilities and the buyer began processing the transactions for the newly acquired concrete facilities in their systems we provided information support for the buyer’s concrete operations through december 31 2014 a new transition services agreement was put in place for cement operations through march 31 2015 

no other changes were made d uring the fourth quarter of 201 4   to our internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that could materially affect these controls 

management s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

under managements supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 201 4

report of independent registered public accounting firm – internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the company as of december 31 201 4 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 201 4 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 201 4 and our report dated february 26  201 5 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 

business 

  

vulcan materials company is a new jersey corporation and the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone san d and gravel we operated   342 a ggregates facilities during 2013  we also are a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in florida    

vulcan’s value proposition 

we are t he leading construction materials business in the country with superior aggregates operations our leading position is based upon 







strategy for existing and new markets   





 

source moody’s analytics as of november 21 2013 

  





competitors 

we operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggrega tes producers account ed for approximately   25  to 30  of to tal us aggregates production   in 2013  despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than   10  o ther publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 















because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5000 companies managing almost 9000 operations during 2013  many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or by extending   their existing market positions   



 

business strategy 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the us economy our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and a irports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches schools shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy the following graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to sales 

aggregatesled value creation — 2013 net sales 

represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates 

our business strategies include 1 aggregates focus 2 coasttocoast footprint 3 profitable growth 4 tightly managed operational and overhead costs and 5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio n a nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist our focus on aggregates allows us to  







 

2 large and strategically located coasttocoast 

demand for construction aggregates   correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in us metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly in 2013 we divested nons trategic assets in wisconsin  increased our presence in fastgrowing markets in georgia  texas   and virginia considerably improved our reserve position in california and commenced development of a major quarry in california  

the following graphic illustrates our projected percentage share of the growth by key demographics   for the united states  

source moody’s analytics as of november 21 2013 

  



 

3 profitable growth 

our longterm growth is a result of strategic acquisition s a nd investments in key operations  



in addition to these large acquisitions we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth 



4 tightly managed operational and overhead costs 

w e focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycl e sm all savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions we are able to adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions without jeopardizing our ability to take advanta ge of future increased demand 

  

our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively during the prolonged recession in the construction industry    in 2012 we initiated a profit enhancement plan that focused on improving profitability through more effective sourcing   reducing general  administrative expenses and improving transportationlogistics   programs  w e also reorganized our company structure in 2012 enabling us to make significant reductions in our selling administrative and general  sag  expense   in addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years in 201 3 we continued to control costs aggressively in our operation s   as a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing  our cash gross profit for each ton of aggregates sold in 201 3 was   33  higher than at the peak of demand in 2005   refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for nongaap disclosures    

  

  



 

5 la nd management 

we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future 

product lines 

we have four operating and reportable segments organized around our principal product lines 









1 aggregates 

a number of factors affect the us aggregates industry and our busines s i ncluding markets the location and quality of reserves and demand cycles 









  



 

i n addition the following factors influence the aggregates market 













  

aggregates markets 

we focus on the us markets with aboveaverage longterm expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail barge or ship to a particular end market  we serve both the public and the private sectors 



 

public sector   construction 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2013  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 52  of our total aggregates shipments 





map21 maintains essentially level f unding through fiscal year 201 4 w ith approximately 105 billion of total funding it extends the highway trust fund and tax collections through fiscal year 2016 adding additional stability to the federal highway program the   act’s substantial highway provisions are more reformfocused than previous bills with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects  funding directly for highways has provided a floor of 82 billion for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 in addition   map21 provides a significant increase in funding for the transportation infrastructure finance  innovation act tifia program funding for this program will increase to 175 billion over the twoyear period of this   act from 122 million per year under the previous multiyear highway bill tifia funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10 the us department of transportation estimates this tifia funding will support 30 to 50 billion in new construction however given administrative requirements and other factors it is   difficult to predict the timing of shipments for tifia projects  

tifia is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the united states including large portions of our footpri nt the program provides lowcost credit assistance in the form of secured loans loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects for up to 49 of a project’s estimated cost repayment terms are generous and at favorable interest rates eligible sponsors for tifia projects include state and local governments private firms special authorities and transportation improvement districts eligible projects include highways and bridges large multimodal projects as well as freight transfer and transit facilities we are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of tifiafunded projects 

overall map21 creates a positive framework for future authorizations through its significant reforms consolidating and simplifying federal highway programs accelerating the project delivery process expanding project financing and promoting publicprivate partnership opportunities the fact that congress was able to pass the bill given the political climate in washington maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what was expected has its own significance and has contributed to our optimism about the ability of congress to continue to work towards longterm solutions that will rebuild america’s infrastructure   

water infrastructure    congress is currently working to complete the water resources development act wrda which will provide legal authority for the us army corps of engineers to proceed with major planned improvements on hundreds of navigation flood control and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers canals ports and inland waterways throughout the nation in 2013 the us house of representatives and the senate both passed versions of the bill with sweeping majorities negotiators from each chamber are currently working to produce a conference report that could pass both chambers and go to the president for his signature we along with our business allies have been strong supporters of the wrda bill given its overall importance to the us economy and the pressing 



 

need to make material improvements to america’s harbors ports and inland waterways which are extensively used by us and our customers the final bill is expected to address a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects help enable improved dredging at certain ports and speed up permitting in order to improve the pace of project completion many of the large southern ports that would benefit from wrda as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes with the expansion of the panama canal lie within our footprint additionally both the house and senate bills introduce new innovative publicprivate financing opportunities the senates proposal is modeled after the highway programs tifia program and is called wifia water infrastructure financing and innovation act it seeks to fund large projects exceeding 25 million that are otherwise unachievable further as with tifia it provides funding for up to 49 of a projects estimated cost involves low interest rates and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the governments interest in order to encourage other investors 

  

  

private sector   construction 

the private sector   construction market s i nclude both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are   considerably more cyclical than public construction in 201 3  privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 48  of our total aggregates shipments 



c ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggrega tes af ter bottoming in 2010 trailing twelvemonth contract awards for private nonresidential buildings began to improve in 2011 ending the year up 16 from 2010 levels in 2012 private nonresidential building awards grew another 14 which was entirely attributable to strength in contract awards for stores and office buildings up 34 and 17 respectively  in 2013 contract awards as measured in square feet increased for the third year in a row total private nonresidential contract awards were up approximately 5 million square feet or 11 stores and office buildings again accounted for all of this growth up 19 and 20 respectively employment gro wth att ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market 



us housing starts as measured by mcgrawhill data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 600000 units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually in 2013 total annual housing starts increased to 951000 unit s the growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as balla st fo r construction and maintenance of railroad track s  we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15  segment reporting    in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  



 

  

our competitive advantages 

the competitive advantages of our aggregates focused strategy include 

coasttocoast footprint 













profitable growth 







strategically located assets 







2 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california florida georgia maryland texas virginia and the district of columbia and the bahamas  additionally we produce and sell in a limited number of these markets other concrete products such as block  we also resell purchased building materials for use with readymixed concrete and concrete block 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 78 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

ready mixed concrete production also requires cement in the   florida   market cement requirements for readymixed concrete production were   mostly supplie d b y our cement segment in other markets we purchase cement from third party suppliers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

in januar y 2 014 we entered into an agreement to sell our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area to cementos argos the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 for additional details see note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

3 asphalt mix 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california and texas  this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product  we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt m ix segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement  which we purchas e fr om thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt m ix segment customers from our local production facilities 

4 cement 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry our tampa florida distribution facility can import and export cement and slag cement can be resold blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form the cement segment’s largest single customer is our own readymixed concrete operations within the concrete segment 

ou r brooksville florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics water treatment and joint compound industries this facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

an expansion of production capacity at our newberry florida cement plant was completed in 2010 total annual production capacity is 16   million tons per year this plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility as of december 31 2013 t hese limestone reserves total ed   1886   milli on tons 

in januar y 2 014 we entered into an agreement to sell our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area to cementos argos we will retain our cement segment’s calcium operation in brooksville the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 for additional details see note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

other business  related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart er fu rthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 



 

customers 

no material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business in 201 3  ou r f ive largest customers accounted for 48  of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 11    of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45 to 55   of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and saf ety   examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both mine safety and health administration  msha  and occupational safety and health administration  osha compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201 4 and 201 5 will be approximately  106   million and  227 million respectively  these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 item 1a   

risk factors 

  

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

ec onomicpolitical risks 

b oth commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall us economy which   is recovering at a slow pace — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the   us economy is recovering from the recession but the pace of recovery is slow since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles construction projects have not returned to their pre recession levels 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capit al an d operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax  among other provisions the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule referred to as the tailoring rule   which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act we have determined that our newber r y cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time the first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the newberry cement plant w as submitted to the epa on march 31 2011 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate chang e l egislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 



 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs   — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrate d therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volum es in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our earnings in the future — construc  tion aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry si tes often take years to develop  therefore  our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results w ill depend i n part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

financialaccounting risks 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates our profits and profit margins are   negatively affected by significant decreases in volume 

uneve n r ecovery in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill   —   we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 20 1 3 tha t indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value the timing of a sustained recovery in the construction industry may have a significant effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill 

we incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger this additional debt significantly increased our interest expense and debt service requirements   —   the combination of this debt and our reduced operating cash flow over the last several years produced substantially higher financial leverage that has resulted in credit rating downgrades   

our operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest and in some years principal payments our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments or to refinance the maturing principal of debt depends on our operating and financial performance the ability to refinance maturing principal is also dependent upon the state of the capital markets operating and financial performance is in turn subject to general economic and business conditions many of which are beyond our control  

our debt instruments contain various reporting and financial covenants as well as affirmative covenants eg requirement to maintain proper insurance and negative covenants eg restrictions on lines of business if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing could be impaired 



 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in critical accounting policies under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use significant judgment in accounting for  















we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

personnel risks 

our business depends on a successful succession plan —   as a number of our longserving top executives approach retirement age effective succession planning has become very important to our longterm success the governance and management succession committee of o ur board of directors as well as the full board routinely reviews and updates the companys management succession plan   in december 2013 we announced several leadership changes effective january 1 2014 in furtherance of our management succession plan failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution additionally this change in management may be disruptive to our business and during the transition period there may be uncertai nty among investors vendors customers and others concerning our future direction and performance 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations   — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

other risks 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the c osts of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 



 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals and metals business es  although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty   —   we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal primarily in connection with our divested chemicals and metals businesses as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve mark ets in 18 sta tes the district of columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

our current estimate of 150   billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserve s i s consistent with the prior year’s level  estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 



 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation  

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 150   billion tons of estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves reported at the end of 201 3   and 2012 i nclude reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites the table below presents by region  the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 201 3 and the types of facilities operated   

  



  



  

of the 150 billion tons of aggregates reserves at december 31 2013  86 billion tons or 57  are located on owned land and 64 billion tons or 43  are located on leased land 



 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributed more than 5  to our net sales in 2013 



asphalt mix co nc rete and cement 

we also operate a number of facilities producing other products in several of our regions 

  



  



  

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our cement segment operates a limestone quarr y in newberry florida which provide s our cement production facility with feedstock materials   and a quarry at brooksville florida which provides feedstock for the ground calcium operation  

  



  

our newberry limestone quarry is mined primarily as feedstock for our whollyowned cement production facility the p rocess of making cement requires raw materials including high purity limestone to ac hieve the chemical reactions that generate the final prod uct the newberry limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 970 

our brooksville limestone quarry is mined and processed primarily as a supplement for enduse products such as animal feed plastics and paint high purity limestone is inert and relatively inexpensive compared to the other components used in these enduse produc ts the brooksville limestone quarry has an average calcium carbonate caco 3  content of 981 

  



 

headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods thereafter and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is 34 million 

  




 item 3 

legal proceedings 

  

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels 

see note 12  commitments and contingencies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of our material legal proceedings

earnings growth initiatives 

in february 2012 our board of directors approved a twopart initiative to accelerate earnings and cash flow growth  improve our operating leverage reduce overhead costs and strengthen our credit profile 





2013 strategic acquisitions 







market developments 

we believe economic and constructionrelated fundamentals that drive demand for our products are continuing to improve from the historically low levels created by the economic downturn growth in the private construction end markets particularly residential continued to drive increased construction activity and demand for our products in 2013 we have seen significant growth in housing starts in vulcanserved states such as arizona california florida georgia and texas additionally leading indicators of private nonresidential construction are continuing to improve 

highway construction is the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction recent growth in highway construction provides evidence that a more stable and predictable highway funding environment leads to improving construction activity future demand should also be positively impacted by the large increase in transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act tifia funding contained in the federal highway bill   map21 

  



 

unsolicited exchange offer 

in december 2011 martin marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common sto ck aft er careful consideration including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors our board unanimously determined that martin marietta’s offer wa s inadequate substantially undervalu ed vulcan had substantial execution risk and therefore wa s not in the best interests of vulcan and its shareholder s 

in may 2012 the delaware chancery court ruled and the delaware supreme court affirmed that martin marietta had breached two confidentiality agreements between the companies and enjoined martin marietta for a period of four months from pursuing its exchange offer for our shares prosecuting its proxy contest or otherwise taking steps to acquire control of our shares or assets and from any further violations of the two confidentiality agreements between the parties as a result of the court ruling martin marietta withdrew its exchange offer and its board nominees 

in response to martin marietta’s action we incurred legal professional and other costs of  434 million in 2012 and  22 million in 2011 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

generally accepted accounting principles gaap does not define free cash flow     cash gross profit and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ” ebitda thus free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measure defined by gaap  likewise cash gross profit and ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by gaap  we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyse s a nd for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a companys ability to incur and service debt and to assess the operating performance of a company’s businesses  we use free cash flow cash gross profit ebitda and other such measures to assess liquidity and the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company additionally we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period and provide the earnings per share impact of these adjustments for the convenience of the investment community we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources  reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below

the following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including ebitda and adjusted ebitda  

consolidated operating result   highlights 

  



  

operating leverage in our business 

the strong recovery in 2013s gross profit demonstrates the operating leverage in our business as demand recovers we expect this momentum to continue in 2014 due primarily to an improving demand environment continued improvement in pricing and our continued focus on managing costs we remain committed to building leading aggregates positions in markets with above average longterm demand growth as we look ahead to 2014 the operating leverage in our aggregates business sets the stage for even stronger earnings growth and cash generation as volumes continue to grow 

we completed several transactions in 201 3 that provided  2072 million in gross cash proceeds  a n d in january 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for gross cash proceeds of 7200 million for details of these 2013 and 2014 transactions refer to note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” and note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” respectively w e remain committed to completing transactions designed to strengthen our balance sheet unlock capital for more productive uses improve our operating results and create value for shareholders 



 

net earnings for 201 3 wer e  244 million or 019 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 526 million or 041 per diluted share in 2012 earnings improved partially as a result of volume growth in each of our operating segments our disciplined approach to pricing and effective cost control also positively impacted earnings additionally each years results were impacted by discrete items as follows 







yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 

  



  

operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four operating and report able segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 concrete 3 asphalt mix and 4 cement management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments  







in 2013 our a ggregates volume increased for the first time since the prior peak level of shipments in 2005  several key states including arizona california florida north carolina and texas reported strong volume growth versus the prior year   



 

our yearover year freight adjusted selling price   for aggregates  







virtually all of our markets realized pricing improvements in 2013 



  



  

aggregates segment gross profit increased 612 million from the prior year and gross profit margin as a percentage of segment revenues increased 14 percentage points 140 basis points the increase in aggregates segment gross profit resulted from higher volumes and higher selling prices slightly offset by marginally higher costs over 90  of the improvement in aggregates gross profit occurred in the second half of the year this demonstrates the continued optimism we have for the positive impact of operating leverage in the aggregates business   

aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 4 to  437 in 2013 this measure continues to improve  reflecting the cumulative effect of our costcontrol efforts and disciplined approach to pricing during the downturn these efforts resulted in a level of unit pr ofitability that exceeds the level achieved in 2005 our peak year for volume    further highlighting the earnings potential of our aggregates business 



 

2 concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 







the concrete segment reported a loss of 248 million in 2013 compared to a loss of 382 million in 2012 readymix concrete shipments were up 14  b enefiting from increased private construction activit y a nd the average sales price increased 1 over the prior year   volume growth was especially high in states with lower average sales price thereby lowering our average sales price price increases in florida georgia and texas exceeded 4 



3 asphalt mix 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 







asphalt mix segment gross profit of 327 million was up 98 million from the prior year the increase in asphalt mix segment gross profit resulted from higher shipments and lower costs slightly offset by lower selling prices a sphalt mix shipments increased 3  while the average sales price decreased 1 from the prior year materials margin increased 10  from the prior year benefiting from lower liquid asphalt prices 





 

4 cement 

cement segment gross profit of 5 7 million was up 85 million from the prior year cement shipments increased 14 and the averages sales price increased 7 over the prior year 



selling administrative and general expenses 

in millions 

  

  

sag expenses were in line with the prior year in 2012 we consolidated our eight divisions into four regions as part of an ongoing effort to reduce overhead costs additionally we initiated a profit enhancement plan that further leveraged our streamlined management structure and completed erp and shared services platforms these actions allowed us to achieve cost reductions and reduce overhead and administrative staff sag expenses have remained in line as we continue to leverage our overhead structure with the economic recovery 

our comparative total company employment levels at year end 







severance charges included in sag expenses were as follows 201 3 —  12 million   201 2 —  09 million and 2011 — 41 million    severance and other related restructuring charges not included in sag expenses were as follows 201 3 —  15 million  2012 — 96 million and 2011 — 130 million

our income tax benefit from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

  



  

the  420 million de crease in our 2013 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our results from continuing operations the 120 million decrease in our 2012 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the yearoveryear improvement in our results from continuing operation s a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 201 3  201 2 and 20 11 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

discontinued operations 

pretax earnings from discontinued operations were 







the 2013 and 2012 pretax earnings includ e g ains related primarily to the 5cp earnout of  117 and 10 2 million  respectively  the 2011 pretax earnings includ e g ains totaling 186 million related to the 5cp earnout and insurance recoveries these gains were partially offset by general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5cp earnout see note 2 discontinued operations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets additional sources of liquidity include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these liquidity and financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements including 











we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 













 

cash 

included in our december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents balance of  1937 million is  723 million of cash held at on e of our foreign subsidiaries  th e m ajority of this  723 million of cash relates to earnings prior to january 1 2012 that are permanently reinvested offshore use of this permanently reinvested cash is currently limited to our foreign operations 

cash from operating activities 

in millions 

  

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

  



  

  

2013 versus 2012 — net cash provided by operating activities of  3565 million in creased  1180 million from 2012 due primarily to a 795 million increase in proceeds from the sale of future production in september 2013 we entered into a second transaction to sell a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of  1531 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” additionally as noted in the table above net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization in creased  521 million in 2013 compared with 2012 

2012 versus 2011 — net cash provided by operating activities of 2385 million increased 695 million from 2011 due primarily to proceeds from the sale of future production  in december 2012 we entered into a transaction to sell a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves   resulting in   net cash proceeds of 736 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



 

cash from investing activities 

in millions 

  

2013 versus 2012 — net cash used for investing activities in creased  3066 million in 201 3  this in crease resulted from   a 2720 million increase in the purchase of property plant  equipment and businesses and a 328 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses during 2013 we acquired three aggregates production facilities and four readymixed concrete facilities for approximately 900 million   and land containing 136 million tons of reserves for 1170 million  we also sold five aggregates production facilities one replacement reserve site and reclaimed land associated with a former site of a readymixed concrete facility for approximately 511 million these transactions are consistent with our strategic focus on disposing noncore assets and building aggregates positions in markets with above average longterm demand growth 

2012 versus 2011 — net cash provided by investing activities increased 299 million in 2012 this increase resulted from an increase in proceeds from divestitures of noncore assets a 136 million yearoveryear increase in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and businesses and a decrease in spending for acquisitions a 161 million yearoveryear decrease in purchases of property plant  equipment and businesses these divestitures as outlined in note 19 acquisition and divestitures in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data are consistent with our strategic focus on disposing noncore assets and building leading aggregates positions in markets with above average longterm demand growth 

cash from financing activities 

in millions 

  

2013 versus 2012 — net cash used for financing activities of 1420 million in creased  128 million in 2013 compared to 2012 this increase in cash used for financing activities is attributable to a 15 8 million increase in de bt payments during 2013 we made scheduled debt payments of 100 million in january to retire the 870 mediumterm note and 1404 million in june to retire the 630 notes 

2012 versus 2011 — net cash used for financing activities increased 879 million in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2011 we restructured our debt portfolio which generated 248 million of net cash proceeds in 2012 we paid 1348 million of debt as scheduled this decrease in cash flows related to debt was partially offset by 930 million in cash savings derived from the decrease in dividend payments 2012 — 004 per share 2011 — 076 per share

in january 2014 we initiated a tender offer to purchase 5000 million of outstanding debt as disclosed in note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we expect to retir e remaining d ebt m aturities using existing cash cash generated from operations  by drawing on our bank line of cred it o r accessing the capital markets 

in march 2013 w e a mended our bank line of credit to extend its term from december 15 2016 to march 12 2018 and to reduce its capacity from 6000 million to 5000 million the line of credit is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory borrowing capacity fluctuates with the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and may be less than 5000 million at any point in time as of december 31 2013 our eligible borrowing capacity was  4360 million and our available borrowing capacity was 3826 million 

utilization of the eligible borrowing capacity under the line of credit as of december 31 201 3  





borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the lower of the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from 150  t o 2 00  based on the level of utilizatio n o r an 



 

alternative rate derived from the lender’s prime rat e l etters of credit issued under the line of credit are charged a fee equal to the applicable margin for borrowings as of december 31 201 3  the applicable margin was 175 

the line of credit contains limitations on liens indebtedness guarantee s acq uisitions and divestitures    and certain restricted payments  restricted payments include dividends to our shareholders there is no dollar limit or percent of retained earnings limit on restricted payments however we must have cash and borrowing capacity after the restricted payment is made of at least 1 50 0 million or 1 05 0 million if our fixed charge coverage ratio is above 100100 the minimum f ixed charge coverage rati o i s applicable only if usage exceeds 90 of the lesser of  5 00 0 million and the borrowing capacity derived from the sum of eligible accounts receivable and inventory

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 















1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 201 3  goodwill represents 37  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment 

h ow we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for imp airment one level below our operating segments reporting unit w e have identified 17 reporting units of which 9 carry goodwil l we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a twostep quantitative test we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  





step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair valu e representing implied goodwill 





 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies  finally we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization 

o ur assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ from those estimates changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 







the key assumptions used in our 2011 discounted cash flows dcf model of the aggregates reporting unit for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8 were growth rates for volume price and variable costs to produce capital requirements and the discount rate based on our historical experience and macroeconomic forecasts for each of the counties that are served by our operations we developed projections for volume price and cost growth rates subsequently projections were revised downwards to reflect assumptions that we believe a market participant not privy to our internal information would make based on information available through normal and customary due diligence procedures accordingly the dcf model assumes that over a twenty year projection period volumes pricing and variable cost grow at inflationadjusted real average annual rates of 48 09 and 07 respectively our capital spending assumptions are based on the level of projected volume and our historical experience for goodwill impairment testing purposes we utilized a 950 discount rate to present value the estimated future cash flows 

the market approach was based on multiples of revenue and ebitda to enterprise value for comparative public companies the six data points derived from the revenue and ebitda multiples for the past three years trailing twelve months and analysts’ estimates for next year were averaged to arrive at the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

for additional information regarding goodwill see note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements a nd supplementary data 



 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 201 3  net p roperty plant  equipment represents 40  of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 8  of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judg ment th e carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg readymixed concrete and asphalt mix the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates and cement determines the profitability of the downstream business 

we recorded no asset impairments during 2013   during 2012 we recorded a 20 million loss on impairment of longlived assets this impairment loss related primarily to assets classified as held for sale see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ”   long lived asset impairments during 201 1 were immaterial   and related to property abandonments    

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations these assets totaled  3498   million at december 31 201 3  representing an approximate 5    in crease from december 31 201 2  of the total    3498 million  approximately 35  relates to re al estate held for future development and expansion of o ur op erations an additional 25  is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 40  is composed of aggregates readymix ed concrete and asphalt mix operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products of this remaining 40 of temporarily idled assets  156 million is composed of assets that we anticipate selling in the first quarter of 2014 see note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” we anticipate moving the remaining idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 property plant  equipment and note 18 goodwill and intangible assets in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

3 reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations  2282 million as of december 31 201 3 and 15 0  1 million as of december 31 201 2  



 

how we determine fair value of the obligation 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 asset retirement obligations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 









how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds at december 31 201 3  the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 380  to 515  december 31 201 2 ranged from 305  to 435  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 201 3  the expected return on plan assets remained at 750  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience and future expectations at december 31 201 3  our projected weightedaverage rate of compensation   increase remained at 350  

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 201 3  our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits remained at   750  for 201 4  decreasing each year until reaching 50 0  in 20 19 and remaining level thereafter 



 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

  



  

as of the december 31 201 3 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets in creased from 6 831 million to  7566 million du e t o favorable investment returns  no   contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 201 3  

during 201 4  we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately  73 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately  21 million compared to  371 million and  26 million respectively in 201 3  the de crease in pension expense is due in part to a plan change announced in march 2013 which ceased future accruals for salaried pension participants beyond 2013 we do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 201 4  however we anticipate making a 41 million discretionary contribution to the plans we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 benefit plans in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 



 

5 environmental compliance 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs  we 







at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 201 3  the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was  39 million 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 accrued environmental remediation costs in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program  we are selfinsured for losses related to workers compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 



 

7 income taxes 

how we determine our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability met hod sign ificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay  these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings our geographic mix of earnings legislative changes and other relevant items 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement ’s carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes  deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns  realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period 

each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

on an annual basis we perform a comprehensive analysis of all forms of positive and negative evidence based on year end results during each interim period we update our annual analysis for significant changes in the positive and negative evidence 

at december 31 201 3  we identified the following forms of negative evidence 







the amount of our definitelived deferred tax asset carryforwards at december 31 2013 along with their expiration periods  is listed below 



  

the first transaction described in note 21 “subsequent events” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” is significant new positive evidence and will provide sufficient taxable income to support the realization of 









the realization of the remaining balance of our deferred tax assets is supported by the future reversals of our existing temporary differences and the anticipated future earnings from our foreign operations 

based on the following reasons our state net operating loss carryforwards require additional consideration 









 

based on this analysis we have provided a valuation allowance of  463 million  an increase of 75 million from the prior year valuation allowance against our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforward s o f the  463 million valuation allowance  447 million relate s to our alabama net operating los s c arryforward the remaining valuation allowance of  16 million relate s to other state net operating los s c arryforwa rds 

i f we later determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance will be reduc ed con versely if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets we will increase the valuation allo wance 

foreign earnings 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore at least annually we e valuate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore  

unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

we recognize a ta x benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position  for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure th e t ax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realiz ed ou r liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits 

the   years open   to   tax examinations vary by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is adequate 

we consider an issue to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled” settlement of an examination    or the expiration of the statute of limitati ons upon resolution unrecognized tax benefits will be reversed as a discrete event 

ou r liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecogniz ed ta x benefits as income tax expense 

statutory depletion 

our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings 

new accounting standards

the foregoing discussion and analysis as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report contain  forwardlooking statements  within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i above 



 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

at december 31 201 3  the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was  28206 million compared to a book value of  25224 million the estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on creditadjusted interest rates on us treasury bills notes or bonds as appropriate the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by  1332 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this a nnual r eport

report of independent registered public accounting firm – internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the company as of december 31 201 3 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1   tableend business   

vulcan materials company is a new jersey corporation and the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel we have 341 active aggregates facilities we also are a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in florida 

vulcan’s value proposition 

we are the leading construction materials business in the country with superior aggregates operations our leading position is based upon 

 

  

  

  

 strategy for existing and new markets 

 

 us demographic growth 2010 to 2020 top 10 by state

 index to financial statements competitors 

we operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30 to 35 of the total us aggregates production despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with over 5000 companies managing almost 10000 operations many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or by enhancing their existing market positions 

  

 index to financial statements business strategy 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the us economy our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in all types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy the following graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to sales 

aggregatesled value creation — 2012 net sales 

 

 represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates 

our business strategies include 1 aggregates focus 2 coasttocoast footprint 3 profitable growth 4 tightly managed operational and overhead costs and 5 effective land management 

1 aggregates focus 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist our focus on aggregates allows us to 

 

  

   

 index to financial statements 2 coasttocoast footprint 

demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly 

 

3 profitable growth 

our growth is a result of acquisitions cost management and investment activities 

 

 in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc the largest acquisition in our history this acquisition expanded our aggregates business in florida and other southeastern and midatlantic states as well as adding to our readymixed concrete business and added cement manufacturing and distribution facilities in florida 

in addition to these large acquisitions we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth 

 

   

 index to financial statements 4 tightly managed operational and overhead costs 

in a business where aggregates sell on average for approximately 1000 per ton we are accustomed to rigorous cost management throughout economic cycles small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions we are able to adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions without jeopardizing our ability to take advantage of future increased demand 

our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively during the prolonged recession in addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years in 2012 we continued to control costs aggressively in our operations which improved our perton margins as a result our cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in 2012 was 27 higher than at the peak of demand in 2005 refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for nongaap disclosures in 2012 we also reorganized our company structure enabling us to make significant reductions in our selling administrative and general sag expense 

 

5 effective land management 

we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future 

  

 index to financial statements product lines 

we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines 

 

  

  

  

 1 aggregates 

 

a number of factors affect the us aggregates industry and our business including markets reserves and demand cycles 

 

  

  

   

 index to financial statements  however there are signs the current cyclical downturn is drawing to a close and a recovery in private construction is taking hold residential construction as measured by housing starts has bottomed out and a sustained recovery appears to be underway since october 2011 yearoveryear growth in trailing twelve month housing starts has been increasing this is significant because housing contributes to gross domestic product gdp in two basic ways through fixed investment and through consumption spending and housing services residential investment which includes construction of both new singlefamily and multifamily structures has the most direct impact on construction activity during the last four housing recoveries after economic downturns increased construction activity in other end markets has followed growth in housing starts 

the diagram below depicts how housing starts can have a direct and indirect impact on the overall economy and construction end markets housing starts lead to growth in demand for private investment as well as initial and ongoing sources of tax revenue both of which drive increased construction activity historically housing has contributed 17 to 18 of gdp according to the national association of home builders 

 

in addition the following factors influence the aggregates market 

 

  

   

 index to financial statements   

  

  

   

 index to financial statements our markets 

we focus on the us markets with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or with access to economical transportation to their markets we serve both the public and the private sectors 

public sector 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2012 publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 54 of our total aggregates shipments 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 index to financial statements  private sector 

the private sector markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and is considerably more cyclical than public construction in 2012 privatelyfunded construction accounted for approximately 46 of our total aggregates shipments 

 

  

  

  

 index to financial statements   

  

additional aggregates products and markets 

we sell aggregates that are used as ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

our brooksville florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics water treatment and joint compound industries this facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 “segment reporting” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

 2 concrete 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in california florida georgia maryland texas virginia and the district of columbia additionally we produce and sell in a limited number of these markets other concrete products such as block we also resell purchased building materials for use with readymixed concrete and concrete block 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 78 by weight of this product we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

readymixed concrete production also requires cement in the florida market cement requirements for readymixed concrete production are supplied substantially by our cement segment in other markets we purchase cement from thirdparty suppliers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

  

 index to financial statements 3 asphalt mix 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california and texas this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt mix segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement which we purchase entirely from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate we serve our asphalt mix segment customers from our local production facilities 

4 cement 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry our tampa florida distribution facility can import and export cement and slag cement can be resold blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form 

the cement segment’s largest single customer is our own readymixed concrete operations within the concrete segment 

an expansion of production capacity at our newberry florida cement plant was completed in 2010 total annual production capacity is 16 million tons per year this plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility these limestone reserves total 1898 million tons 

other businessrelated items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter because of winter weather in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

customers 

no material part of our business is dependent upon any single customer whose loss would have an adverse effect on our business in 2012 our top five customers accounted for 56 of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 14 of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

  

 index to financial statements environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges waste management protection of wetlands listed and threatened species noise and dust exposure control for workers and safety regulations under both msha and ohsa compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2013 and 2014 will be approximately 114 million and 171 million respectively these anticipated expenditures are not expected to have any material impact on our earnings or competitive position 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

patents and trademarks 

we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments 

other information regarding vulcan 

vulcan is a new jersey corporation incorporated on february 14 2007 while its predecessor company was incorporated on september 27 1956 our principal sources of energy are electricity diesel fuel natural gas and coal we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments in 2013 

as of january 1 2013 we employed 6727 people in the us of these employees 613 are represented by labor unions as of that date outside of the us we employed 300 people in mexico and one in the bahamas 235 of whom are represented by a labor union we do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2013 

we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding our business

 item 1a tableend risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

financialaccounting risks 

continued slow economic recovery in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 2012 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value the timing of a sustained recovery in the construction industry may have a significant effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill that would reduce equity and result in an increase in our total debt as a percentage of total capital 416 as of december 31 2012 

we incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger this additional debt significantly increased our interest expense and debt service requirements — the combination of this debt and our reduced operating cash flow over the last several years produced substantially higher financial leverage that has resulted in credit rating downgrades 

our operating cash flow is burdened by substantial annual interest and in some years principal payments our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments or to refinance the maturing principal of debt depends on our operating and financial performance the ability to refinance maturing principal is also dependent upon the state of the capital markets operating and financial performance is in turn subject to general economic and business conditions many of which are beyond our control 

our debt instruments contain various reporting and financial covenants as well as affirmative covenants eg requirement to maintain proper insurance and negative covenants eg restrictions on lines of business if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing could be impaired 

our new regional alignment and restructuring of our accounting and certain administrative functions may not yield the anticipated efficiencies and may result in a loss of key personnel — in december 2011 we announced a major change in the structure of our business going from eight geographical divisions to four regions we have taken steps to consolidate the operations sales finance accounting human resources engineering and geologic services functions this consolidation is expected to reduce the cost of overhead support functions going forward the administrative efficiencies which we believe will result from the consolidation may not be realized to the extent anticipated thereby reducing the operating income benefit additionally key personnel may decide not to relocate and employees affected by the consolidation may leave us due to uncertainty prior to completing the transition efforts which may slow the restructuring process and increase its cost 

  

 index to financial statements our announced earnings growth initiatives including a profit enhancement plan and planned asset sales may not realize results to the desired degree or within the desired time period and therefore the results of these initiatives may differ materially from those anticipated — in february 2012 we announced a twopart initiative to accelerate earnings growth and improve our credit profile this initiative included a plan to reduce costs and other earnings enhancements for a 100 million earnings effect over the subsequent 18 months we also announced a plan to sell certain assets over 18 months ending july 2013 for net proceeds of 500 million these anticipated results are subject to a number of execution risks that could result in actual results that are much lower than the anticipated results additionally even if the results are achieved it could take longer than the announced timeframe before such results may be realized 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates both our dollar profits and our percentage of net sales margin could be negatively affected by decreases in volume 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

economicpolitical risks 

both commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall us economy which has been recovering at a slow pace — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall us economy has been adversely affected by the recent recession although the us economy is now in recovery the pace of recovery is slow since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles construction projects have not returned to their prerecession levels 

low housing starts and general weakness in the housing market could continue to negatively affect demand for our products — in most of our markets sales volumes have been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a significant decline from peak housing starts in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until residential construction sustains a significant recovery 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations 

  

 index to financial statements may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax among other provisions the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act we have determined that our newberry cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time the first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the newberry cement plant was submitted to the epa on march 31 2011 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change and legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are significantly vertically integrated therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows in certain markets vertically integrated competitors have acquired a portion of our asphalt mix and readymixed concrete customers and this trend may accelerate 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our earnings in the future — construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

  

 index to financial statements personnel risks 

our business depends on a successful succession plan — as a number of our longserving top executives approach retirement age effective succession planning has become very important to our longterm success the governance and management succession committee of our board of directors as well as the full board routinely reviews and updates the company’s management succession plan failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution additionally this change in management may be disruptive to our business and during the transition period there may be uncertainty among investors vendors customers and others concerning our future direction and performance 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings — the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise we could suffer an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other risks 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve markets in 19 states the district of columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

 

our current estimate of 150 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves is essentially unchanged from 2011 as acquisition of new reserves offset production and divestures during the year estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

  

 index to financial statements proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 150 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2012 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites we reported proven and probable reserves of 150 billion tons at the end of 2011 using the same basis the table below presents by region the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2012 and the types of facilities operated 

 

 1 in addition to the facilities included in the table above we operate 19 recrushed concrete plants which are not dependent on reserves 

2 includes 1265 million tons of proven and probable reserves encumbered by the volumetric production payment which includes an additional 167 million tons of possible reserves as defined in note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

of the 150 billion tons of aggregates reserves 85 billion tons or 57 are located on owned land and 65 billion tons or 43 are located on leased land

 market developments 

we believe economic and constructionrelated fundamentals that drive demand for our products are continuing to improve from the historically low levels created by the economic downturn the passage of the new federal highway bill in july 2012 is providing stability and predictability to future highway funding through the first three months of fiscal year 2013 ie october—december 2012 obligation of federal funds for future highway projects is up sharply versus the prior year a positive indicator of growth in future contract awards the large increase in tifia transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact demand going forward 

leading indicators of private construction activity specifically residential housing starts and contract awards for nonresidential buildings continue to improve consequently aggregates demand in private construction is growing we are seeing tangible evidence of this growth in several key states including florida texas california georgia and arizona growth in residential construction has historically been a leading indicator of other construction end uses 

unsolicited exchange offer 

in december 2011 martin marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 050 shares of martin marietta common stock for each vulcan common share and indicated its intention to nominate a slate of directors to our board after careful consideration including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors our board unanimously determined that martin marietta’s offer was inadequate substantially undervalued vulcan had substantial execution risk and therefore was not in the best interests of vulcan and its shareholders 

in may 2012 the delaware chancery court ruled and the delaware supreme court affirmed that martin marietta had breached two confidentiality agreements between the companies and enjoined martin marietta for a period of four months from pursuing its exchange offer for our shares prosecuting its proxy contest or otherwise taking steps to acquire control of our shares or assets and from any further violations of the two confidentiality agreements between the parties as a result of the court ruling martin marietta withdrew its exchange offer and its board nominees 

in response to martin marietta’s action we incurred legal professional and other costs of 434 million in 2012 and 22 million in 2011 

  

 index to financial statements reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

generally accepted accounting principles gaap does not define “free cash flow” “segment cash gross profit” and “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda thus free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measure defined by gaap likewise segment cash gross profit and ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by gaap we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company’s ability to incur and service debt we use free cash flow segment cash gross profit ebitda and other such measures to assess liquidity and the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company additionally we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period and provide the earnings per share impact of these adjustments for the convenience of the investment community we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below

consolidated operating results 

 

 operating leverage embedded in our business 

the strong recovery in 2012’s gross profit demonstrates the operating leverage embedded in our business as demand recovers we expect this momentum to continue in 2013 due primarily to an improving demand environment continued improvement in pricing and our continued focus on 

 

  

  

 since 2007 we have invested 635 million to implement our new erp and shared services platforms we initiated the project to create a common platform for all systems that support our business and have completed all of the major milestones for the project these platforms are helping to streamline processes enterprisewide and standardize administrative and support functions while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control costs 

these new platforms enabled us to consolidate our eight divisions into four regions streamline our support functions and reduce related positions and overhead costs — resulting in annualized overhead cost savings of over 55 million as a 

  

 index to financial statements result of these restructuring initiatives we incurred severance and other related charges of 100 million during 2012 and 130 million during 2011 

to position vulcan for significant earnings growth we remain focused on taking prudent steps to control costs when prudent we adjust our geographic footprint so as to focus on building leading aggregates positions in markets with aboveaverage longterm demand growth 

we completed several transactions in 2012 that provided 1736 million in gross cash proceeds and we continue to work on additional asset sales however the ultimate timing of such transactions is difficult to predict we remain committed to completing transactions designed to strengthen our balance sheet unlock capital for more productive uses improve our operating results and create value for shareholders 

results for 2012 were a net loss of 526 million or 041 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 708 million or 055 per diluted share in 2011 higher unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt resulted in higher pretax costs of 39 million and 107 million respectively additionally each year’s results were impacted by discrete items as follows 

 

  

  

 yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 

 

 operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 concrete 3 asphalt mix and 4 cement management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

  

 index to financial statements 1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments 

 

  

  

 several key states including florida and texas reported volume growth versus the prior year other markets in key states such as virginia north carolina and georgia were down modestly in 2012 shipments in california were relatively flat versus the prior year less largescale project work contributed to lower shipments in certain markets 

our yearoveryear freightadjusted selling price for aggregates 

 

  

  

 nearly all of our markets realized increased pricing in 2012 

 

  

   

 index to financial statements aggregates segment gross profit increased 459 million from the prior year and gross profit margin as a percentage of segment revenues increased 27 percentage points 270 basis points as shown on the chart on page 35 the increase in aggregates segment gross profit resulted from lower costs and higher selling prices slightly offset by lower shipments most key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics improved from the prior year more than offsetting a 3 increase in the unit cost of diesel fuel 

aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 5 to 421 in 2012 this measure continues to improve from a cyclical low in the third quarter of 2011 reflecting the cumulative effect of our costcontrol efforts and a disciplined approach to pricing during the downturn these efforts are establishing unit profitability higher than in 2005 which was a peak year for volume adding to the attractiveness of the earnings potential of our aggregates business 

2 concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 

 

  

  

 the concrete segment reported a loss of 382 million in 2012 compared to a loss of 434 million in 2011 readymixed concrete shipments were up 9 benefitting from increased private construction activity while the average sales price was essentially flat contributing to a 52 million improvement 

 

 3 asphalt mix 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 

 

  

  

 asphalt mix segment gross profit of 229 million was down 27 million from the prior year the average sales price for asphalt mix increased 1 from the prior year offsetting some of the earnings effect of the 7 decline in shipments the decline in shipments was due in part to less large project work in california in the second half of 2012 and the divestiture of our new mexico asphalt mix business in the fourth quarter of 2011 partially offset by a 15 increase in our asphalt mix shipments in texas materials margin remained steady despite lower volumes finishing the year 3 higher than the prior year 

  

 index to financial statements  4 cement 

the 17 million improvement in the cement segment’s profitability resulted from an 18 increase in shipments and a 6 increase in pricing 

 

 selling administrative and 

general expenses 

in millions 

 

sag expenses decreased 309 million or 11 from 2011 this 2012 decrease resulted from lower spending in most major overhead categories including savings from reduced employment levels in 2011 we substantially completed the implementation of a multiyear project to replace our legacy information technology systems with new erp and shared services platforms these platforms are helping us streamline processes enterprisewide and standardize administrative and support functions while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control costs during 2012 we consolidated our eight divisions into four regions as part of an ongoing effort to reduce overhead costs and we initiated a profit enhancement

interest expense 

in millions 

 

interest expense decreased 75 million from the 2011 level this comparative decline resulted primarily from the 272 million of charges incurred in 2011 in connection with our debt refinancing tender offer and debt retirement partially offset by the effects of a higher level of fixedrate debt stemming from the debt refinancing 

the 2011 increase in interest expense resulted primarily from our aforementioned debt refinancing completed in june in addition to higher effective interest rates on the new debt we incurred 272 million of charges in connection with our tender offer and debt retirement these charges resulted from the 184 million difference between the purchase price and par value of the notes purchased in the tender offer 07 million in transaction fees and 81 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized discounts deferred financing costs and amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the retired debt

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets additional sources of liquidity include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these liquidity and financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements including

included in our december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents balance of 2755 million is 529 million of cash held at one of our foreign subsidiaries the majority of this 529 million of cash relates to earnings prior to january 1 2012 that are permanently reinvested offshore 

cash from operating activities 

in millions 

 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

 

 2012 versus 2011 — net cash provided by operating activities of 2385 million increased 695 million from 2011 due primarily to proceeds from the sale of future production in december 2012 we unlocked capital in our east region through a volumetric production payment resulting in net cash proceeds of 736 million see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2011 versus 2010 — although net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization increased to 2909 million from 2856 million net cash provided by operating activities decreased 337 million operating cash flows were negatively impacted by changes in our working capital accounts which used 253 million in cash in 2011 compared to 372 million of cash generated in 2010 this increase in cash outflows was partially offset by a decrease in contributions to pension plans from 245 million in 2010 to 49 million in 2011 

  

 index to financial statements cash from investing activities 

in millions 

 

2012 versus 2011 — net cash provided by investing activities increased 299 million in 2012 this increase resulted from an increase in proceeds from divestitures of noncore assets a 136 million yearoveryear increase in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and businesses and a decrease in spending for acquisitions a 161 million yearoveryear decrease in purchases of property plant  equipment and businesses these divestitures as outlined in note 19 “acquisition and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” are consistent with our strategic focus on disposing noncore assets and building leading aggregates positions in markets with above average longterm demand growth 

2011 versus 2010 — net cash used for investing activities of 195 million decreased 689 million from 2010 proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic businesses increased 238 million yearoveryear to 747 million in 2011 we utilized an asset swap strategy to acquire aggregates facilities in high growth markets while disposing of nonstrategic assets this strategy allowed us to acquire net assets valued at 354 million for a cash outlay of 105 million accordingly cash used to acquire businesses decreased by 600 million compared to 2010 cash used for the purchase of property plant  equipment totaled 989 million in 2011 compared to 863 million in 2010 and 1097 million in 2009 

cash from financing activities 

in millions 

2012 versus 2011 — net cash used for financing activities increased 879 million in 2012 compared to 2011 in 2011 we restructured our debt portfolio which generated 248 million of net cash proceeds in 2012 we paid 1348 million of debt as scheduled this decrease in cash flows related to debt was partially offset by 930 million in cash savings derived from the decrease in dividend payments 2012 — 004 per share 2011 — 076 per share 

2011 versus 2010 — net cash used for financing activities of 413 million decreased 478 million from 2010 increases in financing cash flows were largely due to an increase in cash flows related to debt of 715 million this net positive cash flow variance includes proceeds and payments of shortterm and longterm debt debt issuance costs cash paid to purchase our own debt at a premium above par value and proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swap agreements the positive cash flows from debtrelated items and the 296 million decrease in dividends paid largely as a result of the dividend reduction in the fourth quarter of 2011 were partially offset by yearoveryear decreases in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options totaling 537 million

 critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

  

 index to financial statements we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

3 reclamation costs 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

5 environmental compliance 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

1 goodwill and 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2012 goodwill represents 38 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in december 2011 we announced an organizational restructuring plan that led to changes in the manner in which our operations are managed as a result we reorganized our reporting unit structure and reassigned goodwill among our revised reporting units using a relative fair value approach this reorganization led to an increase in reporting units from 13 to 19 of which 10 carry goodwill the reporting units are evaluated using a twostep process 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 

 

  

 step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill 

 

 how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies finally we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization 

  

 index to financial statements our assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ from those estimates changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 

 

  

  

 the key assumptions used in our 2011 discounted cash flows dcf model of the aggregates reporting unit for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8 were growth rates for volume price and variable costs to produce capital requirements and the discount rate based on our historical experience and macroeconomic forecasts for each of the counties that are served by our operations we developed projections for volume price and cost growth rates subsequently projections were revised downwards to reflect assumptions that we believe a market participant not privy to our internal information would make based on information available through normal and customary due diligence procedures accordingly the dcf model assumes that over a twenty year projection period volumes pricing and variable cost grow at inflationadjusted real average annual rates of 48 09 and 07 respectively our capital spending assumptions are based on the level of projected volume and our historical experience for goodwill impairment testing purposes we utilized a 950 discount rate to present value the estimated future cash flows 

the market approach was based on multiples of revenue and ebitda to enterprise value for comparative public companies the six data points derived from the revenue and ebitda multiples for the past three years trailing twelve months and analysts’ estimates for next year were averaged to arrive at the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

delays in a sustained recovery in our gulf coast markets may result in an impairment of this reporting unit’s goodwill 

for additional information regarding goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

 index to financial statements 2 impairment of longlived assets 

excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2012 net property plant  equipment represents 39 of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 9 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg readymixed concrete and asphalt mix the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates and cement determines the profitability of the downstream business 

during 2012 we recorded a 20 million loss on impairment of longlived assets this impairment loss related primarily to assets classified as held for sale see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” longlived asset impairments during 2011 were immaterial and related to property abandonments during 2010 we recorded a 39 million loss on impairment of longlived assets 

we maintain certain longlived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations these assets totaled approximately 325 million at december 31 2012 representing an approximate 5 increase from december 31 2011 of the total 325 million approximately 30 relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations an additional 25 is comprised of real estate principally former mining sites pending development as commercial or residential real estate reservoirs or landfills the remaining 45 is composed of aggregates readymix and asphalt mix operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products we anticipate moving these idled assets back into operation as demand recovers we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

3 reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations 1501 million as of december 31 2012 and 1540 million as of december 31 2011 

  

 index to financial statements how we determine fair value of the obligation 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 “asset retirement obligations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

4 pension and other 

postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 

 

  

  

  

 how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds at december 31 2012 the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 305 to 435 december 31 2011 ranged from 415 to 508 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2012 the expected return on plan assets was reduced to 75 from the 80 used to determine the 2012 expense 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience and future expectations at december 31 2012 our projected weightedaverage rate of compensation remained at 35 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 2012 our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was increased to 80 for 2013 decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 2019 and remaining level thereafter 

  

 index to financial statements changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

 

 

 as of the december 31 2012 measurement date the fair value of our pension plan assets increased from 6366 million to 6831 million due to investment gains no contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 2012 

during 2013 we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately 460 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately 45 million compared to 366 million and 102 million respectively in 2012 the increase in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in discount rates the decrease in other postretirement benefit expense is primarily the result of a plan change which caps the employer cost of medical coverage at the 2015 level we do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 2013 as a result of interest rate relief provided as part of the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century map21 act we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

 index to financial statements 5 environmental compliance 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs we 

 

  

  

 at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2012 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 39 million 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

6 claims and litigation 

including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

  

 index to financial statements 7 income taxes 

how we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities annually we compare the liabilities calculated for our federal state and foreign income tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of the year end income tax provision any adjustments are reflected in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement on a quarterly basis we assess all positive and negative evidence to determine the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income we take into account such factors as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would charge an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings conversely if we were to determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance would be reduced and we would record a benefit to earnings 

foreign earnings 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore we periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and accordingly whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 

unrecognized income tax benefits 

we recognize an income tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we consider appropriate 

before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized income tax benefit is audited and finally resolved a number of years may elapse the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is adequate favorable resolution of an unrecognized income tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our income tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized income tax benefit could increase the income tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

we consider an issue to be resolved at the earlier of settlement of an examination the expiration of the statute of limitations or when the issue is “effectively settled” our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is generally presented as 

  

 index to financial statements noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as income tax expense 

statutory depletion 

our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings

 item 7a tableend quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

at december 31 2012 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was 29174 million compared to a book value of 26770 million the estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on creditadjusted interest rates on us treasury bills notes or bonds as appropriate the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by 1496 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

disclosure controls 

and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d  15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2012 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

we are in the process of replacing our legacy information technology systems and have substantially completed the implementation of new financial reporting software which is a major component of the replacement we are also in the process of implementing a new quote to cash software system which is another significant component of the replacement the new information technology systems were a source for most of the information presented in this annual report on form 10k we are continuing to work toward the full implementation of the new information technology systems 

no other changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that could materially affect these controls during the fourth quarter of 2012 

management’s report on internal 

control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

under management’s supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the “company” as of december 31 2012 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 and our report dated february 28 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1a tableend risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

risks relating to the unsolicited exchange offer 

martin marietta’s unsolicited exchange offer and proxy contest may require us to incur significant additional costs and otherwise cause disruption to our business — on december 12 2011 martin marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 050 shares of martin marietta common stock for each vulcan common share and indicated its intention to nominate a slate of directors to our board after careful consideration including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors our board unanimously determined that martin marietta’s offer is inadequate substantially undervalues vulcan and is not in the best interests of vulcan and its shareholders 

in response to martin marietta’s actions we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial legal investment banking and other professional fees and may incur significant additional costs as well as experience a disruption to and distraction in our business and operations which could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally as a consequence of the uncertainty generated by martin marietta’s actions as to the future direction of our company our employees may pursue other employment opportunities or suffer from reduced morale and our ability to attract and retain key personnel and business partners and realize potential business opportunities may be harmed if key employees leave as a result of martin marietta’s actions or have their morale adversely affected or if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel and business partners or realize potential business opportunities our business and results of operations would be negatively affected 

moreover if a takeover were to be consummated and our company’s credit ratings were to be downgraded a changeincontrol under certain of our company’s indebtedness agreements may result and require some of our indebtedness to be repurchased or result in its acceleration 

in addition martin marietta’s actions including its unsolicited offer could cause our company’s stock price to fluctuate significantly 

financialaccounting risks 

continued slow economic recovery in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value while we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on november 1 2011 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value the timing of a sustained recovery in the construction industry may have a significant effect on the fair value of our reporting units a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material noncash writedown of goodwill that would reduce equity and 

  

 result in an increase in our total debt as a percentage of total capital 426 as of december 31 2011 the indenture governing our notes contains a covenant limiting our total debt as a percentage of total capital to 65 we believe that it is highly unlikely that any potential writedown in goodwill would result in a violation of this covenant 

we incurred additional debt to finance the florida rock merger which significantly increased our interest expense financial leverage and debt service requirements — we incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger this debt which significantly increased our leverage has been a significant factor in downgrades in our credit ratings 

our cash flow is reduced by payments of principal and interest on this debt our debt instruments contain various financial and contractual restrictions or covenants if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity an event of default under our debt instruments also could significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows — the current economic environment has negatively affected the us economy and demand for our products commercial and residential construction may continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations of capital projects 

a slow economic recovery also may increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on our accounts receivable from our customers we have experienced payment delays from some of our customers during this economic downturn 

the credit environment could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing and if available it may not be at economically favorable terms interest rates on new issuances of longterm public debt in the market may increase due to higher credit spreads and risk premiums there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at favorable interest rates which could negatively affect our financial results 

we may need to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or refinance our outstanding debt we also are exposed to risks from tightening credit markets especially in regard to access to debt and equity capital 

our new regional alignment and restructuring of our accounting and certain administrative functions may not yield the anticipated efficiencies and may result in a loss of key personnel — in december 2011 we announced a major change in the structure of our business going from eight geographical divisions to four regions we have taken steps to consolidate the operations sales finance human resources engineering and geologic services functions this consolidation is expected to reduce the cost of overhead support functions going forward however the cost of such consolidation which includes severance relocation and other costs could exceed our estimates the administrative efficiencies which we believe will result from the consolidation may not be realized to the extent anticipated thereby reducing the operating income benefit additionally key personnel may decide not to relocate and employees affected by the consolidation may leave us prior to completing the transition efforts which may slow the restructuring process and increase its cost 

our recently announced earnings growth initiatives including a profit enhancement plan and planned asset sales may not be able to be realized to the desired degree or within the desired time period and therefore the results of these initiative may differ materially from those anticipated — in february 2012 we announced a twopart initiative to accelerate earnings growth and improve our credit profile this initiative includes a plan to reduce costs and other earnings enhancements for a 100 million earnings effect over the next 18 months we also announced a plan to sell certain assets over the next 12 to 18 months for net aftertax proceeds of 500 million these anticipated results are subject to a number of execution risks that could result in actual results that are much lower than the anticipated results additionally even if the results are achieved it could take longer than the announced timeframe before such results may be realized 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates both our dollar profits and our percentage of net sales margin could be negatively affected by decreases in volume 

  

 we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

economicpolitical risks 

both commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall us economy which has been recovering at a slow pace — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall us economy has been adversely affected by this recession although most economists believe that the us economy is now in recovery the pace of recovery has been very slow since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles construction projects have not returned to their prerecession levels 

above average number of foreclosures low housing starts and general weakness in the housing market could continue to negatively affect demand for our products — in most of our markets particularly florida and california sales volumes have been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a significant decline in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until the recovery in residential construction improves 

lack of a multiyear federal highway bill and changes to the funding mechanism for highway funding could cause states to spend less on roads which may negatively impact our revenues — the last multiyear federal transportation bill known as safetealu expired on september 30 2009 since that time funding for transportation projects including highways has been provided by a series of continuing resolutions the current continuing resolution expires on march 31 2012 additionally in january 2011 the us house of representatives passed a new rules package that repealed a longstanding point of order that had protected annual authorized highway funding levels from amendments that could subsequently reduce such authorized levels the rule change could potentially result in an authorized level of funding being subsequently reduced at some point in the legislative process both the lack of a multiyear bill and the change in the funding mechanism increases the uncertainty regarding funds for highway projects this uncertainty could result in state departments of transportation failing to undertake large multiyear highway projects which could in turn negatively affect our sales 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations are subject to environmental zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

  

 climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits among other provisions the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act we have determined that our newbery cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time the first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the newberry cement plant was submitted to the epa on march 31 2011 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change and legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

growth and competitive risks 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices volumes and costs — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are more vertically integrated than we are therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows in certain markets vertically integrated competitors have acquired a portion of our asphalt mix and readymixed concrete customers and this trend may accelerate 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our earnings in the future — construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

personnel risks 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

  

 the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings — the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise we could suffer an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other risks 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship often by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation which could affect our operating results and profitability — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal primarily in connection with our divested chemicals and metals businesses as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve markets in 19 states the district of columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

 

our current estimate of 150 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 03 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2010 estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

  

 proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserves estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 150 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2011 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites we reported proven and probable reserves of 147 billion tons at the end of 2010 using the same basis the table below presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2011 and the types of facilities operated 

 

   1 in addition to the facilities included in the table above we operate 22 recrushed concrete plants which are not dependent on reserves 

of the 150 billion tons of aggregates reserves 86 billion tons or 58 are located on owned land and 64 billion tons or 42 are located on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2012 to 2159 most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion 

  

 the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites for 2011 none of our aggregates facilities contributed more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 asphalt mix concrete and cement 

we also operate a number of other facilities in several of our divisions 

 

   1 includes readymixed concrete concrete block and other concrete products facilities 

  2 includes one cement manufacturing facility and a distribution facility 

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our cement segment operates two limestone quarries in florida which provide our cement production facility with feedstock materials 

 

 headquarters 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is 34 million

 new jersey litigation 

on december 12 2011 martin marietta commenced litigation in the superior court of new jersey’s chancery division for mercer county against vulcan seeking declaratory and injunctive relief the action is captioned martin marietta materials inc v vulcan materials co no c8311 nj super ct in its complaint martin marietta alleges that it has launched an exchange offer and if the offer is successful intends to effect a merger between itself and vulcan martin marietta asks the court to issue declarations that 1 the new jersey shareholders protection act will not apply to the proposed merger 2 simple majority approval of the vulcan shareholders is all that is required under article viii of vulcan’s certificate of incorporation with respect to the proposed merger if either approved by a majority of the continuing directors or the offer price satisfies the price requirements set forth in the charter 3 vulcan may not use certain provisions of its bylaws to hinder or frustrate martin marietta’s anticipated nomination of five candidates for the board of directors at vulcan’s 2012 annual meeting and 4 that martin marietta’s december 12 2011 registration statement complies with the requirements of the securities act of 1933 in addition martin marietta seeks injunctive orders prohibiting vulcan from attempting to use the shareholders protection act to bar the proposed merger from attempting to use article viii of its certificate of incorporation to require 80 shareholder approval of the proposed merger and from attempting to use its bylaws to hinder or frustrate martin marietta’s anticipated nomination of five candidates for the board of directors at vulcan’s 2012 annual meeting 

simultaneous with the filing of its complaint on december 12 2011 martin marietta sought and obtained an order to show cause why expedited discovery should not be permitted on december 20 2011 following briefing and argument the court directed vulcan to file its answer and any motion to dismiss the complaint by january 6 2012 and to respond to martin marietta’s request for discovery by january 31 2012 on january 6 2012 vulcan moved to dismiss counts vi and vii of the complaint and answered the remaining allegations the motion to dismiss was subsequently denied without prejudice

stabilizing markets 

for the twelvemonth period ending december 31 2011 contract awards for highway construction which include federal state and local road and bridge projects were down 6 from 2010 in vulcanserved states however contract awards for more aggregatesintensive roadrelated projects were up 2 over 2010 while bridges were down 18 compared to 2010 we believe this sharp contrast between road and bridge contract award activity is due to the types of projects funded with federal stimulus dollars as well as the increase in spending from regular funding programs by state departments of transportation which in the absence of a new multiyear federal highway bill are currently more focused on maintaining existing capacity 

several developments in congress offer encouragement that federal highway funding is moving in a positive direction the current sixmonth funding extension which was signed into law september 16 2011 is essentially in line with 2011 funding levels notably leaders in congress in both parties have been working to maintain highway funding at or very near current levels at a time of dramatic proposed or actual cuts in many other areas of the federal budget the first three appropriations bills of fiscal year 2012 included appropriations for highways at more than 41 billion consistent with the last two fiscal year funding levels with respect to the reauthorization of the multiyear surface transportation bill both senate and house leaders have stated their intention to move a highway bill in 2012 and began floor debate on bills in the house and senate the week of february 14 2012 

private construction in the us has remained at low levels with some indications of improvement in certain categories singlefamily housing starts remain at historically low levels multifamily housing starts on the other hand have increased sharply since late last year private nonresidential construction has also remained at low levels however trailing twelvemonth contract awards are up across the us for the fourth quarter in a row the growth in contract awards in the manufacturing sector has remained strong since late 2010 and awards for new projects in the categories of retail and office buildings have increased modestly for the third consecutive quarter 

  

 unsolicited exchange offer 

in december 2011 martin marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 050 shares of martin marietta common stock for each vulcan common share and indicated its intention to nominate a slate of directors to our board after careful consideration including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors our board unanimously determined that martin marietta’s offer is inadequate substantially undervalues vulcan and is not in the best interests of vulcan and its shareholders

generally accepted accounting principles gaap does not define “free cash flow” and “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda” thus they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by gaap we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company’s ability to incur and service debt we use free cash flow ebitda and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below 

free cash flow 

free cash flow deducts purchases of property plant  equipment from net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 ebitda 

ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 

 

  

   

  

 results of operations 

net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations we discuss separately our discontinued operations which consist of our former chemicals business 

the following table shows net earnings in relationship to net sales cost of goods sold operating earnings and ebitda 

consolidated operating results 

 

 operating leverage embedded in our business 

the ebitda rebound in 2011 demonstrated the operating leverage embedded in our business as demand recovers we expect this momentum to continue in 2012 due primarily to the continuation of a stable demand environment continued improvement in pricing and our continued focus on 

 

  

  

 since 2007 we have invested 617 million in expense and capital to implement our new erp and shared services platforms we initiated the project to create a common platform for all systems that support our business and have completed all of the major milestones for the project since then these platforms are helping to streamline processes enterprisewide and standardize administrative and support functions while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control costs 

these new platforms enabled us to consolidate our eight divisions into four regions streamline our support function and reduce related positions and overhead costs — resulting in annualized overhead cost savings of over 55 million as a result of these restructuring initiatives we incurred 130 million of severance and related charges during 2011 

  

 to position vulcan for significant earnings growth we remain focused on taking prudent steps to control costs improve liquidity and continue to adjust our product mix and geographic footprint 

we completed several transactions in 2011 that increased our aggregates reserves positions in key markets while improving earnings and liquidity by exiting certain nonstrategic markets over the next 12 to 18 months we plan to sell noncore assets that will generate aftertax net proceeds of approximately 500 million the intended asset sales are consistent with our strategic focus on building leading aggregates reserve positions in markets with aboveaverage longterm demand growth 

the 2011 results include a 464 million recovery from legal settlements reflecting arbitration awards from insurers related to the illinois department of transportation idot lawsuit settled last year for 400 million in addition to these recovery amounts the arbitration awards included 32 million of current year legal fees and interest 

yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 

 

  

 operating results by segment 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 concrete 3 asphalt mix and 4 cement management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

1 aggregates 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments declined 

 

  

  

 despite the yearoveryear decline shipments in the second half of 2011 trended upward primarily due to strength in california and the midatlantic markets the increases in these markets were due mainly to large infrastructure project work principally highway construction and favorable weather 

  

 our yearoveryear freightadjusted selling price for aggregates 

 

  

  

 the average sales price for aggregates increased 1 from the prior year due to improvements across a number of markets including florida tennessee and texas and certain markets in california 

aggregates revenues and gross profits 

 

 

 aggregates gross profit remained relatively stable due mostly to improved pricing and cost containment through productivity gains in labor and energy efficiency labor productivity and energy efficiency both key operating measures improved from the prior year and more than offset a 35 increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel 

  

 2 concrete 

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments declined 

 

  

  

 the concrete segment reported a loss of 434 million in 2011 compared to a loss of 450 million in 2010 readymixed concrete volumes were down 6 while the average sales price increased 6 contributing to a 10 improvement in unit materials margin 

concrete revenues and gross profits 

 

3 asphalt mix 

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments 

 

  

  

 asphalt mix gross profit was 256 million in 2011 compared to 293 million in 2010 due principally to higher liquid asphalt costs the average sales price for asphalt mix increased 8 while liquid asphalt costs increased 17 

asphalt mix revenues and gross profits 

 

  

 4 cement 

the average unit selling price for cement decreased 7 and volumes were down 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 contributing to the 07 million reduction in gross profit 

cement revenues and gross profits 

 

selling administrative and 

general expenses 

 

sag expenses decreased 375 million or 11 from 2010 this 2011 decrease resulted from lower spending in most major overhead categories including lower spending for our it replacement project and the absence of a charge in the current year for property donations additionally the current year expenses included savings from reduced employment levels 

our comparative company employment levels at year end 

 

  

  

 sag expenses for property donations recorded at fair value were as follows 00 million in 2011 92 million in 2010 and 85 million in 2009 the gains from these donations which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value are included in gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income excluding the effect of these property donations sag expenses decreased 283 million in 2011 over 2010 and increased 52 million in 2010 over 2009 

severance charges included in sag expenses were as follows 2011 — 41 million 2010 — 69 million and 2009 — 73 million 

  

 gain on sale of property plant  

equipment and businesses net 

 

the 2011 gain includes a 397 million pretax gain associated with the sale of four nonstrategic aggregates facilities and a 06 million pretax gain associated with an exchange of assets see note 19 “acquisitions and divestitures” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the 2010 gain includes a 395 million pretax gain associated with the sale of three nonstrategic aggregates facilities the 2009 gain was primarily related to sales and donations of real estate 

interest expense 

 

the 2011 increase in interest expense resulted primarily from our debt refinancing completed in june in addition to higher effective interest rates on the new debt we incurred 262 million of charges in connection with our tender offer and debt retirement these charges resulted from the 184 million difference between the purchase price and par value of the notes purchased in the tender offer 07 million in transaction fees and 81 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized discounts deferred financing costs and amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the retired debt 

income taxes 

our income tax benefit from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

 

 the 112 million decrease in our 2011 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the 2011 decreased loss from continuing operations the 518 million increase in our 2010 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the increased loss from continuing operations a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 2011 2010 and 2009 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

 discontinued operations 

pretax earnings from discontinued operations were 

 

  

  

 the 2011 pretax earnings includes pretax gains totaling 186 million related to the 5cp earnout and insurance recoveries compared to similar pretax gains totaling 139 million in 2010 the 2009 pretax earnings from discontinued operations resulted primarily from settlements with two of our insurers in perchloroethylene lawsuits resulting in pretax gains of 235 million these gains were partially offset by general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5cp earnout see note 2 “discontinued operations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and financial resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets additional financial resources include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements including 

 

  

  

  

  

 on october 14 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of one cent per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the 25 cents per share quarterly dividend paid in the third quarter of 2011 on february 15 2012 our board declared a dividend of one cent per share for the first quarter of 2012 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 cash 

included in our cash and cash equivalents balance of 1558 million is 401 million of cash held at one of our foreign subsidiaries this cash is not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated we have no plans to repatriate the cash as the earnings from this subsidiary are indefinitely reinvested if we distribute the earnings in the form of dividends the distribution would be subject to us income taxes 

cash from operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

 

 2011 versus 2010 — although net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization increased to 2909 million from 2856 million net cash provided by operating activities decreased 337 million operating cash flows were negatively impacted by changes in our working capital accounts which used 253 million in cash in 2011 compared to 372 million of cash generated in 2010 this increase in cash outflows was partially offset by a decrease in contributions to pension plans from 245 million in 2010 to 49 million in 2011 

2010 versus 2009 — lower net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization caused the majority of the 2503 million decrease in operating cash flows cash received associated with gains on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities and accounts for 402 million of the 2503 million yearoveryear decrease in operating cash flows 

  

 cash from investing activities 

 

2011 versus 2010 — net cash used for investing activities of 195 million decreased 689 million from 2010 proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic businesses increased 238 million yearoveryear to 747 million in 2011 we utilized an asset swap strategy to acquire aggregates facilities in high growth markets while disposing of nonstrategic assets this strategy allowed us to acquire net assets valued at 354 million for a cash outlay of 105 million accordingly cash used to acquire businesses decreased by 600 million compared to 2010 cash used for the purchase of property plant  equipment totaled 989 million in 2011 compared to 863 million in 2010 and 1097 million in 2009 

2010 versus 2009 — net cash used for investing activities totaled 884 million compared to 800 million in 2009 an increase of 84 million the positive cash flows from an increase in proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic businesses of 349 million and the decrease in cash used for capital projects were more than offset by a 336 million increase in payments for businesses acquired and a 333 million decrease in the redemption of mediumterm investments 

cash from financing activities 

 

2011 versus 2010 — net cash used for financing activities of 413 million decreased 478 million from 2010 increases in financing cash flows were largely due to an increase in cash flows related to debt of 715 million this net positive cash flow variance includes proceeds and payments of shortterm and longterm debt debt issuance costs cash paid to purchase our own debt at a premium above par value and proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swap agreements the positive cash flows from debtrelated items and the 296 million decrease in dividends paid largely as a result of the dividend reduction in the fourth quarter of 2011 were partially offset by yearoveryear decreases in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options totaling 537 million 

2010 versus 2009 — net cash used for financing activities totaled 891 million compared to 3610 million during 2009 during 2010 we reduced total debt by 198 million despite a significant yearoveryear decline in cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2009 we reduced our dividend per share to 025 from 049 declared and paid in the prior two quarters of 2009 resulting in comparative cash savings of 919 million during 2010 

  

 debt 

 

 in june 2011 we issued 11 billion of longterm notes in two series as follows 5000 million of 650 notes due in 2016 and 6000 million of 750 notes due in 2021 these notes were issued principally to 

 

  

  

  

 this debt issuance and retirement transaction lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides financial flexibility to continue investing in our business as the economy recovers 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we replaced our 15 billion bank line of credit that was due to expire on november 16 2012 with a 6000 million bank line of credit we proactively reduced the size of the bank line of credit to match the current and expected needs of the business — the 15 billion bank line of credit was established in connection with the acquisition of florida rock and the initial borrowings were largely refinanced with other debt instruments 

the 6000 million bank line of credit expires on december 15 2016 and is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory borrowing capacity fluctuates with the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and may be less than 6000 million at any point in time 

utilization of the borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit as of december 31 2011 

 

  

   

 borrowings under the 6000 million bank line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the lower of the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from 175 to 225 based on the level of utilization or an alternative rate derived from the lender’s prime rate borrowings bearing interest at libor plus the margin are made for periods of 1 2 3 or 6 months and may be extended borrowings bearing interest at an alternative rate are made on an overnight basis and may be extended each day letters of credit issued under the 6000 million bank line of credit are charged a fee equal to the applicable margin for borrowings as of december 31 2011 the applicable margin was 175 

borrowings under the 6000 million bank line of credit are classified as longterm debt due to our ability to extend borrowings at the end of each borrowing period previously we classified bank line of credit borrowings as shortterm debt based on our intent to pay outstanding borrowings within one year 

as of december 31 2011 debt maturities for the next five years were as follows 

 

 we expect to retire debt maturities using existing cash cash generated from operations by drawing on our bank line of credit or accessing the capital markets 

debt covenants 

the 6000 million bank line of credit contains covenant limitations on liens indebtedness guarantees certain restricted payments and acquisitions and divestitures and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is only applicable if utilization exceeds 90 of the lesser of 6000 million or the borrowing capacity derived from the sum of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 

the indentures governing our notes contain a covenant limiting our total debt as a percentage of total capital to 65 our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 426 as of december 31 2011 compared with 407 as of december 31 2010 

debt ratings 

our shortterm debt ratingoutlook as of december 31 2011 was 

 

 in october 2011 standard and poor’s withdrew our shortterm debt ratingoutlook at our request the rating bnegative was deemed unnecessary as we had no outstanding commercial paper and access to the commercial paper market was unavailable at the current credit rating 

our longterm debt ratingsoutlooks as of december 31 2011 were 

 

  

 subsequent to the december 2011 unsolicited exchange offer from martin marietta moody’s placed our ratings under review with direction uncertain 

  

 equity 

our common stock outstanding increased 07 million shares from january 1 2011 to december 31 2011 

 

 in 2009 we sold 132 million shares of common stock par value of 1 per share in a public offering for net proceeds of 5200 million 

as explained in more detail in note 13 “equity” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” common stock issued in connection with business acquisitions were 

 

  

 we periodically sell shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k savings and retirement plan to satisfy the plan participants’ elections to invest in our common stock this arrangement provides a means of improving cash flow increasing equity and reducing leverage under this arrangement the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the years ended december 31 were 

 

  

  

 in 2010 we issued 12 million shares of common stock par value of 1 per share to our qualified pension plans as explained in note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” this transaction increased equity by 539 million common stock 12 million and capital in excess of par 527 million 

there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 there were 3411416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors as of december 31 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 standby letters of credit 

for a discussion of our standby letters of credit see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

cash contractual obligations 

we expect cash requirements for income taxes of 58 million during 2012 additionally we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings these contracts are discrete and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event excluding future cash requirements for income taxes and these discrete in nature contracts our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 2011 are summarized in the table below 

 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

   

 critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

3 reclamation costs 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

5 environmental compliance 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

1 goodwill and 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2011 goodwill represents 38 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 

our assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ from those estimates changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

  

 how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a twostep process we have identified 13 reporting units that represent operations or groups of operations one level below our operating segments 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 

 

  

 step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill 

 

 how we determine carrying value and fair value 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies finally we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization 

results of our impairment tests 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 

 

  

  

 the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flows dcf model of the aggregates reporting unit for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8 were growth rates for volume price and variable costs to produce capital requirements and the discount rate based on our historical experience and macroeconomic forecasts for each of the counties that are served by our operations we developed projections for volume price and cost growth rates subsequently projections were revised downwards to reflect assumptions that we believe a market participant not privy to our internal information would make based on information available through normal and customary due diligence procedures accordingly the dcf model assumes that over a twenty year projection period volumes pricing and variable cost grow at inflationadjusted real average annual rates of 48 09 and 07 respectively our capital spending assumptions are based on the level of projected volume and our historical experience for goodwill impairment testing purposes we utilized a 950 discount rate to present value the estimated future cash flows 

the market approach was based on multiples of revenue and ebitda to enterprise value for comparative public companies the six data points derived from the revenue and ebitda multiples for the past three years trailing twelve months and analysts’ estimates for next year were averaged to arrive at the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

delays in a sustained recovery in our gulf coast markets may result in an impairment of this reporting unit’s goodwill 

  

 for additional information regarding goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

2 impairment of longlived assets 

excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2011 net property plant  equipment represents 42 of total assets while net other intangible assets represents 8 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

we test longlived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets as a result our longlived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment in markets where we do not produce downstream products eg readymixed concrete and asphalt mix the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market conversely in vertically integrated markets the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products aggregates and cement determines the profitability of the downstream business 

longlived asset impairments during 2011 were immaterial and related to property abandonments during 2010 we recorded a 39 million loss on impairment of longlived assets the loss on impairment was a result of the challenging construction environment which impacted nonstrategic assets across multiple operating segments there were no longlived asset impairments during 2009 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

3 reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations 1540 million as of december 31 2011 

how we determine fair value of the obligation 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated 

  

 market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 “asset retirement obligations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

4 pension and other 

postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 

 

  

  

  

 how we set our assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds at december 31 2011 the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 415 to 508 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2011 the expected return on plan assets remained consistent with 2010 at 80 and was down from 825 in 2009 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience and future expectations at december 31 2011 our projected weightedaverage rate of compensation remained 350 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 2011 our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was 750 for 2012 decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 2017 and remaining level thereafter 

  

 changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

 

 

 as of december 31 2008 our master pension trust had assets invested at westridge capital management inc wcm with a reported fair value of 592 million in february 2009 the new york district court appointed a receiver over wcm due to allegations of fraud and other violations of federal commodities and securities laws by principals of a wcm affiliate in light of these allegations we reassessed the fair value of our investments at wcm and recorded a 480 million writedown in the estimated fair value of these assets for the year ended december 31 2008 during 2011 the fair value of assets increased from 6303 million to 6366 million due primarily to the recovery of an additional 220 million from wcm’s courtappointed receiver this recovery resulted in the recognition of a 108 million return on plan assets net of the 112 million remaining wcm investment during 2010 wcm receipts included a 66 million release from the receiver as a partial distribution and a 150 million insurance settlement for the loss 

during 2012 we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately 370 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately 116 million compared to 257 million and 117 million respectively in 2011 the increase in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate and the change to reflect generational mortality improvement for the qualified pension plans the increase in pension expense is also due to lower than expected asset returns in 2011 as a result of our 2010 pension contributions of 725 million in march and 13 million in july we do not expect to make any contributions to the funded pension plans during 2012 assuming actuarial assumptions are realized existing funding credit balances are sufficient to fund projected minimum required contributions through 2012 we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

5 environmental compliance 

our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 

how we account for environmental costs 

to account for environmental costs we 

 

  

  

   

 at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2011 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 41 million 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

6 claims and litigation 

including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

how we assess the probability of loss 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

7 income taxes 

how we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities annually we compare the liabilities calculated for our federal state and foreign income tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of the year end income tax provision any adjustments are reflected in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

 we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement at least quarterly we assess all positive and negative evidence to determine the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income we take into account such factors as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would charge an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings conversely if we were to determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance would be reduced and we would record a benefit to earnings 

foreign earnings 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore we periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and accordingly whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 

unrecognized income tax benefits 

we recognize an income tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority our liability associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we consider appropriate 

before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized income tax benefit is audited and finally resolved a number of years may elapse the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is adequate favorable resolution of an unrecognized income tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our income tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized income tax benefit could increase the income tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution 

we consider an issue to be resolved at the earlier of settlement of an examination the expiration of the statute of limitations or when the issue is “effectively settled” our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as income tax expense 

statutory depletion 

our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings

 item 7a tableend quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

in june 2011 we issued 5000 million of 650 fixedrate notes due in 2016 concurrently we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of 5000 million under these agreements we paid 6month libor plus a spread of 405 and received a fixed interest rate of 650 additionally in june 2011 we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our 1500 million of 10125 fixedrate notes due in 2015 under these agreements we paid 6month libor plus a spread of 803 and received a fixed interest rate of 10125 in august 2011 we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for 254 million of cash proceeds the 234 million forward component of the settlement cash proceeds less 20 million of accrued interest was added to the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining lives of the related debt using the effective interest method 

in december 2007 we issued 3250 million of floatingrate notes due in 2010 that bore interest at 3month libor plus 125 per annum concurrently we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the stated amount of 3250 million the swap agreement terminated december 15 2010 coinciding with the maturity of the notes the realized gains and losses upon settlement related to the swap agreement are reflected in interest expense concurrent with the hedged interest payments on the debt 

at december 31 2011 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was 29313 million compared to a book value of 28154 million the estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on creditadjusted interest rates on us treasury bills notes or bonds as appropriate the fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by 1577 million 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

disclosure controls 

and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d 15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2011 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

we are in the process of replacing our legacy information technology systems and have substantially completed the implementation of new financial reporting software which is a major component of the replacement we are also in the process of implementing a new quote to cash software system which is another significant component of the replacement the new information technology systems were a source for most of the information presented in this annual report on form 10k we are continuing to work toward the full implementation of the new information technology systems 

no other changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that could materially affect these controls during the fourth quarter of 2011 

management’s report on internal 

control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

under management’s supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 deloitte  touche llp’s report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

  

 report of independent registered public accounting firm – 

internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the “company” as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 and our report dated february 29 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and contained an explanatory paragraph making reference to the company’s adoption in 2011 of accounting standards update 201105 presentation of comprehensive income

business 

 

summary 

 

vulcan materials company is a new jersey corporation and the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel we have 319 aggregates facilities we also are a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in florida

major acquisitions 

 

 

 

  

competitors 

 

we operate in an industry that is very fragmented with a large number of small privatelyheld companies we estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30 to 35 of the total us aggregates production despite being the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include the following 

 

  

because the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with approximately 5000 companies managing more than 9000 operations many opportunities for consolidation exist therefore companies in the industry tend to grow by entering new markets or enhancing their market positions by acquiring existing facilities 

 

 

 

business strategy 

 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the us economy our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in all types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges railroads and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy the following graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to sales 

 

aggregatesled value creation — 2010 net sales 

 

 

 represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates 

 

our business strategies include 1 aggregates focus 2 coasttocoast footprint 3 profitable growth and 4 effective land management 

 

1 aggregates focus 

 

aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist our focus on aggregates allows us to 

 

  

 

2 coasttocoast footprint 

 

demand for construction aggregates positively correlates with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly 

 

 

source moody’s analytics 

 

our top ten revenueproducing states are predicted to have 66 of the total growth in the us population between now and 2020 vulcanserved states are predicted to have 78 of the total growth in the us population between now and 2020 therefore we have located reserves in those markets expected to have the greatest growth in population additionally many of these reserves are located in areas where zoning and permitting laws have made opening new quarries increasingly difficult our diversified geographic locations help insulate vulcan from variations in regional weather and economies 

 

3 profitable growth 

 

our growth is a result of acquisitions cost management and investment activities 

 

  

in 2007 we acquired florida rock industries inc the largest acquisition in our history this acquisition 

 

  

in addition to these large acquisitions we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth 

 

  

 

 

4 effective land management 

 

at vulcan we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility and that it contributes to our success good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land therefore we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective postmining land management we continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future 

 

product lines 

 

we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines 

 

  

1 aggregates 

 

 

a number of factors affect the us aggregates industry and our business including markets reserves and demand cycles 

 

  

 

  

highway construction is the most aggregatesintensive form of construction and residential construction is the least intensive see table below a dollar spent for highway construction is estimated to consume seven times the quantity of aggregates consumed by a dollar spent for residential construction other nonhighway infrastructure markets like airports sewer and waste disposal or water supply plants and utilities also require large quantities of aggregates in their foundations and structures these types of infrastructurerelated construction can be four times more aggregatesintensive than residential construction generally nonresidential buildings require two to three times as much aggregates per dollar of spending as a new home with most of the aggregates used in the foundations building structure and parking lots 

 

us aggregates demand by endmarket 

 

 

source internal estimates 

 

in addition the following factors influence the aggregates market 

 

  

 

 

  

our markets 

 

we focus on the us markets with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or with access to economical transportation to their markets we serve both the public and the private sectors 

 

public sector 

 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2010 publicly funded construction accounted for 55 of our total aggregates shipments 

 

public sector funding generally public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multiyear legislation and programs for example the federal transportation bill is a principal source of federal funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects for over two decades projects have been funded through a series of multiyear bills the longterm aspect of these bills is critical because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longterm and complex highway projects federal highway spending is governed by multiyear authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the federal highway trust fund this trust receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies the level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies in 2010 approximately 30 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 

 

changes in multiyear funding the most recent federal transportation bill known as safetealu expired on september 30 2009 congress has yet to pass a replacement bill as a result funds for highway construction are being provided by a series of authorized extensions with appropriations at fiscal year 2010 levels this uncertainty in funding may lead some states to defer large multiyear projects until such time as there is greater certainty of funding 

 

need for public infrastructure a significant need exists for additional and ongoing investments in the nation’s infrastructure in 2009 a report by the american society of civil engineers asce gave our nation’s infrastructure an overall grade of “d” and estimated that an investment of 22 trillion over a fiveyear period is needed for improvements while the needs are clear the source of funding for infrastructure improvements is not in its report the asce suggests that all levels of government owners and users need to renew their commitment to infrastructure investments in all categories and that all available financing options should be explored and debated 

 

 

federal stimulus impact the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the stimulus or arra was signed into law on february 17 2009 to create jobs and restore economic growth through among other things the modernization of america’s infrastructure and improving its energy resources included in the 787 billion of economic stimulus funding is 50 to 60 billion of heavy construction including 275 billion for highways and bridges this federal funding for highways and bridges unlike typical federal funding programs for infrastructure does not require states to provide matching funds the nature of the projects that are being funded by arra generally will require considerable quantities of aggregates 

 

publiclyfunded construction activity increased in 2010 due mostly to the stimulus according to the federal highway administration approximately 71 billion or 43 of the total stimulus funds apportioned for highways and bridges in vulcanserved states remains to be spent the pace of obligating bidding awarding and starting stimulusrelated highway construction projects has varied widely across states these statebystate differences in awarding projects and spending patterns are due in part to the types of planned projects and to the proportion suballocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming 

 

despite the failure of congress to pass a fullyfunded extension of safetealu the previous highway authorization that expired on september 30 2009 total contract awards for federal state and local highways in 2010 increased 2 from 2009 moreover contract awards for public highway projects in vulcanserved states increased 5 from the prior year versus a 2 decline in other states we are encouraged by the increased award activity and are optimistic that stimulusrelated highway projects in vulcanserved states will increase demand for our products in 2011 

 

private sector 

 

the private sector market includes both nonresidential buildings and residential construction and is more cyclical than public construction in 2010 privatelyfunded construction accounted for 45 of our total aggregates shipments 

 

nonresidential construction private nonresidential construction includes a wide array of types of projects such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction but less aggregates intensive than public construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction is generally driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends the growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals churches and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm’s ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing 

 

consistent with past cycles of private sector construction private nonresidential construction remained strong after residential construction peaked in 2006 however in late 2007 contract awards for nonresidential buildings peaked in 2008 contract awards in the us declined 24 from the prior year and in 2009 fell sharply declining 56 from 2008 levels contract awards for stores and office buildings were the weakest categories of nonresidential construction in 2009 declining more than 60 from the prior year employment growth more attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive growth in construction activity in this end market 

 

residential construction the majority of residential construction is for singlefamily houses with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises only a small portion of the housing demand household formations in vulcan’s markets have grown faster than the us as a whole in the last 10 years during that time household growth was 12 in our markets compared to 6 in the remainder of the us construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of driveways or parking lots 

 

 

 

us housing starts as measured by mcgrawhill data peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually by the end of 2009 total housing starts had declined to less than 600000 units well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually however in the summer of 2009 singlefamily housing starts began to stabilize as evidenced by the graph below by the end of 2010 singlefamily starts exhibited some modest growth breaking almost four consecutive years of decline 

 

private construction activity comparison 

trailing twelve months ending dec 2004 100 

 

 

source mcgrawhill 

 

in 2010 total us housing starts increased 4 from the prior year while these results don’t necessarily indicate a sustained recovery in residential construction the modest improvement in construction activity is encouraging lower home prices attractive mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale provide some optimism for housing construction in 2011 and beyond 

 

additional aggregates products and markets 

 

we sell ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad track we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways in addition stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 

 

our competitive advantage 

 

we are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the united states the aggregates market is highly fragmented with many small independent producers therefore depending on the market we may compete with large national or regional firms as well as relatively small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value markets generally are local in nature thus the cost to deliver product to the location where it is used is an important competitive factor 

 

 

we serve metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future a market often consists of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties where transportation from the producing location to the customer is by truck only approximately 80 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively by truck and another 13 are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard sales yards and other distribution facilities located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets that do not have locally available sources of aggregates 

 

zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries however such regulations while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 

 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

2 concrete 

 

we produce and sell readymixed concrete in arizona california florida georgia maryland new mexico texas and virginia additionally we produce and sell in a limited number of these markets other concrete products such as block and precast beams we also resell purchased building materials for use with readymixed concrete and concrete block 

 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 78 by weight of this product we meet the aggregates requirements of our concrete segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

 

we serve our concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility 

 

readymixed concrete production also requires cement in the florida market cement requirements for readymixed concrete production are supplied substantially by our cement segment in other markets we purchase cement from thirdparty suppliers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

 

3 asphalt mix 

 

we produce and sell asphalt mix in arizona california new mexico and texas this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix comprising approximately 95 by weight of this product we meet the aggregates requirements for our asphalt mix segment almost wholly through our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

 

because asphalt mix hardens rapidly delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility the asphalt production process requires liquid asphalt which we purchase entirely from thirdparty producers we serve our asphalt mix segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck 

 

4 cement 

 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry our tampa florida facility can import and export cement and slag some of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the cement is blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form our port manatee florida facility can import cement clinker

 

 

that is ground into bulk cement and sold our brooksville florida plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics and joint compound industries 

 

the cement segment’s largest single customer is our own readymixed concrete operations within the concrete segment 

 

during 2010 we began operating the newly expanded newberry cement facility this plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility these limestone reserves total 1927 million tons 

 

our brooksville florida calcium facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry the calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total 63 million tons 

 

other business related items 

 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

 

almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products therefore the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

 

customers 

 

no material part of our business is dependent upon any customers whose loss would have an adverse effect on our business in 2010 our top five customers accounted for 43 of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 13 of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

 

research and development costs 

 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at our technical service center in birmingham alabama in general these efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products and support customers in pursuing the most efficient use of our products we spent 16 million in 2010 and 15 million in both 2009 and 2008 on research and development activities

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including regulation of noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2011 and 2012 will be approximately 84 million and 105 million respectively 

 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin

 

 

all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

risk factors 

 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the following is a list of our risk factors 

 

financialaccounting risks 

 

we incurred additional debt to finance the florida rock merger which significantly increased our interest expense financial leverage and debt service requirements — we incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger this debt which significantly increased our leverage has been a significant factor resulting in downgrades in our credit ratings 

 

our cash flow is reduced by payments of principal and interest on this debt our debt instruments contain various financial and contractual restrictions if we fail to comply with any of these covenants the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity an event of default under our debt instruments 

 

 

also could significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing our debt ratings are currently under review for possible downgrade if one or both rating agencies downgrade our ratings it could further affect our ability to access financing 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

 

difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows — the current economic environment has negatively affected the us economy and demand for our products commercial and residential construction may continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations of capital projects 

 

a slow economic recovery also may increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on our accounts receivable from our customers we have experienced payment delays from some of our customers during this economic downturn 

 

the credit environment could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing and if available it may not be at economically favorable terms interest rates on new issuances of longterm public debt in the market may increase due to higher credit spreads and risk premiums there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at favorable interest rates which could negatively affect our financial results 

 

we may need to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or refinance our outstanding debt we also are exposed to risks from tightening credit markets especially in regard to access to debt and equity capital 

 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates both our dollar profits and our percentage of net sales margin can be negatively affected by decreases in volume 

 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 6 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for 

 

  

we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates however these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

economicpolitical risks 

 

both commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall us economy which has been recovering at a slow pace — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall us economy has been adversely affected by this recession although most economists believe that the us economy is now in recovery the pace of recovery has been very slow since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles construction projects have not returned to their prerecession levels 

 

above average number of foreclosures low housing starts and general weakness in the housing market continue to negatively affect demand for our products — in most of our markets particularly florida and california sales volumes have been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a significant decline in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings 

 

 

could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until the recovery in residential construction improves 

 

lack of a multiyear federal highway bill and changes to the funding mechanism for highway funding could cause states to spend less on roads — the last multiyear federal transportation bill known as safetealu expired on september 30 2009 since that time funding for transportation projects including highways has been provided pursuant to a series of continuing resolutions and the hire act the current continuing resolution is set to expire on march 4 2011 additionally in january 2011 the house passed a new rules package that repealed transportation law dating back to 1998 which protected annual funding levels from amendments that could reduce such funding this rule change subjects funding for highways to yearly appropriation reviews both the lack of a multiyear bill and the change in the funding mechanism increases the uncertainty of many state departments of transportation regarding funds for highway projects this uncertainty could result in states being reluctant to undertake large multiyear highway projects which could in turn negatively affect our sales 

 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law impact our business — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business especially from an environmental standpoint these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability in addition our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with zoning and environmental laws and regulations stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change such legislation or regulation if enacted potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits among other provisions the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule referred to as the “tailoring rule” which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act we have determined that our newbery cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time the first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the newberry cement plant will be submitted to the federal epa by march 31 2011 

 

other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities and potential impacts from sea level changes there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 

 

the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate however climate change and legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

growth and competitive risks 

 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets additionally in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are more vertically integrated than we are therefore there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate this significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows in certain markets vertically integrated competitors have acquired a portion of our asphalt mix and readymixed concrete customers and this trend may continue to accelerate 

 

our longterm success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas — construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop

 

 

therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

 

our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves disruptions in the availability of credit and financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

 

personnel risks 

 

our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings — the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise we could suffer an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

other risks 

 

weather can materially affect our operating results — almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand because their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship primarily by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

 

 

we are involved in certain environmental matters we cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — we are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal primarily in connection with our divested chemicals and metals businesses as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant environmental matters see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

aggregates 

 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve markets in 21 states the district of columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

 

 

 

our current estimate of 147 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 05 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2009 estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade and quality of those reserves are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserves estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

 

the 147 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2010 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites we reported proven and probable reserves of 142 billion tons at the end of 2009 using the same basis the table below presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2010 and the types of facilities operated 

 

 

 

  

of the 147 billion tons of aggregates reserves 83 billion tons or 56 are located on owned land and 64 billion tons or 44 are located on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2011 to 2159 most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion 

 

 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of the listed aggregates facilities other than playa del carmen contributes more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 

 

asphalt mix concrete and cement 

 

we also operate a number of other facilities in several of our divisions 

 

 

 

  

the asphalt mix and concrete facilities are able to meet their needs for raw material inputs with a combination of internally sourced and purchased raw materials our cement segment operates two limestone quarries in florida which provide our cement production facility with feedstock materials 

 

 

 

headquarters 

 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2023 with three fiveyear renewal periods and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is 34 million

legal proceedings 

 

 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels

stabilizing markets in 2010 

 

in 2010 the yearoveryear decline in trailing twelvemonth aggregates shipments slowed significantly from the prior three years during the period from 2007 through 2009 aggregates shipments — adjusted to include major acquisitions and exclude divestitures — declined 11 in 2007 21 in 2008 and 26 in 2009 in 2010 aggregates shipments declined only 2 from the prior year reflecting varied market demand conditions across our markets aggregates shipments in 2010 benefited from increased highway construction activity and some improvement in housing new home construction declined to historically low levels in 2009 then after 43 consecutive months of yearoveryear declines singlefamily housing starts

 

 

began to improve in late 2009 by the end of 2010 full year singlefamily housing starts as measured by mcgrawhill construction had increased 2 from 2009 and multifamily housing starts increased 8 tight credit has contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings particularly stores and offices however the rate of decline in private nonresidential construction began to slow late in 2010 construction activity funded by the public sector typically less affected in economic cycles increased in 2010 due mostly to the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra during the twelve months ended december 2010 total contract awards for highway construction in vulcanserved states including awards for federal state and local projects increased 5 from the prior year compared to a decrease of 2 for other states the positive effects of arra spending in 2010 were somewhat offset by the failure of congress to reauthorize the most recent multiyear federal transportation bill known as safetealu which expired on september 30 2009 the federal transportation program was funded through a series of shortterm extensions in late 2009 and early 2010 passage of the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act in march 2010 included authorized funding for transportation programs through december 31 2010 

 

arra includes economic stimulus funding of 50 to 60 billion for heavy construction projects including 275 billion for highways and bridges vulcanserved states were apportioned 55 more funds than other states with california texas and florida receiving 23 of the total for highways and bridges the challenge of meeting arra deadlines to ensure use of federal funds coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the regular federal highway bill led many states to slow the pace of obligating new projects funded by regular federal funding for highways during the first nine months of fiscal year ended september 30 2010 during the last three months of the fiscal year 2010 obligation of funds for projects was at record levels 

 

according to the federal highway administration approximately 71 billion or 43 of the total stimulus funds apportioned for highways and bridges in vulcanserved states remains to be spent the vast majority of this unspent amount 54 billion is located in vulcan’s top 10 revenue producing states — california virginia florida texas tennessee georgia illinois north carolina alabama and south carolina 

 

the pace of obligating bidding awarding and starting stimulusrelated highway construction projects has varied widely across states these statebystate differences in awarding projects and spending patterns are due in part to the types of planned projects and to the proportion suballocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming 

 

we have worked diligently throughout this downturn to position our company for earnings growth when demand recovers improved stability in the economic factors that drive demand for our products will bring the strength of our fundamentals back into focus vulcan 

 

  

as a result of these efforts cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in 2010 was 26 higher than at the peak of demand in 2005 

 

 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

 

generally accepted accounting principles gaap does not define “free cash flow” and “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda” thus they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by gaap we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analysis and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company’s ability to incur and service debt we use free cash flow ebitda and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below 

 

free cash flow 

 

free cash flow deducts purchases of property plant  equipment from net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 

 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

 

ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we adjusted ebitda in 2008 to exclude the noncash charge for goodwill impairment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

intersegment sales are internal sales between any of our four operating segments 

 

1 aggregates 

 

2 concrete 

 

3 asphalt mix 

 

4 cement 

 

intersegment sales consist of our aggregates and cement segments selling product to our concrete segment and our aggregates segment selling product to our asphalt mix segment we include intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment revenue at the product line level these intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations we discuss separately our discontinued operations which consist of our former chemicals business 

 

the following table shows net earnings in relationship to net sales cost of goods sold operating earnings and ebitda 

 

consolidated operating results 

 

 

 

the length and depth of the decline in construction activity and aggregates demand during this economic downturn have been unprecedented our aggregates shipments in 2010 were just over half the level shipped in 2005 when demand peaked we continued to manage our business to maximize cash generation in 2010 we again reduced inventory levels of aggregates while this action negatively affected reported earnings it increased cash generation and better positions us to increase production and earnings as demand recovers we also continued to reduce our overhead expenses cost associated with implementing some of these reductions increased selling administrative and general expense in 2010 however the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in 2011 and beyond 

 

 

the 2010 results include 430 million of pretax charges related to the settlement of a lawsuit with the illinois department of transportation idot a 395 million pretax gain associated with the sale of nonstrategic assets in rural virginia and increased pretax costs of 514 million related to higher unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt while we believed that the idot settlement was covered by insurance we did not recognize its recovery as of december 31 2010 due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of a recovery however in february 2011 we completed the first of two arbitrations in which two of our three insurers participated the arbitration panel awarded us a total of 255 million in payment of their share of the settlement amount and attorneys’ fees this award will be recorded as income in the first quarter of 2011 

 

the 2008 results include a 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for our cement segment the 2008 results also include a 738 million pretax gain from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval of the florida rock acquisition by the department of justice 

 

yearoveryear changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 

 

 

 

  

operating results by segment 

 

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines 1 aggregates 2 concrete 3 asphalt mix and 4 cement management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

 

 

  

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments declined 

 

  

to date the economic recovery has not had a significant effect on some of our key endmarkets or key regional markets as a result market conditions varied across our markets throughout the year aggregates shipments declined sharply in certain markets such as north carolina florida and georgia while shipments increased modestly in other markets such as south carolina tennessee and texas 

 

our yearoveryear aggregates selling price 

 

  

since 2006 our aggregates selling price has cumulatively increased 22 the 2010 decline in aggregates selling price was due primarily to weakness in demand in florida and california in florida demand remained relatively weak throughout the year while demand for aggregates in california exhibited some modest growth in the fourth quarter versus 2009 

 

aggregates revenues and gross profits 

 

 

 

 

we continued tight management of our controllable plant operating costs to match weak demand the 731 million decline in gross profits resulted primarily from the 2 decreases in both freightadjusted selling prices and shipments as well as a 

 

 

30 increase in the unit cost of diesel fuel excluding the earnings effect of higher diesel fuel costs unit cost of sales for aggregates increased modestly from 2009 

 

  

our yearoveryear readymixed concrete shipments 

 

  

the 2008 yearoveryear increase in readymixed concrete shipments resulted from the november 2007 acquisition of florida rock and the resulting full year of shipments in 2008 versus only two months in 2007 

 

the average selling price for readymixed concrete declined 10 in 2010 and accounted for the yearoveryear decline in this segment’s gross profit raw material costs were lower than 2009 and more than offset the effects of a 5 decline in shipments 

 

concrete revenues and gross profits 

 

 

  

our yearoveryear asphalt mix shipments declined 

 

  

asphalt mix segment earnings declined 397 million from 2009 due mostly to a 20 increase in the average unit cost for liquid asphalt higher liquid asphalt costs lowered segment earnings 271 million in 2010 the average selling price for asphalt mix declined 4 as selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag increasing liquid asphalt costs and were further held in check due to competitive pressures 

 

 

asphalt mix revenues and gross profits 

 

 

  

the average unit selling price for cement decreased 17 more than offsetting the earnings effect of a 32 increase in unit sales volumes the increase in unit sales volumes was primarily attributable to an increase in intersegment sales 

 

cement revenues and gross profits 

 

 

selling administrative and general expenses 

 

additional costs associated with implementing some overhead expense reductions actually increased selling administrative and general sag expenses for 2010 however the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in 2011 and beyond on a comparable basis sag costs in 2010 were 41 million lower than 2009 benefits related to our project to replace legacy it systems began to be realized in 2010 reducing project costs for the year we expect additional benefits from this project in 2011 the 2009 decline in sag cost was due primarily to reductions in employeerelated expenses which more than offset a yearoveryear increase in project costs for the replacement of legacy it systems 

 

 

 

sag includes expenses for property donations recorded at fair value as follows 92 million in 2010 85 million in 2009 and 105 million in 2008 the gains from these donations which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value are included in gain on sale of property plant  equipment in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income excluding the effect of these property donations sag expenses increased 52 million in 2010 and decreased 190 million in 2009 

 

our yearover year total company employment levels declined 

 

  

goodwill impairment 

 

there were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2010 and 2009 during 2008 we recorded a 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement segment representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit we acquired these operations as part of the florida rock transaction in november 2007 for additional details regarding this impairment see the goodwill and goodwill impairment critical accounting policy 

 

gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses net 

 

the 2010 gain includes a 395 million pretax gain associated with the sale of nonstrategic assets in rural virginia the 2009 gain was primarily related to sales and donations of real estate mostly in california included in the 2008 gains was a 738 million pretax gain for quarry sites divested as a condition for approval of the florida rock acquisition by the department of justice 

 

 

interest expense 

 

 

excluding capitalized interest credits gross interest expense for 2010 was 1852 million compared to 1860 million in 2009 and 1871 million in 2008 

 

 

income taxes 

 

our income tax provision benefit for continuing operations for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

 

 

 

the 518 million increase in our 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the increased loss from continuing operations the 1096 million increase in our 2009 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the 2009 loss from continuing operations the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge taken in 2008 and the decrease in the state income tax provision offset in part by a decrease in the benefit for statutory depletion a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 2010 2009 and 2008 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

discontinued operations 

 

pretax earnings loss from discontinued operations were 

 

  

the 2010 pretax earnings include pretax gains totaling 139 million related to the 5cp earnout and a recovery from an insurer in the perchloroethylene lawsuits associated with our former chemicals business the 2009 pretax earnings from discontinued operations resulted primarily from settlements with two of our insurers in the aforementioned perchloroethylene lawsuits resulting in pretax gains of 235 million the insurance proceeds and associated gains represent a partial recovery of legal and settlement costs recognized in prior years the 2008 pretax losses from discontinued operations and the remaining results from 2009 and 2010 reflect charges primarily related to general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business for additional information regarding discontinued operations see note 2 “discontinued operations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

 

cash and liquidity 

 

our primary source of liquidity is cash from our operating activities our additional financial resources include unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements including 

 

  

we operate a centralized cash management system using zerobalance disbursement accounts therefore our operating cash balance requirements are minimal when cash on hand is not sufficient to fund daily working capital requirements we draw down on our bank lines of credit the weightedaverage interest rate on shortterm debt including commissions paid to commercial paper broker dealers when applicable was 052 during the year ended december 31 2010 and 059 at december 31 2010 

 

during 2010 we issued commercial paper consistently during the first quarter at rates significantly below the shortterm borrowing rates available under our bank credit facility on april 7 standard  poor’s downgraded our shortterm credit rating to a3 from a2 as a result commercial paper rates rose by about 30 basis points 030 percentage points we continued issuing commercial paper through midjuly when the entire outstanding balance was paid with proceeds from our newly executed 4500 million 5year term loan in middecember we utilized the revolving bank line of credit when we retired the 3250 million floating rate notes issued in 2007 

 

during the second or third quarter of 2011 we intend to replace the 15 billion revolving credit facility expires november 2012 with a new multiyear facility at a substantially reduced level the new credit facility would reflect then current market conditions for syndicated bank loan facilities for pricing terms and conditions and financial covenants 

 

 

current maturities and shortterm borrowings 

 

as of december 31 2010 current maturities of longterm debt are 52 million of which 50 million is due as follows 

 

 

 

there are various maturity dates for the remaining 02 million of current maturities we expect to retire this debt using available cash generated from operations by drawing on our bank lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets 

 

 

 

shortterm borrowings at december 31 consisted of the following 

 

 

 

our outstanding bank credit facility which provides 15 billion of liquidity expires november 16 2012 borrowings under this credit facility which are classified as shortterm bear an interest rate based on london interbank offer rate libor plus a credit spread this credit spread was 30 basis points 030 percentage points based on our longterm debt ratings at december 31 2010 

 

as of december 31 2010 

 

  

as a result we had available lines of credit of 11526 million this amount provides a sizable level of borrowing capacity that strengthens our financial flexibility not only does it enable us to fund working capital needs it provides liquidity to fund large expenditures such as longterm debt maturities on a temporary basis without being forced to issue longterm debt at times that are disadvantageous 

 

interest rates referable to borrowings under these credit lines are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions for libor of the 2855 million drawn as of december 31 2010 355 million was borrowed on an overnight basis at 056 1000 million was borrowed for two months at 0581 and 1500 million was borrowed for three months at 0602 our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper our shortterm debt ratingsoutlook as of december 31 2010 were 

 

  

working capital 

 

working capital current assets less current liabilities is a common measure of liquidity used to assess a company’s ability to meet shortterm obligations our working capital is calculated as follows 

 

 

 

the increase in our working capital of 3302 million was primarily the result of a decrease from 2009 to 2010 in current maturities of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings of 3311 million this decrease resulted from the closing of the 4500 million 5year term loan in july 2010 proceeds from the term loan were used to pay outstanding commercial paper and current maturities of longterm debt we continued to focus on maximizing cash generation in 2010 we further reduced

 

 

total inventory current and noncurrent levels by 95 million compared to 2009 for a total reduction of 277 million from peak inventory levels in 2008 this strategy better positions us to increase production and earnings as demand increases the increase in accounts and notes receivable of 498 million was mostly offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities of 469 million 

 

cash flows 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization 

 

 

 

lower net earnings caused the majority of the 2503 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2009 to 2010 we continued to manage the business to generate cash as reflected in the yearoveryear changes in our working capital accounts which generated 372 million of cash in 2010 and 897 million of cash in 2009 cash received associated with gains on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities and accounts for 395 million of the 2503 million yearoveryear decrease in operating cash flows 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 178 million in 2009 compared to 2008 despite a 2178 million decrease in earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization and goodwill impairment changes in working capital generated 897 million of cash in 2009 as compared to using 867 million of cash in 2008 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

net cash used for investing activities totaled 884 million in 2010 compared to 800 million in 2009 an increase of 84 million we continued to closely evaluate the nature and timing of all capital projects in order to conserve cash cash used for the purchase of property plant  equipment totaled 863 million in 2010 down from 1097 million in 2009 and 3532 million in 2008 proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic businesses increased 349 million yearoveryear to 510 million in 2010 these positive cash flows were more than offset by a 336 million increase in payments for businesses acquired and a 333 million decrease in the redemption of mediumterm investments 

 

cash used for investing activities decreased 1090 million to 800 million from 2008 to 2009 in part due to the aforementioned decrease in cash used for the purchase of property plant  equipment as well as a 471 million decrease in payments for businesses acquired these decreases were partially offset by a 2097 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses from 2008 to 2009 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 891 million in 2010 compared to 3610 million during 2009 debt reduction remains a priority use of available cash flows during 2010 despite a significant yearoveryear decline in cash provided by operating activities we reduced total debt by 198 million proceeds from the issuance of the 4500 million 5year term loan in july 2010 were used to pay outstanding commercial paper and current maturities of longterm debt

 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 we reduced our dividend per share to 025 per quarter from 049 per quarter resulting in comparative cash savings of 919 million during 2010 

 

cash used for financing activities increased 901 million from 2008 to 2009 — 2708 million to 3610 million during 2009 proceeds from issuing longterm debt of 3977 million and common stock of 6065 million were primarily used to reduce total debt by 8098 million 

 

capital structure and resources 

 

we pursue attractive investment opportunities and fund acquisitions using internally generated cash or by issuing debt or equity securities we actively manage our capital structure and resources consistent with the policies guidelines and objectives to maximize shareholder wealth as well as to attract equity and fixed income investors who support us by investing in our stock and debt securities our primary goals include 

 

  

maintaining a leadership position in the us aggregates industry has afforded us the opportunity to raise debt and equity capital even in some of the most challenging times in the modern history of us capital markets in july 2010 we executed a 4500 million 5year term loan the proceeds were used in the third quarter to retire commercial paper and current maturities of longterm debt in december 2010 we paid the maturing 3250 million floating rate note with cash on hand and by drawing against our 15 billion revolving credit facility 

 

we maintained the quarterly dividend at a quarterly rate of 025 per share throughout 2010 for a payout of 1278 million we issued 2657864 shares for 1136 million of equity in 2010 for various purposes 

 

  

  

longterm debt 

 

our total debt as a percentage of total capital as of december 31 increased 03 percentage points from 2009 to 2010 

 

 

 

our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions for working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock our bank credit facilities term loan and unsecured bank lines of credit contain a 

 

 

covenant that our percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization total debt as a percentage of total capital may not exceed 65 our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 407 in 2010 compared with 404 in 2009 

 

in the future our total debt as a percentage of total capital will depend on specific investment and financing decisions we have made acquisitions from time to time and will continue to pursue attractive investment opportunities such acquisitions could be funded by using internally generated cash or issuing debt or equity securities 

 

our longterm debt ratingsoutlook as of december 31 2010 were 

 

  

equity 

 

our common stock outstanding increased 27 million shares from january 1 2010 to december 31 2010 

 

 

 

in march 2010 we issued 12 million shares of common stock par value of 1 per share to our qualified pension plan as explained in note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data ” this transaction increased shareholders’ equity by 539 million common stock 12 million and capital in excess of par 527 million 

 

in june 2009 we completed a public offering of common stock par value of 1 per share resulting in the issuance of 132 million shares for net proceeds of 5200 million 

 

as explained in more detail in note 13 “shareholders’ equity” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” common stock issued in connection with business acquisitions were 

 

  

we periodically issue shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k savings and retirement plan to satisfy the plan participants’ elections to invest in our common stock this arrangement provides a means of improving cash flow increasing shareholders’ equity and reducing leverage under this arrangement the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the years ended december 31 were 

 

  

there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 there were 3411416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our 

 

  

standby letters of credit 

 

for a discussion of our standby letters of credit see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

 

cash contractual obligations 

 

we expect to receive a net refund for income taxes of 319 million during 2011 as a result of 2010 overpayments additionally we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings these contracts are discrete and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event excluding the future payments for income taxes and these discrete in nature contracts our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31 2010 are summarized in the table below 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies 

 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis the results of these estimates form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

 

  

we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

 

3 reclamation costs 

 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

5 environmental compliance 

 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 

7 income taxes 

 

1 goodwill and goodwill impairment 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets as of december 31 2010 goodwill represents 37 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our assumptions 

 

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ from those estimates changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a twostep process we have identified 13 reporting units that represent operations or groups of operations one level below our operating segments 

 

step 1 

we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 

 

  

 

 

step 2 

we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill 

 

  

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

 

first we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those units as of the measurement date then we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies finally we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization 

 

results of our impairment tests 

 

the results of our annual impairment tests for 

 

  

for additional information regarding goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

2 impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because longlived assets are material to our total assets as of december 31 2010 property plant  equipment net represents 44 of total assets while other intangible assets net represents 8 of total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment thus an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets 

 

fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

 

during 2010 we recorded a 39 million loss on impairment of longlived assets the loss on impairment was a result of the challenging construction environment which impacted nonstrategic assets across multiple operating segments there were no longlived asset impairments during 2009 and the recorded longlived asset impairments during 2008 were immaterial 

 

 

 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

  

reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

 

reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations 1627 million as of december 31 2010 

 

how we determine fair value of the obligation 

 

to determine the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

 

for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 “asset retirement obligations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

4 pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 

 

  

 

 

how we set our assumptions 

 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds at december 31 2010 the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 455 to 560 

 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2010 we reduced the expected return on plan assets to 800 from 825 

 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience and future expectations at december 31 2010 we increased our projected weightedaverage rate of compensation increase to 350 from 340 

 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 2010 our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits remained at 80 for 2011 decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 2017 and remaining level thereafter 

 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions 

 

 

 

during 2010 the fair value of assets increased from 4936 million to 6303 million due primarily to investment gains and contributions to our qualified pension plans in march and july totaling 738 million additionally in 2010 the pension plans received 216 million related to our investments in westridge capital management inc wcm these receipts included a 66 million release from the courtappointed receiver as a partial distribution and a 150 million insurance settlement for the loss the undistributed balance is held by a courtappointed receiver as a result of allegations of fraud and other violations by principals of a wcm affiliate during 2008 we wrote down the fair value of our assets invested at wcm by 480 million 

 

during 2011 we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately 240 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately 123 million compared to 169 million and 111 million respectively in 2010 the increase in postretirement expense is primarily related to health care reform provisions the increase in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate for the qualified pension plans the increase in pension expense is also due to the 2008 asset losses subject to amortization these increases are offset somewhat by the 2010 pension contributions better than expected asset returns during 2010 and the westridge recovery as a result of our 2010 pension contributions related to plan year 2009 of 725 million in march and 13 million in july we do not expect to make any contributions to the funded pension plans during 2011 assuming actuarial assumptions are realized existing funding credit balances are sufficient to fund projected minimum required contributions until 2013 we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

 

 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

  

our environmental compliance costs include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control facilities the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 

 

how we account for environmental expenditures 

 

to account for environmental expenditures we 

 

  

at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of varying factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur when we can estimate a range of probable loss we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2010 the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 46 million 

 

accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

6 claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels 

 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 

 

 

how we assess the probability of loss 

 

we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

 

for additional information regarding claims and litigation including selfinsurance see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

 

  

how we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities annually we compare the liabilities calculated for our federal state and foreign income tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of the year end income tax provision any adjustments are reflected in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we take into account such factors as 

 

  

if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance we would charge an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings conversely if we were to determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance would be reduced and we would record a benefit to earnings 

 

foreign earnings 

 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore we periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and accordingly whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 

 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are

 

 

identified our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we consider appropriate 

 

before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved a number of years may elapse the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution 

 

we consider resolution for an issue to occur at the earlier of settlement of an examination the expiration of the statute of limitations or when the issue is “effectively settled” as described in accounting standards codification asc topic 740 income taxes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

 

statutory depletion 

 

our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings

we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures thus a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some costsaving andor capacityimprovement aspects likewise a profitadding project is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new locations which occasionally replace facilities at old locations to add product lines to expand the capacity of existing facilities to reduce costs to increase mineral reserves to improve products etc 

 

capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities that are expensed currently including industrial health programs such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels frequently profitadding and major replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental control purposes

 item 7a 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

 

in december 2007 we issued 3250 million of 3year floating variable rate notes that bear interest at 3month libor plus 125 per annum concurrently we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the stated notional amount of 3250 million this swap agreement terminated december 15 2010 coinciding with the maturity of the 3year notes the realized gains and losses upon settlement related to the swap agreement are reflected in interest expense concurrent with the hedged interest payments on the debt at december 31 2009 and 2008 we recognized liabilities included in other accrued liabilities of 112 million and 162 million respectively equal to the fair value of this swap 

 

at december 31 2010 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was 25643 million as compared to a book value of 24328 million the estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on creditadjusted interest rates on us treasury bills notes or bonds as appropriate the fair value estimate is based on information available to management as of the measurement date although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately 1321 million 

 

at december 31 2010 we had 4500 million outstanding under our 5year syndicated term loan established in july 2010 these borrowings bear interest at variable rates — libor plus a spread based on our longterm credit rating at the time of borrowing an increase in libor or a downgrade in our longterm credit rating would increase our borrowing costs for amounts outstanding under these arrangements 

 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a  15e or 15d 15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2010 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

 

we are in the process of replacing our legacy information technology systems we completed the fifth phase of this multiyear project during the fourth quarter of 2010 the new information technology systems were a source for some information presented in this annual report on form 10k we are continuing to work toward the full implementation of the new information technology systems 

 

no other changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting or other factors that could materially affect these controls during the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

 

under management’s supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 

 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 deloitte  touche llp’s report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

 

 

report of independent registered public accounting firm – internal control over financial reporting 

 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the “company” as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 and our report dated february 28 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

summary 

largest us aggregates company by production and revenues 

we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel we are also a major producer of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete and a leading producer of cement in florida 

we estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30 to 35 of the total us aggregates production although the industry leader vulcan’s total us market share is less than 10 other publicly traded companies among the ten largest us aggregates producers include cemex crh heidelberg holcim lafarge mdu resources and martin marietta materials the us aggregates industry is highly fragmented with approximately 5000 companies managing more than 10000 operations this industry structure provides considerable opportunities for consolidation and it is common for companies in the industry to grow by entering new markets or enhancing their market positions by acquiring existing facilities since our inception as a public company in 1956 we have grown mainly through mergers and acquisitions 

reserves are essential to longterm success in the aggregates business we have 142 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable reserves 

reporting segments 

we have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix and concrete and cement

strategy 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the us economy our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates aggregates are used in all types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete our materials are used to build the roads tunnels bridges and airports that connect us and to build the hospitals churches shopping centers and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy

demand for construction aggregates generally correlates with changes in population growth household formation and employment we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly

large highgrowth markets — we have aggregates operations in 9 of the 10 metropolitan areas that demographers expect to have the largest absolute growth in population over the next decade vulcanserved states are predicted to have 74 of the total growth in the us population to 2020 our top five revenue producing states are predicted to have 48 of the total growth in the us population to 2020 this position gives us strategically located reserves where they are most needed additionally many of these reserves are located in areas where zoning and permitting laws have made opening new quarries increasingly difficult 

diversified regional exposure helps insulate vulcan from variations in local weather and economies 

profitable growth

effective land management 

responsible land management is important to vulcan’s success not only with respect to social responsibility but also as a component of our business strategy good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources it also requires longterm planning because mining ultimately is an interim use of the land we therefore strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value created when properties can be reused at the conclusion of mining we continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future 

aggregates 

attractive us market fundamentals for aggregates 

there are a number of factors that affect the us aggregates industry and our business 

  

primarily local markets 

aggregates have a high weighttovalue ratio and in most cases must be produced near where they are used or transportation can cost more than the materials exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available aggregates we serve these markets from inland quarries — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on mexico’s yucatan peninsula we transport aggregates from mexico to the us principally on our panamaxclass selfunloading ships 

location and quality of reserves are critical 

vulcan currently has 142 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable reserves the bulk of these reserves are located in areas we expect to have greater than average rates of growth in population jobs and households requiring new infrastructure housing offices schools and other development all of which require aggregates for construction zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets these restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas but they could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 

demand cycles characterized by short steep declines followed by solid recovery 

longterm growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population jobs and households while short and mediumterm demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles the declines have historically been followed by strong recovery with each peak establishing a new historical high in comparison to all other recent demand cycles the current downturn has been unusually steep and long it is therefore difficult to predict the timing or strength of any future recovery 

diverse markets 

large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and privatesector construction projects — highways water and sewer systems industrial manufacturing facilities residential and nonresidential buildings aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast 

page 5 

estimated us aggregates demand by endmarket 

  

source internal estimates 

highway construction is the most aggregatesintensive form of construction and residential construction is the least intensive a dollar of spending for highway construction is estimated to consume seven times the quantity of aggregates consumed by a dollar of spending for residential construction other nonhighway infrastructure markets like airports sewer and waste disposal or water supply plants and utilities also require large quantities of aggregates in their foundations and structures these types of infrastructurerelated construction can be four times more aggregatesintensive than residential construction generally nonresidential buildings require two to three times as much aggregates per dollar of spending as a new home with most of the aggregates used in the foundations building structure and parking lots 

highly fragmented industry 

the us aggregates industry is composed of approximately 5000 companies managing more than 10000 operations this fragmented structure provides considerable opportunities for consolidation and it is common for companies in the industry to enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities 

relatively stable demand from the public sector 

publicly funded construction activity historically has been more stable than privately funded construction public construction also has been less cyclical than private construction and it requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending private construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more subject to general economic cycles than public construction publicly funded projects particularly highways roads and bridges tend to receive consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles 

limited product substitution 

with few exceptions there are no practical substitutes for quality aggregates in some areas typically urban locations recycled concrete has limited applications as a lowercost alternative to virgin aggregates however many types of construction projects cannot be serviced by recycled concrete but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performancebased criteria for durability strength and other qualities 

page 6 

widely used in downstream products 

in the production process aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses two downstream products that utilize aggregates are asphalt mix and readymixed concrete aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 78 of readymixed concrete by weight 

flexible production capabilities 

the production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and through a series of screens separated into various sizes depending on ultimate use the production does not require high startup costs like continuous process manufacturing production capacity can be flexed efficiently by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand for example we reduced production during 2009 in response to the economic downturn and have the capacity to quickly increase production as economic conditions and demand improve 

no raw material inputs 

unlike much industrial manufacturing the aggregates industry does not require raw material inputs beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves stone sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources production does require the use of explosives hydrocarbon fuels and electric power 

our markets 

our markets are local yet national because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates we focus on the areas of the us with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand thus our distribution facilities are located in the markets they serve 

public sector 

public sector construction includes spending by federal state and local governments for highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and other public construction projects construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2009 publicly funded construction accounted for 50 of our total aggregates shipments 

generally public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and often is supported by multiyear legislation and programs the federal transportation bill is a principal source of federal funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects for over two decades the federal funding component of these projects has been provided through a series of sixyear bills the multiyear aspect of these bills is critically important because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute longterm and complex highway projects federal highway spending has been governed by a sixyear authorization bill the most recent covering fiscal years 20042009 and annual budget appropriations using funds largely taken from the federal highway trust fund this trust fund receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies the level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies in 2009 approximately 27 of our aggregates sales by volume were used in public highway construction projects 

the most recent federal transportation bill known as safetealu expired on september 30 2009 following the expiration congress has yet to extend the legislation or pass a replacement bill as a result funds for highway construction are being provided by a series of relatively short continuing resolutions and at funding levels considerably below what would have been available had congress extended the provisions of safetealu this uncertainty compelled many states to postpone highway maintenance and improvement projects 

congress currently is working to finalize a “jobs bill” that includes provisions to restore highway funding at previously budgeted levels through the end of 2010 this action would be funded by the transfer of approximately 20 billion in interest owed from the general fund to the highway trust fund if passed this legislation would be an important first step on the path to longterm highway funding stability that will occur with the ultimate passage of a multiyear highway bill 

page 7 

there is significant need for additional and ongoing investments in the nation’s infrastructure in 2009 a report by the american society of civil engineers asce gave our nation’s infrastructure an overall grade of “d” and estimated that an investment of 22 trillion over a fiveyear period is needed for improvements while the needs are clear the source of funding for infrastructure improvements is not in its report the asce suggests that all levels of government owners and users need to renew their commitment to infrastructure investments in all categories and that all available financing options should be explored and debated 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was signed into law on february 17 2009 to create jobs and restore economic growth through among other things the modernization of america’s infrastructure and improving its energy resources included in the 787 billion of economic stimulus funding is 50 to 60 billion of heavy construction including 275 billion for highways and bridges this federal funding for highways and bridges unlike typical federal funding programs for infrastructure will not require states to provide matching funds the nature of the projects that are being funded by arra generally will require considerable quantities of aggregates also we expect construction activity will increase due to spending allocated to the following areas 11 billion for airports 84 billion for mass transit 80 billion for high speed rail 46 billion for the army corps of engineers 60 billion for water and sewer projects and 42 billion for united states department of defense facilities other funding and tax relief that could generate additional demand for our products includes 64 billion to clean nuclear weapon sites 60 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy 200 billion for renewable energy tax incentives 63 billion to states for energy efficiency and clean energy grants 88 billion for the renovation of schools and 66 billion for a first time homebuyer credit of 8000 

economic stimulus funds of 275 billion designated for highway projects under arra buoyed contract awards for highways in the second half of 2009 through december 2009 the federal highway administration reported approximately 15 billion of stimulusrelated highway projects under construction with 56 billion of these stimulus funds having been paid to contractors for work performed during this same period vulcanserved states which were apportioned 55 more funds than other states lagged the rest of the country in awarding and starting stimulusrelated highway construction projects these differences in awarding projects and spending patterns result in part from the types of projects planned and the proportion suballocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming 

despite the failure of congress to pass a fullyfunded extension of safetealu the previous highway authorization that expired on september 30 2009 contract awards for highways in the fourth quarter increased 9 from the same period in the prior year moreover contract awards for highway projects in vulcanserved states increased 13 from the prior year fourth quarter versus a 2 increase in other states we are encouraged by the increased award activity and are optimistic that stimulusrelated highway projects in vulcanserved states after a slow start are now moving forward and will increase demand for our products in 2010 

our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the 50 to 60 billion of stimulusrelated heavy construction including significant remaining portions of the 275 billion for highways and bridges we expect 2010 to be the largest year of stimulusrelated highway demand for our products followed by another solid year in 2011 

private sector 

this market includes both nonresidential buildings and residential construction and is more cyclical than public construction in 2009 privatelyfunded construction accounted for 50 of our total aggregates shipments 

private nonresidential construction includes a wide array of project types and generally is more aggregates intensive per dollar of construction spending than residential construction but less aggregates intensive than public construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction is generally driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends the growth of the private workforce creates a demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals churches and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm’s ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing 

page 8 

the majority of residential construction is for singlefamily houses with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises a small portion of the housing demand household formations in vulcan’s markets have grown faster than the us as a whole in the last 10 years during that time us household growth was only 11 compared to 14 in our markets construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of driveways or parking lots 

us housing starts peaked in 2005 at just over 2 million units by the end of 2009 housing starts had declined to approximately 600000 units a 70 decline from the most recent peak and well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually multifamily starts have remained weak however in november 2009 singlefamily housing starts increased 28 as compared to the same period in 2008 breaking a string of 43 consecutive months of yearoveryear declines we believe this data while not necessarily reflective of a longterm trend is encouraging lower home prices attractive mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale provide some optimism in singlefamily housing construction in 2010 and beyond 

consistent with past cycles of private sector construction private nonresidential construction remained strong after residential construction peaked in 2005 however in late 2007 contract awards for nonresidential buildings peaked in 2008 contract awards in the us declined 24 from the prior year and in 2009 fell sharply declining 56 from 2008 levels contract awards for stores and office buildings were the weakest categories of nonresidential construction in 2009 declining more than 60 from the prior year 

other markets 

we sell ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad track we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways in addition stone also can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder also can be sold as agricultural lime 

our competitive advantage 

we are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the united states the aggregates market is highly fragmented with many small independent producers therefore depending on the market we may compete with large national or regional firms as well as relatively small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value markets generally are local in nature thus the cost to deliver product to the location where it is used is an important competitive factor 

demographic trends — 2010 to 2020 

forecasted compound annual growth rate 

source woods  poole economics and moody’s economycom 

we focus on serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future a market often consists of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties where 

page 9 

transportation from the producing location to the customer is by truck only approximately 84 of our total aggregates shipments are delivered locally by truck sales yards and other distribution facilities located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets that do not have locally available sources of aggregates 

zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries any such regulations while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations 

we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico nondomestic sales and longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

asphalt mix and concrete 

we produce and sell asphalt mix and readymixed concrete primarily in our midatlantic florida southwestern and western markets additionally we produce and sell in a limited number of these markets other concrete products such as block prestressed and precast beams and resell purchased building materials for use with readymixed concrete and concrete block 

this segment relies on our reserves of aggregates functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations or as a means of distributing products produced by our aggregates and cement businesses aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix and in readymixed concrete comprising approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 78 of readymixed concrete by weight our asphalt mix and concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates requirements from our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 

customers for our asphalt mix and concrete segment are generally served locally from our production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly delivery typically is confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles from the producing facility our asphalt mix and concrete segment constituted approximately 30 of our sales dollars before the elimination of intersegment sales in 2009 compared to 32 in 2008 and 24 in 2007 

readymixed concrete production also requires cement in the florida market cement requirements for readymixed concrete production is supplied substantially by our cement segment in other markets we purchase cement from thirdparty suppliers the asphalt production process requires liquid asphalt which we purchase entirely from thirdparty producers we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

cement 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk form and bags to the concrete products industry our tampa florida facility imports and exports cement and slag some of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the cement is blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements that are then sold the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form our port manatee florida facility imports cement clinker that is ground into bulk cement and sold our brooksville florida plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics and joint compound industries 

the cement segment’s largest single customer is our readymixed concrete operations within the asphalt mix and concrete segment 

page 10 

during 2009 we substantially completed the project to expand our newberry cement facility to double its production capacity to 16 million tons per year this plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility these limestone reserves total 1939 million tons the new capacity is expected to become fully operational in 2010 

our brooksville calcium facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry the calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total approximately 66 million tons 

other business related items 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors our financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year because seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products normally the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter further our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending primarily in the private sector the levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

customers 

no material part of our business is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business in 2009 our top five customers accounted for 42 of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 13 of our total revenues our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although approximately 45 to 55 of our aggregates shipments have historically gone into publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments 

research and development costs 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at our technical service center in birmingham alabama in general these efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products and in supporting customers in pursuing the most efficient use of our products we spent 15 million in 2009 and 2008 and 16 million in 2007 on research and development activities 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2010 and 2011 will be approximately 81 million and 72 million respectively 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk and including a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment

our incurrence of additional debt to finance a portion of the florida rock merger significantly increased our interest expense financial leverage and debt service requirements — we incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger incurrence of this debt significantly increased our leverage and caused downgrades in our credit rating there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows 

there are various financial and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

construction both commercial and residential is dependent upon the overall us economy which remains weak and could weaken further — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall us economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions significant merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting constraints on credit availability the commercial construction market declined in 2008 and 2009 due mostly to the recession and disruptions in credit availability also continued weakness in the residential construction market negatively affected the commercial construction market the residential construction market further softened in 2009 as a result of the housing market downturn the overall weakness in the economy and the uncertainty in the credit markets could cause commercial and residential construction to remain at low levels or weaken further 

the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and in turn the housing market could continue to negatively affect demand for our products — in most of our markets particularly florida and california sales volumes have been negatively impacted by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and a significant decline in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until the slowdown in residential construction improves 

a decline in public sector construction and reductions in governmental funding could adversely affect our operations and results — in 2009 50 of our sales volume of construction aggregates was made to contractors on publicly funded construction projects if as a result of a loss of federal funding a protracted delay by congress to extend or replace the multiyear federal transportation bill that expired on september 30 2009 or a significant reduction in state or federal budgets spending on publicly funded construction were to be reduced significantly our earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected further any delays in expenditure of stimulus funds designated for highways and other public work projects pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 could negatively impact our earnings for 2010 

difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows — the current credit environment has negatively affected the us economy and demand for our products commercial and residential construction could continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations of capital projects 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on our accounts receivable from our customers we have experienced payment delays from some of our customers during this economic downturn 

the credit environment could limit our ability to issue commercial paper additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms interest rates on new issuances of longterm public debt in the market may increase due to higher credit and risk premiums there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

page 13 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding shortterm debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper to the extent it is available to us while it is our objective to maintain our credit ratings at investment grade levels we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while we believe that we will continue to have adequate credit available to meet our needs there can be no assurance of such credit availability 

weather can materially affect our quarterly results — almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand since their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets however in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies some of which are more vertically integrated than we are this results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows in certain markets vertically integrated competitors have acquired some asphalt mix and readymixed concrete customers and this trend may continue to accelerate 

our longterm success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas — construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop so our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

our future growth is dependent in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves credit and financing availability could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law impact our business — our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts there is the inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business especially from an environmental standpoint these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with zoning and environmental laws and regulations stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

page 14 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for the extraction and production of construction aggregates profitability as measured in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales margins can be greatly impacted due to changes in volume 

our products are transported by truck rail barge or ship primarily by thirdparty providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings — the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise this could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current significant legal proceedings see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change including pending us legislation that if enacted would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits among other provisions in addition the environmental protection agency epa has for the first time required large emitters of greenhouse gases to collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions and has proposed a permitting process for large emitters we have determined that our newberry cement plant would likely be subject to this permitting under the regulations as currently proposed these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain any such “capandtrade” 

page 15 

system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operation or cash flows 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the specific geographic location of our facilities and operations these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels the impact of these laws and regulations could also potentially increase our energy costs these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill reclamation costs pension and other postretirement benefits environmental compliance claims and litigation including selfinsurance and income taxes although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

aggregates 

as the largest us producer of construction aggregates we have operating facilities across the us and in mexico and the bahamas we principally serve markets in 21 states the district of columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in mexico and the bahamas our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the us that are predicted to experience the most significant growth in population households and employment these three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates 

  

our current estimate of 142 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects a decrease of 02 billion tons on a comparable basis from the estimate at the end of 2008 estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and subject to permit or other restrictions 

proven or measured reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops trenches and quarry faces the grade andor quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size shape depth and mineral content of reserves are wellestablished probable or indicated reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade andor quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable though not drilled geologic evidence the degree of assurance although lower than that for proven reserves is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained leases zoning permits reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas depths and lengths of time allowed for mining stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities 

page 17 

berms and overburden or waste storage among other requirements and restrictions our reserve estimates take into account these factors technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis for example excessive overburden or weathered rock rock quality issues excessive mining depths groundwater issues overlying wetlands endangered species habitats and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable in addition computations for reserves inplace are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste 

the 142 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2009 include reserves at inactive and greenfield undeveloped sites we reported proven and probable reserves of 133 billion tons at the end of 2008 that determination excluded reserves at inactive and greenfield sites that otherwise qualified as proven or probable reserves and could be economically and legally extracted including inactive and greenfield sites proven and probable reserves at the end of 2008 were 144 billion tons this table presents by division the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of december 31 2009 and the types of facilities operated 

 

 

 of the 142 billion tons of aggregates reserves 80 billion tons or 56 are located on owned land and 62 billion tons or 44 are located on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2010 to 2159 most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion 

the following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites none of our aggregates facilities contributes more than 5 to our net sales

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business

financial highlights for 2009 

 

in 2009 we faced declining demand for our products due to economic conditions that resulted in a sharp slowdown in the private construction market new home construction declined to historically low levels while tight credit and business failures contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings particularly stores and offices construction activity funded by the public sector typically less affected in economic cycles was weak as 

page 23 

well in 2009 declining state revenues reduced the amount of funds available at the state level for public construction projects the effects of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra were helpful but the bulk of funds for transportation infrastructure under this act will be spent in 2010 and 2011 the positive effects of arra spending in 2009 were somewhat offset by the failure of congress to extend or reauthorize the most recent multiyear federal transportation bill which expired on september 30 2009 as a result funds for highway construction are being provided by a series of relatively short continuing resolutions and at funding levels considerably below what would have been available had congress extended the provisions of safetealu this uncertainty compelled many states to postpone highway maintenance and improvement projects 

arra includes economic stimulus funding of 50 to 60 billion for heavy construction projects that use our products including 275 billion for highways and bridges vulcanserved states were apportioned 55 more funds than other states with california texas and florida receiving nearly 23 of the total for highways and bridges beginning in midyear 2009 highway construction awards were buoyed by stimulusrelated funding through december 2009 the federal highway administration reported that approximately 85 of the 275 billion of funding for highway and bridge projects had been obligated 15 billion was under construction and 56 billion had been paid to contractors for work performed during this period most vulcanserved states lagged the rest of the country in awarding and starting stimulusrelated highway construction projects these differences in awarding projects and spending patterns were due in part to the types of projects planned and to the proportion suballocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming however in the fourth quarter contract awards for highways in vulcanserved states increased 13 from 2008 compared to a 2 increase in other states this provides some evidence that construction activity in vulcanserved states will improve in 2010 

despite these challenging conditions we have worked diligently to manage effectively those aspects of the business that we are able to control we were able to achieve modest price increases which helped offset lower sales volumes we reduced selling administrative and general expenses by 210 million compared to 2008 we adjusted production levels to meet demand and as a result employment levels across the company were 12 lower than in 2008 these effective cost management efforts have allowed us to maximize cash flow in a period of unprecedented and prolonged economic downturn 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

free cash flow and ebitda are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap thus they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by gaap these metrics are presented for the convenience of investment professionals that use such metrics in their analysis and to provide our shareholders with an understanding of the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions these metrics are often used by the investment community as indicators of a company’s ability to incur and service debt we internally use free cash flow ebitda and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources internally reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below 

free cash flow 

free cash flow deducts purchases of property plant  equipment from net cash provided by operating activities

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda is an acronym for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we adjusted ebitda in 2008 to exclude the noncash charge for goodwill impairment 

 

 

results of operations 

on november 16 2007 we acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of florida rock industries inc a leading producer of construction aggregates cement readymixed concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and midatlantic states the results of operations discussed below include florida rock for the periods from november 16 2007 through december 31 2007 and the full calendar years 2008 and 2009 we include intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment revenue at the product line level net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations we discuss separately our discontinued operations which consist of our former chemicals business 

page 25 

consolidated operating results 

 

the economic downturn and other external factors affecting the construction industry continued to present challenges for our business continued weakness in private construction activity both residential and nonresidential and the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of either a formal extension or reauthorization of the multiyear federal highway program offset the benefits of stimulusrelated construction activity in 2009 furthermore construction activity on stimulusrelated highway projects varied widely in vulcanserved states and in certain key states lagged the rest of the country 

we continue to run the business in a costefficient manner with a focus on effectively managing those aspects of cost we can control or influence in order to maximize our cash generation during the economic downturn our efforts contributed to reductions in cash fixed costs in our operations as well as reductions in overhead expenses the average selling price for aggregates increased 3 in 2009 despite lower shipments reflecting attractive pricing fundamentals of our business the higher selling price for aggregates reflects increased market prices as well as proportionately greater levels of higher priced aggregates used for highway construction as a result of these actions the cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in 2009 nearly matched the record level achieved in 2008 the increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover 

the 2008 results include an estimated 2276 million or 205 per diluted share after tax goodwill impairment charge for our cement segment which is located in florida the 2008 results also include net earnings per diluted share of 034 from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition results in 2007 include net earnings per diluted share of 024 from the sale of real estate in california additionally higher energyrelated costs lowered earnings by 086 per diluted share in 2008 as compared to 2007

we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level we have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix and concrete and cement management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 

aggregates 

revenues and gross profits in millions 

page 27 

 

our yearoveryear aggregates shipments declined 26 in 2009 12 in 2008 and 9 in 2007 most of our geographic markets reported doubledigit percentage declines in aggregates volumes in 2009 pricing for our products remained strong and helped to partially offset the earnings effect of lower volumes our yearoveryear pricing improved 3 in 2009 7 in 2008 and 13 in 2007 we are tightly managing plant operating costs and overhead expenses as we continue to adjust our cost structure to match weak demand we have limited operating hours streamlined our work force and focused on achieving production efficiencies at reduced operating rates in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products as a result our cash earnings per ton of aggregates while essentially flat compared to 2008 and 2007 is 45 higher than the 2005 level which was a year of peak demand for aggregates we will continue to manage controllable costs aggressively and to focus on cash margins and earnings 

asphalt mix and concrete 

revenues and gross profits in millions 

shipments of asphalt mix declined 22 in 2009 compared to 2008 and declined by 9 in 2008 compared to 2007 asphalt materials margins were higher than the prior year as slightly lower selling prices for asphalt mix were more than offset by a 29 decline in the costs for liquid asphalt readymixed concrete shipments declined by 32 in 2009 from 2007 to 2008 the sharp increase in readymixed concrete shipments resulted from the inclusion of a full year of sales from the acquired florida rock concrete operations readymixed concrete pricing remained relatively flat during the threeyear period 

page 28 

cement 

revenues and gross profits in millions 

cement earnings declined from last year because of weaker sales volumes slightly offset by lower energy costs cement pricing declined 1 year over year we acquired the cement segment in november 2007 as part of the florida rock acquisition so we reported no comparable revenues or earnings for the first ten months of 2007 

selling administrative and general expenses in millions 

selling administrative and general expenses sag include 85 million in 2009 and 105 million in 2008 of expenses for property donations recorded at fair value the gains from these donations which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value are included in gain on sale of property plant  equipment in the consolidated statements of earnings excluding the effect of these property donations sag in 2009 declined 190 million or 55 the yearoveryear decline is due mostly to reductions in employeerelated expenses which more than offset a yearoveryear increase in project costs related to the replacement of legacy it systems employment levels across vulcan are down 12 from the prior year the sag increase in 2008 over 2007 was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses for the former florida rock businesses employment levels in 2008 were down 14 from 2007 

goodwill impairment 

there were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2009 and 2007 during 2008 we recorded a 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement segment in florida representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit we acquired these operations as part of the florida rock transaction in november 2007 for additional details regarding this impairment see the goodwill and goodwill impairment critical accounting policy 

page 29 

gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses net in millions 

the 2009 gains were primarily related to sales and donations of real estate mostly in california included in the 2008 gains was a 738 million pretax gain for quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition the 2007 gain includes a 438 million pretax gain on the sale of real estate in california 

interest expense in millions 

the increase in interest expense in 2009 and 2008 was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of florida rock excluding capitalized interest credits gross interest expense for 2009 was 1860 million compared to 1871 million in 2008 and 533 million in 2007 

income taxes 

our income tax benefit provision for continuing operations for the years ended december 31 are shown below 

 

the change in our 2009 tax provision resulted from the relatively greater effect of certain items such as statutory depletion undistributed earnings from foreign operations loss on the sale of the stock of a subsidiary and charitable contributions of property coupled with the significantly lower level of earnings the 2008 provision included the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge the 2008 income tax provision for continuing operations was 968 million or an effective tax rate of 295 a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35 to our effective tax rates for 2009 2008 and 2007 is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

discontinued operations 

pretax operating results from discontinued operations were a gain of 186 million in 2009 compared to losses of 41 million in 2008 and 193 million in 2007 the 2009 pretax gain from discontinued operations resulted primarily from settlements with two of our insurers in the modesto perchloroethylene cases which are associated with our former chemicals business these settlements resulted in pretax gains of 235 million the insurance proceeds and associated gain represent a partial recovery of legal and settlement costs recognized in prior years the 

page 30 

2008 and 2007 pretax losses from discontinued operations and the remaining results from 2009 reflect charges primarily related to general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals businesses for additional information regarding discontinued operations see note 2 “discontinued operations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operating activities our additional financial resources include unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets we believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements in the future including debt service obligations cash contractual obligations capital expenditures dividend payments and potential future acquisitions 

we operate a centralized cash management system using zerobalance disbursement accounts therefore our operating cash balance requirements are minimal when cash on hand is not sufficient to fund daily working capital requirements we issue commercial paper or draw down on our bank lines of credit during 2009 bank borrowings generally were more expensive than commercial paper since july 2009 we have funded all our shortterm cash needs by issuing commercial paper ranging in maturity from overnight to 91 days the amount outstanding during the second half of 2009 averaged 2798 million the weighted average allin interest rate including commissions paid to commercial paper broker dealers and the cost of backup lines of credit was 059 during that period and was 049 at yearend 

current maturities and shortterm borrowings 

as of december 31 2009 we have 3854 million of current maturities of longterm debt that are due as follows 

 

there are various maturity dates for the remaining 04 million we expect to retire this debt using available cash generated from operations by issuing commercial paper or drawing on our line of credit or by accessing the capital markets 

net shortterm borrowings at december 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars 

 

our outstanding bank credit facility which provides 15 billion of liquidity expires november 16 2012 borrowings under this credit facility which are classified as shortterm bear an interest rate based on london interbank offer rate libor plus a credit spread this credit spread was 30 basis points 03 based on our longterm debt ratings at december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 there were no borrowings under the 15 billion line of credit 2365 million was used to support outstanding commercial paper and 592 million was used to back outstanding letters of credit resulting in available lines of credit of 12043 million this amount provides a 

page 31 

sizable level of borrowing capacity that strengthens our financial flexibility not only does it enable us to fund working capital needs it provides liquidity to fund large expenditures such as longterm debt maturities on a temporary basis without being forced to issue longterm debt at times that are disadvantageous interest rates referable to borrowings under these credit lines are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions for libor our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper

working capital 

working capital current assets less current liabilities is a common measure of liquidity used to assess a company’s ability to meet shortterm obligations our total current liabilities exceeded total current assets as follows 

 

the 6558 million improvement in working capital reflects our focus on generating and conserving cash during 2009 we managed production of aggregates to levels below current demand resulting in reduced levels of inventory while lowering inventory levels negatively impacted our earnings it generated cash accounts and notes receivable decreased 890 million from 2008 to 2009 resulting from a 26 yearoveryear decline in net sales despite the weak economy and lower sales the collection period on our accounts receivable was relatively flat from 2008 to 2009 proceeds from longterm debt issued in february and proceeds from stock issued in june were primarily used to reduce shortterm borrowings by 8460 million 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization and goodwill impairment 

 

net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization and goodwill impairment were 4249 million in 2009 compared to 6426 million in 2008 despite the 2177 million decrease in earnings before these noncash deductions we were able to increase cash provided by operating activities by 178 million in 2009 compared to 2008 our efforts to manage the business to generate cash are reflected in favorable yearoveryear changes in our working capital accounts changes in working capital accounts generated 897 million of cash in 2009 as compared to using 867 million of cash in 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2729 million in 2008 compared to 2007 net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation depletion accretion and amortization and goodwill impairment accounted for 797 million of the decrease reductions in trade payables and other accruals accounted for an additional 1026 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities 

page 32 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities totaled 800 million in 2009 compared to 1890 million in 2008 a decrease of 1090 million we closely evaluated the nature and timing of all capital projects in an effort to conserve cash the generally good condition of our property plant  equipment afforded us the opportunity to delay expending replacement capital without reducing operating efficiency cash used for the purchase of property plant  equipment totaled 1097 million in 2009 down 2435 million from 2008 these cash savings were partially offset by a yearoveryear reduction in proceeds from the sale of businesses of 2097 million cash used for investing activities in 2007 of 36543 million was largely attributable to the acquisition of florida rock which required cash payments of 32390 million net of cash acquired and including our direct transaction costs 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 3610 million in 2009 compared to 2708 million during 2008 debt reduction and achieving target debt ratios remain a priority use of cash flows during 2009 proceeds from issuing longterm debt of 3946 million net of debt issuance costs and common stock of 6065 million were primarily used to reduce total debt by 8098 million we reduced our dividend per share beginning in the third quarter of 2009 from 049 per quarter to 025 per quarter resulting in 433 million of cash savings that further contributed to debt reduction during 2008 proceeds from issuing longterm debt of 9434 million were used to pay down shortterm borrowings drawn during 2007 to fund the florida rock acquisition refer to note 6 “credit facilities shortterm borrowings and longterm debt” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion 

capital structure and resources 

we actively manage our capital structure and resources consistent with the policies guidelines and objectives listed below in order to maximize shareholder wealth as well as to attract equity and fixed income investors who support us by investing in our stock and debt securities we pursue attractive investment opportunities and fund acquisitions using internally generated cash or by issuing debt or equity securities 

 

being a leader in the us aggregates industry and maintaining investment grade credit ratings has afforded us the opportunity to raise debt and equity capital even in some of the most challenging times in the modern history of us capital markets during 2009 we completed two financing transactions in the face of unsettled economic conditions and during a period of very weak markets for our products these transactions strengthened our balance sheet and improved our financial flexibility in february we issued 400 million of debt capital using the proceeds to retire 250 million of 10year notes that matured april 1 2009 and increase liquidity in june we completed a public equity offering that was significantly oversubscribed and yielded 5200 million in net proceeds proceeds were used to reduce leverage to a level closer to our target debt to equity ratio of 35 to 40 at the same time as our equity offering we reduced the quarterly dividend for the first time in our history the lower quarterly dividend will reduce annualized cash outflows by about 120 million we issued an additional 866 million of equity in 2009 to fund the acquisition of two quarries and to fund share requirements in our 401k plans 

page 33 

longterm debt 

the calculations of our total debt as a percentage of total capital and the weightedaverage stated interest rates on our longterm debt as of december 31 are summarized below amounts in millions except percentages 

 

 our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock the percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization total debt as a percentage of total capital as defined in our bank credit facility agreements must be less than 65 in the future our total debt as a percentage of total capital will depend on specific investment and financing decisions we have made acquisitions from time to time and will continue to pursue attractive investment opportunities such acquisitions could be funded by using internally generated cash or issuing debt or equity securities 

longterm debt ratingsoutlook 

 

equity 

common stock activity is summarized below in thousands of shares 

 

in june 2009 we completed a public offering of common stock 1 par value resulting in the issuance of 132 million shares for net proceeds of 5200 million 

as explained in more detail in note 13 “shareholders’ equity” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” common stock issued in connection with business acquisitions were 08 million shares in 2009 12 million shares in 2008 and 126 million shares in 2007 

page 34 

during 2009 we issued 11 million shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401k savings and retirement plans and received proceeds of 527 million these issuances were made to satisfy the plan participants’ elections to invest in vulcan’s common stock this arrangement provides a means of improving cash flow increasing shareholders’ equity and reducing leverage 

there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the number of shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors was 3411416 as of december 31 2009 

cash contractual obligations 

our obligations to make future payments under contracts as of december 31 2009 are summarized in the table below in millions of dollars 

 

 we estimate cash requirements for income taxes in 2010 to be 235 million including the effect of refunds from overpayments during 2009 

we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings these contracts are discrete in nature and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event the future payments under these contracts are not included in the table set forth above 

page 35 

standby letters of credit 

we provide certain third parties with irrevocable standby letters of credit in the normal course of business we use commercial banks to issue standby letters of credit to back our obligations to pay or perform when required to do so pursuant to the requirements of an underlying agreement the standby letters of credit listed below are cancelable only at the option of the beneficiaries who are authorized to draw drafts on the issuing bank up to the face amount of the standby letter of credit in accordance with its terms since banks consider letters of credit as contingent extensions of credit we are required to pay a fee until they expire or are canceled substantially all of our standby letters of credit have a oneyear term and are renewable annually at the option of the beneficiary 

our standby letters of credit as of december 31 2009 are summarized in the table below in millions of dollars 

 

of the total 624 million outstanding standby letters of credit 592 million is backed by our 15000 million bank credit facility which expires november 16 2012 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations financial position liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and goodwill impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment as of december 31 2009 goodwill totaled 30940 million and represents 36 of total assets 

page 36 

how we test goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a twostep process we have identified 13 reporting units representing operations or groups of operations one level below our operating segments 

step one 

compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 

if the fair value exceeds its carrying value the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss if any 

step two 

compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

how we determine carrying value and fair value 

the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those reporting units as of the measurement date we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization 

our assumptions 

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ materially from those estimates any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects which may result from a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability capital requirements and the discount rate the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for longterm demand and pricing in our industry estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model 

results of our 2009 impairment tests 

historically we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january 1 in order to better align our annual goodwill impairment test with our budgeting and forecasting process to meet the accelerated reporting deadlines and to provide adequate time to complete the analysis each year during the fourth quarter of 2009 we changed the date on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment test from january 1 to november 1 we believe that this accounting change is an alternative method of applying an accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of november 1 2009 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of january 1 2009 indicated that the carrying value of our cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value based on the results of the second step of the impairment test we 

page 37 

concluded that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december 31 2008 

for additional information regarding goodwill see note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as of december 31 2009 property plant  equipment net represents 45 of total assets and other intangible assets net represents 8 of total assets an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see note 4 “property plant  equipment” and note 18 “goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 ”financial statements and supplementary data” 

reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

in determining the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility 

the carrying value of these obligations is 1678 million as of december 31 2009 for additional information regarding reclamation obligations referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations see note 17 “asset retirement obligations” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

page 38 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds at december 31 2009 the discount rate for our plans ranged from 52 to 60 an analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2009 the expected return on plan assets remained 825 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2009 the inflation component of the assumed rate of compensation increase remained at 225 in addition based on future expectations of merit and productivity increases the weightedaverage component of the salary increase assumption decreased to 115 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 2009 our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits remains at 85 for 2010 decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 2017 and remaining level thereafter 

page 39 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions in millions of dollars 

 

during 2009 the fair value of assets increased from 4190 million to 4936 million due primarily to investment returns and contributions to the pension plans of 276 million the fair value of assets reflects a 480 million writedown recognized in 2008 for certain assets invested at westridge capital management inc wcm in february 2009 the new york district court appointed a receiver over wcm due to allegations of fraud and other violations of federal commodities and securities laws by principles of wcm in light of these allegations we reassessed the fair value of our investments at wcm 

during 2010 we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately 185 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately 113 million compared to 162 million and 107 million respectively in 2009 the increase in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in discount rate and for the qualified pension plans the 2008 asset losses subject to amortization normal cash payments made for pension benefits in 2010 under the unfunded plans are estimated at 41 million we expect to make contributions totaling 725 million to the funded pension plans during 2010 it is anticipated that these contributions along with existing funding credits are sufficient to fund projected minimum required contributions until the 2013 plan year we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration 

for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “benefit plans” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

environmental compliance 

our environmental compliance costs include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control facilities the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures for current operations or for future revenues consistent with our capitalization policy we expense expenditures for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues we accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of varying factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur 

when a range of probable loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2009 the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was 50 million accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental 

page 40 

compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 “accrued environmental remediation costs” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate 

we file various federal state and foreign income tax returns including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities annually we compare the liabilities calculated for our federal state and foreign income tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of the year end income tax provision any adjustments are reflected in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we take into account such factors as prior earnings history expected future taxable income mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made conversely if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 

foreign earnings 

us income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore we periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and accordingly whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 

page 41 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 

a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

statutory depletion 

our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 created a new deduction for certain domestic production activities as described in section 199 of the internal revenue code generally this deduction subject to certain limitations was set at 6 for 2007 through 2009 and increases to 9 in 2010 and thereafter the estimated impact of this deduction on the 2009 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates is presented in note 9 “income taxes” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

new accounting standards 

for a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and pending adoption and the affect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations financial position or liquidity see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” under the caption new accounting standards 

forwardlooking statements 

the foregoing discussion and analysis as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i above

financial terminology 

acquisitions 

the sum of net assets assets less liabilities including acquired debt obtained in a business combination net assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of the combination and include tangible and intangible items 

capital employed 

the sum of interestbearing debt other noncurrent liabilities and shareholders’ equity average capital employed is a 12month average 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and additions to property plant  equipment including capitalized leases renewals and betterments capital expenditures exclude property plant  equipment obtained by business acquisitions 

we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures thus a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some costsaving andor capacityimprovement aspects likewise a profitadding project is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new locations which occasionally replace facilities at old locations to add product lines to expand the capacity of existing facilities to reduce costs to increase mineral reserves to improve products etc 

capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities that are expensed currently including industrial health programs such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels frequently profitadding and major replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental control purposes 

net sales 

total customer revenues from continuing operations for our products and services excluding thirdparty delivery revenues net of discounts and taxes if any 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the sum of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes minority interest in earnings of a consolidated subsidiary amortization of capitalized interest and fixed charges net of interest capitalization credits divided by fixed charges fixed charges are the sum of interest expense before capitalization credits amortization of financing costs and onethird of rental expense 

total debt as a percentage of total capital 

the sum of shortterm borrowings current maturities and longterm debt divided by total capital total capital is the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity 

shareholders’ equity 

the sum of common stock less the cost of common stock in treasury capital in excess of par value retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income loss as reported in the balance sheet average shareholders’ equity is a 12month average 

total shareholder return 

average annual rate of return using both stock price appreciation and quarterly dividend reinvestment stock price appreciation is based on a pointtopoint calculation using endofyear data

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

in december 2007 we issued 3250 million of 3year floating variable rate notes that bear interest at 3month libor plus 125 per annum concurrently we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the stated notional amount of 3250 million at december 31 2009 we recognized a liability of 112 million included in other accrued liabilities equal to the fair value of this swap at december 31 2008 we recognized a liability of 162 million equal to the fair value of this swap included in other noncurrent liabilities a decline in interest rates of 075 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately 19 million 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

at december 31 2009 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was 26859 million as compared to a book value of 25015 million the estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on creditadjusted interest rates on us treasury bills notes or bonds as appropriate the fair value estimate is based on information available to management as of the measurement date although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date the effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately 1341 million 

at december 31 2009 we had 1750 million outstanding under our 3year syndicated term loan established in june 2008 these borrowings bear interest at variable rates principally libor plus a spread based on our longterm credit rating an increase in libor or a downgrade in our longterm credit rating would increase our borrowing costs for amounts outstanding under these arrangements 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

report of independent registered public accounting firm — internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the “company” as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 business 

unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires references in this report to “vulcan” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” refer to vulcan materials company and its consolidated subsidiaries in november 2007 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of florida rock industries inc “florida rock” in a series of mergers collectively referred to as the “florida rock merger” unless otherwise noted all information presented in this report regarding vulcan includes the consolidated results of florida rock 

we provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the us economy headquartered in birmingham alabama we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in florida we are a new jersey corporation that was incorporated on february 14 2007 

we have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix and concrete and cement we have combined our asphalt mix and concrete operations into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics product processes types and classes of customer methods of distribution and regulatory environments 

aggregates segment overview 

construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt and recycled concrete aggregates are essential infrastructure materials required by the u s economy and are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphalt mix and readymixed concrete aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast the aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related products and services in eight regional divisions our aggregates segment constituted approximately 65 76 and 76 of our sales dollars before the elimination of intersegment sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 93 of our sales dollars were referable to aggregates or asphalt mix and concrete that included our aggregates 

during 2008 the aggregates segment served markets in 23 states the district of columbia the bahamas canada the cayman islands chile and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 7 additional states with railroad ballast customers are served by truck rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards due to the high weighttovalue ratio of aggregates markets generally are local in nature quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the united states nondomestic net sales were 25295000 in 2008 19981000 in 2007 and 20595000 in 2006 

each type of aggregates is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregates because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no economically viable deposits of aggregates these areas include sections of the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast and south atlantic coast which are served from remote quarries by barge oceangoing vessels or railroad during 2008 we shipped 2043 million tons into 23 states the district of columbia the bahamas canada the cayman islands chile and mexico from 331 aggregates production facilities and sales yards the 10 largest states that we serve measured by aggregates shipments accounted for 82 of total aggregates shipments 

at the end of 2008 we operated 175 crushed stone plants 47 sand and gravel plants and 20 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business for a discussion of our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves as of the end of 2008 see item 2 “properties” below our current estimate of 133 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 50 billion tons since the end of 1998 during that same period we produced approximately 23 billion tons of aggregates we believe that these reserves are sufficient to last on average 517 years at current annual production rates we do not anticipate any material difficulties in the availability of raw materials in the near future 

in addition to our 242 aggregates production facilities at the end of 2008 we operated 89 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select markets for the sale of aggregates additionally at the end of 2008 our aggregates segment included 15 aggregates related operations for equipment service and repair landfill and transportation 

zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict future governmental policies affecting the construction materials industry we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business however future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations 

we strive to maintain a sufficient level of aggregates inventory to meet delivery requirements of our customers we generally provide our customers with 30day payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry 

asphalt mix and concrete segment overview 

the asphalt mix and concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix and readymixed concrete in four regional divisions serving 8 states primarily in our midatlantic florida southwestern and western markets the bahamas and the district of columbia additionally two of the divisions produce and sell other concrete products such as block prestressed and precast beams and resell purchased building materials related to the use of readymixed concrete and concrete block aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 78 of readymixed concrete by weight our asphalt mix and concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates requirements from our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material utilized in the production of asphalt mix and concrete customers for our asphalt mix and concrete segment are generally served locally from our production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles from the producing facility our asphalt mix and concrete segment constituted approximately 32 24 and 24 of our sales dollars before the elimination of intersegment sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the crushed rock sand and gravel used as raw materials by our asphalt mix and concrete segment are almost wholly supplied by our aggregates segment therefore like the aggregates segment the asphalt mix and concrete segment relies upon our reserves of aggregates concrete production also requires cement in the florida market our requirement for cement for concrete production is substantially supplied by our florida rock division in other markets we purchase cement from third party suppliers the asphalt production process also requires liquid asphalt we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

cement segment overview 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement which is sold in both bulk form and bags to the concrete products industry the brooksville florida plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint plastics and joint compound industries the tampa florida facility imports cement and slag where some of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the cement is blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements which are then sold the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form the port manatee florida facility imports clinker that is ground into bulk cement and sold 

the cement segment’s largest customer is our asphalt mix and concrete segment 

we are in the process of expanding our newberry facility to double its production capacity construction began on this project in 2006 and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2009 the newberry cement plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility the limestone reserves at the newberry cement facility total 1947 million tons or 75 years of life at expected production rates based on the increased plant capacity 

the brooksville calcium facility is supplied by high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry the calcium carbonate reserves at this quarry total approximately 69 million tons or 9 years of life at expected production rates and based on a lease termination 

identifiable assets gross profit sales and primary customers by segment 

 

 

 as shown in the table above primary end uses for our products include public construction such as highways bridges airports schools prisons and other public buildings as well as private nonresidential eg manufacturing retail offices industrial and institutional and private residential construction ie singlefamily and multifamily following is a more detailed discussion of the most significant of these end uses 

end markets 

public — this construction end market is generally the most aggregates intensive the primary end uses include transportationrelated infrastructure such as highways bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams and reservoirs public buildings for government and education are also important end markets for consumption of our products construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources in 2008 publicly funded construction accounted for 45 of our total aggregates shipments 

generally public sector construction spending is more stable than in the private end markets in part because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and often is supported by multiyear legislation and programs public construction projects are typically funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal transportation bill is the principal source of federal funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects federal highway spending is primarily determined by a sixyear authorization bill now covering fiscal years 20042009 and annual budget appropriations using funds largely taken from the federal highway trust fund which receives taxes on gasoline and other levies specific highway and bridge projects are typically managed by state transportation departments which obligate their portion of federal revenues and supplement this federal funding with state fuel taxes vehicle registration fees and general fund appropriations states also transfer funds to counties and municipalities to fund local street construction and maintenance the level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies other public infrastructure construction includes airports sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and government buildings construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the act was signed into law on february 17 2009 for the purpose of creating jobs and restoring economic growth through among other things the modernization of america’s infrastructure and the enhancement of its energy resources since the act is expected to generate significant construction spending demand for our products should increase the act allocates 275 billion for highways and bridges also construction activity will increase due to spending allocated to the following areas 11 billion for airports 84 billion for mass transit 80 billion for high speed rail 46 billion for the army corps of engineers 60 billion for water and sewer projects 42 billion for united states department of defense facilities 64 billion to clean nuclear weapon sites 60 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy 20 billion for renewable energy tax incentives 63 billion to states for energy efficiency and clean energy grants 88 billion for the renovation of schools and 66 billion for a first time homebuyer credit of 8000 the effects of the act will not be felt for several months because congress will have to appropriate funds for these programs and each state will have to take appropriate measures to take advantage of such funding we expect that the economic stimulus plan will provide incremental demand for our major product lines starting in the second half of 2009 we cannot predict the full impact of the spending under the act on our business and the extent and timing of the spending is uncertain at this time 

private — this construction end market includes both nonresidential and residential construction in 2008 privatelyfunded construction accounted for 55 of our total aggregates shipments 

private nonresidential construction includes a wide array of project types and generally is more aggregates intensive than residential construction but less aggregates intensive than public construction overall demand in private nonresidential construction is generally driven by job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends strong corporate profits and growth of the private workforce generate demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals churches and entertainment facilities large industrial projects such as a new manufacturing facility can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply its parts and assemblies additionally construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm’s ability to finance and the cost of such financing 

the majority of residential construction activity is for singlefamily houses with the remainder consisting of multifamily construction ie two family houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises a small portion of the housing supply household formation is a primary driver of housing demand along with 

mortgage rates in the last 10 years the number of households in the united states has increased 11 from 1032 million to 1146 million or approximately 15 on average in the markets we serve construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of the foundation driveway or parking lot 

other 

ballast is sold to railroads for construction and maintenance of track riprap and jetty stone are sold for erosion control along waterways stone also can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder also can be sold as agricultural lime 

seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

virtually all our products are produced and consumed outdoors our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can have on the production and sales volumes of our products normally the highest sales and earnings are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter furthermore our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending these cyclical swings are further affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

financial results 

net sales total revenues earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per common share total assets longterm obligations and cash dividends declared per common share for the five years ended december 31 2008 are reported under item 6 “selected financial data” below 

competition and customers 

the products of all of our reporting segments are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance in most of the markets we serve there are a substantial number of competitors 

we are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the united states we estimate that the 10 largest aggregates producers in the nation produce 35 to 40 of all aggregates in the us there are many small independent producers of aggregates resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we may compete with a number of large regional and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is the transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used we focus on serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future due to the high weighttovalue ratio of aggregates markets generally are local in nature they often consist of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only truck delivery accounts for approximately 84 of our total aggregates shipments additionally sales yards and other distribution facilities located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets that do not have locally available sources of aggregates we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” below 

zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict what governmental policies will be adopted in the future that might affect our industry we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business however land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations 

the customers for each of our reporting segments and the methods of distribution to such customers are detailed in the table under item 1 “business” of this report no material part of our business is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business in 2008 our top five customers accounted for 38 of our total revenues excluding internal sales and no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total revenues our products are sold principally to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although historically over 40 of our sales have on average gone into publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding of publicly funded construction can curtail construction spending our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government elections 

research and development costs 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at our facility in birmingham alabama in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products we spent approximately 1546000 in 2008 1617000 in 2007 and 1704000 in 2006 on such activities 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2009 and 2010 will be approximately 10131000 and 17467000 respectively 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party to perform the legally required reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk and including a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” below reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 25 2009 we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments 

other information regarding vulcan 

our principal sources of energy are electricity diesel fuel natural gas and coal we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for our operation of any of our reporting segments

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment 

risks and uncertainties related to the florida rock merger 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the florida rock merger — the florida rock merger involves the integration of two companies that previously had operated independently each with its own business customers employees culture and systems to realize the anticipated benefits from the mergers we must successfully combine the businesses of vulcan and florida rock in a manner that permits among other things earnings growth and cost savings in addition we must achieve these savings without adversely affecting revenues if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

our incurrence of additional debt to finance a portion of the florida rock merger significantly increased our interest expense financial leverage and debt service requirements — we have incurred considerable shortterm and longterm debt to finance the florida rock merger incurrence of this debt significantly increased our leverage and caused a downgrade in our credit rating there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business 

construction both commercial and residential is dependent upon the overall us economy which remains weak and could weaken further — commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles when the economy is strong construction levels rise and when the economy is weak construction levels fall the overall us economy has been hurt by the changes in the financial services sector including failures of several large financial institutions significant merger and acquisition activity within that industry and the resulting lack of credit 

availability the commercial construction market declined in 2008 due mostly to disruptions in credit availability and was felt most significantly starting in september 2008 also continued weakness in the residential construction market negatively affected the commercial construction market the residential construction market further softened in 2008 as a result of the housing market downturn the overall weakness in the economy and the crisis in the credit markets could cause commercial and residential construction to remain at low levels or weaken further 

the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and in turn the housing market could continue to negatively affect demand for our products — in most of our markets particularly florida and california sales volumes have been negatively impacted by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and a significant decline in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until these slowdowns in residential construction improve 

a decline in public sector construction and reductions in governmental funding could adversely affect our operations and results — in 2008 45 of our sales volume of construction aggregates was made to contractors on publicly funded construction if as a result of a loss of funding or a significant reduction in state or federal budgets spending on publicly funded construction were to be reduced significantly our earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 

difficult and volatile conditions in the credit markets could affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows — the current credit environment has negatively affected the us economy and demand for our products commercial and residential construction could continue to decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economic slowdown continues to cause delays or cancellations of capital projects state and federal budget issues may negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending unless the economic stimulus plan provides the requisite funding 

a recessionary economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on our accounts receivable from our customers we have experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during this economic downturn 

the current credit environment has limited our ability to issue commercial paper additional financing or refinancing might not be available and if available may not be at economically favorable terms interest rates on new issuances of longterm public debt in the market have increased reflecting higher credit and risk premiums there is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at economical interest rates which could negatively affect our business 

we may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions if they arise or to refinance our outstanding debt we are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets through the interest payable on our outstanding shortterm debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper to the extent it is available to us while it is the objective of management to maintain our credit ratings at investment grade levels we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels while management believes we will continue to have adequate credit available to meet our needs there can be no assurance of such credit availability 

weather can materially affect our quarterly results — almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand since their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry — the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets however in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies this results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

our longterm success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas — construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop so our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation — in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results — as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill reclamation costs pension and other postretirement benefits environmental compliance claims and litigation including selfinsurance and income taxes although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — we are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency furthermore unfavorable results in one or more of these actions could result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current legal proceedings see note 12 “other commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” below 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings — the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume — due to the high levels of fixed capital required for the extraction and production of construction aggregates profitability as measured in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales “margins” can be greatly impacted due to changes in volume 

our products generally must be transported by truck rail barge or ship usually by third party providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations — a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the law impact our business — our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts there is the inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business especially from an environmental standpoint these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with zoning and environmental laws and regulations stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us reduce operating hours require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our future growth is dependent in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations — the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own aggregates reserves our constrained credit and financing opportunities make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions additionally with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations

 item 2 properties 

we have 222 sites at which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel of these 219 are located in the united states one in mexico one in the bahamas and one in canada we also have 89 sales yards used for the distribution of stone sand and gravel not located at the extraction facilities the following map shows the locations of our stone and sand and gravel production facilities and our aggregates distribution yards as of december 31 2008 

our current estimate of 133 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 06 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2007 we believe that the quantities of proven and probable reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 517 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 517 years we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 257 million tons see footnote 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type 

 

 

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation subject to permit restrictions 

of the 222 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 86 representing 49 of total reserves are located on owned land 45 representing 21 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 91 representing 30 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2009 to 2159 most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion 

the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of our aggregates facilities contributes more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 

 our cement segment operates two quarries for its raw materials the newberry florida quarry which has limestone reserves of 1947 million tons or 75 years of life at expected future production rates and the brooksville florida quarry which has calcium carbonate reserves of 69 million tons or 9 years of life based on expected production rates and a lease termination 

other properties 

we also operate 124 concrete plants 41 asphalt mix plants 4 cement facilities and 1 calcium plant as noted in the following map 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2013 with two fiveyear renewal periods and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental cost for the current term of the lease is 34 million 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels 

see note 12 “other commitments and contingencies” in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” below for a discussion of our material legal proceedings 

in addition to our legal proceedings listed in note 12 we have one environmental penalty in excess of 100000 during november 2008 we received an administrative civil liability complaint from the california bay area regional water quality control board related to a discharge of water and sediment that occurred at our pleasanton california aggregates facility in april 2007 the complaint alleged that the discharge violated provisions of the california water code and the facility’s national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit we paid a civil penalty of 190000 on february 5 2009 in full settlement of this matter

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the us economy we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates — primarily crushed stone sand and gravel — a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in florida 

segments 

our four operating segments are organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix concrete and cement for reporting purposes we have combined our asphalt mix and concrete segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics product processes types and classes of customer methods of distribution and regulatory environments management reviews earnings for the product line reporting units principally at the gross profit level 

our aggregates segment mines processes distributes and sells crushed stone sand and gravel our asphalt mix and concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix readymixed concrete concrete block prestressed concrete beams 

and precast concrete and sells other building materials our cement segment mines limestone feedstock and produces and sells portland cement and masonry cement it also imports grinds blends and sells cement and slag and produces and sells calcium products 

products 

we operate primarily in the united states and our principal product — aggregates — is consumed in virtually all types of publicly and privately funded construction during 2008 we shipped 2043 million tons into 23 states the district of columbia the bahamas canada the cayman islands chile and mexico from 331 aggregates production facilities and sales yards our ten largest states measured by our aggregates shipments accounted for 82 of our total aggregates shipments reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business our current estimate of 133 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 50 billion tons since the end of 1998 we believe that these reserves are sufficient to last on average 517 years at current annual production rates while aggregates are our primary business we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products such as asphalt mix and concrete can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns as such we evaluate the structural characteristics of individual markets to determine the appropriateness of an aggregatesonly or vertical integration strategy 

for a discussion of end markets competition and customers and seasonality and cyclical nature of our business see item 1 business above 

other 

on november 16 2007 we acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of florida rock industries inc florida rock a leading producer of construction aggregates cement concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and midatlantic states in exchange for cash and stock of approximately 42 billion based on the closing price of vulcan common stock on november 15 2007 the acquisition further diversified the geographic scope of vulcan’s operations expanding our presence in attractive florida markets and in other highgrowth southeastern and midatlantic states and adding approximately 16 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves and 01 billion tons of proven and probable cement and calcium carbonate reserves in many markets where reserves are increasingly scarce 

in june 2005 we sold our chemicals business as presented in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and accordingly its results are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 

in the discussion that follows continuing operations consist of our construction materials business which is organized into three reportable segments aggregates asphalt mix and concrete and cement the results of operations discussed below include florida rock for the periods from november 16 2007 through december 31 2007 and january 1 2008 through december 31 2008 discontinued operations which consist of our former chemicals business are discussed separately in the comparative analysis segment revenue at the product line level includes intersegment sales net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost this presentation is consistent with the basis on which management reviews results of operations 

results of operations 

2008 versus 2007 

the financial and economic turmoil in the us is unprecedented and the external factors affecting the construction industry continue to present unique challenges for our business aggregates demand and our shipments have declined for three consecutive years our legacy aggregates shipments in 2008 were down 30 from the peak level achieved in 2005 throughout 2008 we focused aggressively on controlling costs while realizing higher pricing for our products reflecting their value in the attractive markets we serve we reduced our operating costs by limiting operating hours streamlining our work force and focusing on production efficiencies in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products as a result of these actions the cash earnings per ton of aggregates in our legacy operations increased over 50 from the 2005 level which was a year of peak demand for aggregates the cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in 2008 was higher than in any other period in our history the 

increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover 

net sales for 2008 of 35 billion reflected an increase of 12 from the prior year this increase resulted from the inclusion of the former florida rock operations for the full year volumes were adversely affected by the continuing sharp downturn in construction activity pricing for our products remained strong and helped offset the earnings effects of lower volumes higher energyrelated costs increased interest expense as well as higher noncash charges for depreciation depletion and amortization the unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased 36 and 69 respectively from 2007 in our legacy operations net loss per diluted share was 004 in 2008 compared with net earnings of 454 per diluted share in 2007 the 2008 results include an estimated 2276 million or 207 per diluted share after tax goodwill impairment charge referable to our cement segment in florida the 2008 results also include net earnings per diluted share of 034 referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition results in 2007 include net earnings per diluted share of 024 referable to the sale of real estate in california net of the related incentives additionally the higher energyrelated costs lowered earnings per diluted share 086 compared with 2007 

aggregates segment revenues decreased 414 million to 24068 million compared with 2007 as the effect of lower volumes from legacy operations more than offset the effect of improved pricing and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the former florida rock aggregates operations compared with 2007 total aggregates shipments declined 12 while the average selling price increased 7 most of our geographic markets reported doubledigit percentage declines in aggregates volumes except for markets in texas and along the central gulf coast gross profit for the aggregates segment of 6576 million declined 21 from 2007 as the earnings effects from the decline in legacy vulcan shipments and sharply higher unit cost for diesel fuel more than offset the improvement in aggregates pricing and the inclusion of earnings from the former florida rock operations 

asphalt mix and concrete segment revenues increased 4353 million to 12012 million compared with 2007 shipments of asphalt mix declined 9 in 2008 while concrete shipments increased significantly due to inclusion of a full year of sales from the former florida rock concrete operations asphalt mix prices increased 15 from 2007 while the unit cost of liquid asphalt rose 69 asphalt mix earnings decreased due principally to higher costs for liquid asphalt compared with 2007 gross profit for the asphalt mix and concrete segment decreased 39 to 744 million in 2008 

revenues and gross profit for the cement segment were 1065 million and 177 million respectively the cement segment was acquired in november 2007 as part of the florida rock acquisition and therefore no comparable revenues or earnings were reported for the first 10 months of 2007 

selling administrative and general expenses increased 530 million from 2007 this increase was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses related to the former florida rock businesses 105 million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property and 67 million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions 

during 2008 we recorded an estimated 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement operations in florida representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit there were no comparable charges in 2007 

during 2008 we recorded a 738 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition during 2007 we recorded a 438 million pretax gain net of transaction costs on the sale of real estate in california 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were 751 million a decrease of 5924 million from the prior year in addition to the items noted above higher interest expense contributed to this decrease in earnings interest expense net of interest income increased 1281 million due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of florida rock 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for 2008 versus 2007 are summarized below in millions of dollars 

 

earnings loss from continuing operations decreased to 002 per diluted share in 2008 from 466 per diluted share in 2007 the goodwill impairment charge accounted for 207 per diluted share of the decline 

2007 versus 2006 

consolidated net sales increased 2 from the prior year to a record 31 billion continued strong growth in aggregates pricing during 2007 contributed to an increase in operating earnings yearoveryear despite lower sales volumes across all principal product lines the pricing momentum achieved in 2005 and 2006 continued in 2007 reflecting an environment that recognizes the high cost of replacing aggregates reserves in high growth metropolitan markets 

aggregates segment revenues were 24482 million in 2007 an increase of 2 from 24055 in the prior year excluding the effects of the florida rock acquisition revenues for vulcan’s legacy aggregates segment declined slightly as lower shipments were substantially offset by a 13 increase in average selling prices aggregates shipments during 2007 decreased approximately 9 from 2006 levels primarily as a result of lower demand in the residential construction market the impact of residential construction activity on shipments was partially offset by increased levels of highway construction and nonresidential building construction gross profit for the aggregates segment increased 97 million or 1 over 2006 unit costs for aggregates produced at legacy vulcan operations increased in 2007 due principally to the effects of higher depreciation expense referable to recently completed capital projects coupled with a 10 reduction in production volumes additionally unit costs for energy such as diesel fuel and electric power increased by approximately 7 higher costs for diesel fuel lowered gross profit from legacy vulcan aggregates operations approximately 12 million 

revenues for the asphalt mix and concrete segment increased slightly to 7659 million in 2007 as compared to 7609 million in 2006 excluding the effects of the florida rock acquisition revenues for vulcan’s legacy asphalt mix and concrete segment decreased by 605 million or 8 revenues for asphalt mix improved due to higher pricing which more than offset a 9 decline in volumes concrete pricing improved 7 but was more than offset by a 30 decline in volumes gross profit for the asphalt mix and concrete segment was mixed with asphalt mix improving and concrete declining higher pricing for asphalt mix more than offset the lower volumes and higher prices for aggregates supplied internally unit costs for liquid asphalt remained at high levels in 2007 with little change when compared with the prior year higher pricing for concrete was more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs including aggregates supplied internally 

revenues and gross profit for the cement segment all of which was acquired in the florida rock transaction were immaterial to 2007 results of operations 

operating earnings improved to 7144 million a 28 increase over 2006 the increase in operating earnings was due to the aforementioned higher pricing for each of our principal products and a 438 million gain on sale of real estate in california during the first quarter of 2007 prior year results include a 248 million gain referable to the 

sale of contractual rights to mine a quarry in atlanta georgia these favorable contributions to operating earnings more than offset the effects of lower production levels an increase in energy costs and florida rock transaction and integration related costs 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were 6675 million a decrease of 360 million from the prior year the 2006 earnings include a pretax gain of 287 million related to the increase in the carrying value of the contingent ecu electrochemical unit earnout received in connection with the sale of our chemicals business the 2007 corresponding pretax gain from the ecu earnout was 19 million an increase of 219 million in interest expense also contributed to the decline in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for 2007 versus 2006 are summarized below in millions of dollars 

 

earnings from continuing operations decreased to 466 per diluted share from 481 per diluted share in 2006 earnings per share in 2007 include the effects of the florida rock acquisition including operating results interest expense associated with the financing of the transaction additional shares issued as part of the transaction onetime expenses associated with executing the transaction and integrating the businesses and depreciation associated with the writeup of assets to fair value in accordance with purchase accounting specifically 2007 diluted earnings per share include approximately 013 per share due to onetime transaction related items 012 per share related to higher interest expense attributable to the additional debt incurred to fund the transaction and 007 per share due to the effect of additional shares issued as purchase consideration in the transaction 

selling administrative and general 

selling administrative and general expenses were 3426 million in 2008 as compared with 2896 million in the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to the following including a full year of expenses related to the former florida rock businesses 105 million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property a partially offsetting amount is recorded in gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses net as noted below and 67 million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions excluding the effects of the aforementioned items selling administrative and general expenses decreased approximately 300 million or 11 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of lower performancebased compensation selling administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net sales were 99 in 2008 up from the prior year’s 94 in 2007 selling administrative and general expenses increased 253 million or 96 from the 2006 level this increase was partially attributable to selling administrative and general expenses associated with the newly acquired florida rock operations as well as transaction and integration related costs excluding the effects of florida rock during 2007 selling administrative and general expenses increased approximately 5 over the 2006 level 

goodwill impairment 

during 2008 we recorded an estimated 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement segment in florida representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit these operations were acquired as part of the florida rock transaction in november 2007 there were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2007 and 2006 for additional details regarding this impairment see the goodwill and goodwill impairment critical accounting policy below 

gain on sale of property plant  equipment and businesses net 

during 2008 we recorded gains on the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses of 942 million an increase of 355 million from the prior year included in the 2008 gains was the aforementioned 738 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition also included was 104 million of gain related to the fair market value of donated property during 2007 we recorded gains on the sale of property plant  equipment and businesses of 587 million an increase of 531 million from 2006 included in the 2007 gains was a 438 million pretax gain net of transaction costs on the sale of real estate in california as none of these asset sales met the definition of a “component of an entity” as defined in sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” fas 144 the gains were reported in continuing operations 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income net of other operating expense increased 59 million from the 2007 level to a net income of 04 million in 2008 other operating expense net of other operating income increased 274 million from the 2006 level to a net expense of 55 million in 2007 the variance from 2006 resulted primarily from a 248 million pretax gain in 2006 from the sale of contractual rights to mine the bellwood quarry in atlanta georgia with no similar gain in 2007 

other income expense net 

in 2008 other expense of 44 million declined 09 million from 2007 in 2007 other expense was 53 million compared to other income of 285 million in 2006 gains attributable to increases in the carrying value of the ecu earnout amounted to 19 million during 2007 compared with 287 million in 2006 

interest income 

interest income was 31 million in 2008 compared with 66 million in 2007 this decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances resulting primarily from the financing requirements of the november 2007 florida rock acquisition interest income in 2007 increased 05 million from the 2006 level 

interest expense 

interest expense was 1728 million in 2008 compared with the 2007 amount of 482 million this increase in interest expense was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of florida rock excluding capitalized interest credits gross interest expense for 2008 was 1871 million compared with 533 million in 2007 and 313 million in 2006 interest expense was 482 million in 2007 compared with the 2006 amount of 263 million the 219 million increase was due primarily to approximately 32 billion in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to acquire florida rock 

income taxes 

our 2008 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 1022 up 716 percentage points from 306 in 2007 this increase principally reflected the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge our 2008 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 311 up 05 percentage points from 2007 the 2007 rate for continuing operations was down 11 percentage points from the 2006 rate of 317 this decrease principally reflected a reduction in state income taxes and an increase in the tax benefit from contributions 

discontinued operations 

in 2005 we sold substantially all the assets of our chemicals business known as vulcan chemicals to basic chemicals a subsidiary of occidental chemical corporation the purchaser also assumed certain liabilities related to the chemicals business including the obligation to monitor and remediate all releases of hazardous materials at or from the wichita geismar and port edwards plant facilities the decision to sell the chemicals business was based on our desire to focus our resources on the construction materials business financial results referable to our chemicals business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 

the transaction which was structured as a sale of assets involved initial cash proceeds contingent future proceeds under two earnout provisions and the transfer of certain liabilities at the closing date the fair value of the 

consideration received in connection with the sale of the chemicals business including anticipated cash flows from the two earnout agreements was expected to exceed the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold however pursuant to sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” since the proceeds under the earnout agreements were contingent in nature no gain was recognized on the chemicals sale and the value recorded at the june 7 2005 closing date referable to these two earnouts was limited to 1282 million furthermore under sab topic 5z5 upward adjustments to the fair value of the ecu earnout subsequent to closing which totaled 513 million were recorded in continuing operations and therefore did not contribute to the gain or loss on the sale of the chemicals business ultimately gain or loss on disposal will be recognized to the extent future cash receipts under the 5cp hydrochlorocarbon product hcc240fa earnout related to the remaining performance period from january 1 2009 to december 31 2012 exceed or fall short of its 108 million december 31 2008 carrying amount 

pretax operating results from discontinued operations were a loss of 41 million in 2008 compared with a loss of 193 million in 2007 these operating losses reflect charges related to general and product liability costs including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals businesses for additional information regarding discontinued operations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

accounting changes 

fas 157 — on january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” fas 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no fas 1572 fsp fas 1572 fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the adoption of fas 157 for financial assets and liabilities had no effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows additionally its adoption resulted in no material changes in our valuation methodologies techniques or assumptions for such assets and liabilities see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption fair value measurements for disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of fas 157 

fas 158 — on january 1 2008 we adopted the measurement date provision of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” fas 158 in addition to the recognition provisions which we adopted december 31 2006 fas 158 requires an employer to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its yearend balance sheet this requirement was effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 upon adopting the measurement date provision we remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations as of january 1 2008 pursuant to the transition requirements of fas 158 the transition adjustment resulted in an increase to noncurrent assets of 150 million an increase to noncurrent liabilities of 22 million an increase to deferred tax liabilities of 51 million a decrease to retained earnings of 13 million and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax of 90 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe we have sufficient financial resources including cash provided by operating activities unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets to fund business requirements in the future including debt service obligations cash contractual obligations capital expenditures and dividend payments 

in february 2009 we issued 400 million of longterm debt as noted in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and used the proceeds to reduce shortterm bank borrowings thereby freeing up a like amount of liquidity under our bank lines of credit debt reduction and achieving target debt ratios remain a priority use of cash flows we expect to reduce total debt by 200 million during 2009 excluding any earnings effect from the economic stimulus plan for the full year 2009 we expect capital spending excluding acquisitions to approximate 200 million down sharply from the 3542 million spent in 2008 

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities including discontinued operations decreased 2729 million to 4352 million during 2008 as compared with a total of 7081 million in 2007 net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to goodwill impairment and depreciation depletion accretion and amortization accounted for 848 million of the decrease in addition certain assets were required to be disposed of as a condition to the acquisition of florida rock note 20 to the consolidated financial statements the reclassification of gains resulting from these dispositions and other net gains on sale of property plant  equipment contributed an additional 356 million to the yearoveryear decrease in cash provided by operating activities as the associated cash received is presented as a component of investing activities reductions in trade payables and other accruals accounted for an additional 1026 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities including discontinued operations totaled 7081 million in 2007 an increase of 1288 million or 22 as compared with 2006 net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to depreciation depletion accretion and amortization increased 258 million when compared with the prior year comparative changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities contributed approximately 1290 million to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulting from decreases in accounts receivable and income tax liabilities partially offsetting these favorable changes to operating cash flows was a reclassification to investing activities of 283 million related to net gains on sales of property plant  equipment and contractual rights 

net cash used for investing activities totaled 1890 million in 2008 compared with 36543 million in 2007 the 34653 million decrease was largely attributable to the acquisition of florida rock in 2007 which required cash payments of 32390 million net of cash acquired and including vulcan’s direct transaction costs a reduction in capital spending of 1301 million from the prior year reflects our focus on utilizing cash to reduce debt proceeds from the sale of businesses required to be divested as part of the florida rock acquisition contributed to a 1952 million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses partially offset by a 634 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property plant  equipment additionally 367 million in assets held in money market and other money funds were reclassified from cash equivalents to mediumterm investments during 2008 as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

net cash used for financing activities totaled 2708 million in 2008 as compared with net cash provided by financing activities during 2007 of 29258 million the 31966 million decrease in cash generated from financing activities was due primarily to a 29016 million change in net shortterm borrowing activity an increase in payments of shortterm debt and current maturities of 468 million and a 2710 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt net of discounts and debt issuance costs proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in 2008 of 9491 million were used to pay down shortterm borrowings drawn during 2007 to fund the florida rock acquisition note 6 to the consolidated financial statements partially offsetting these decreases in cash from financing activities were cash proceeds of 551 million from the issuance of common stock as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

our policy is to pay out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating activities as dividends consistent on average with the payout record of past years while maintaining debt ratios within what we believe to be prudent and generally acceptable limits 

working capital 

working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities totaled 7692 million at december 31 2008 an increase of 6018 million from the 13710 million level at december 31 2007 the increase in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease of 10090 million in shortterm borrowings partially offset by an increase in current maturities of 2765 million weakness in demand for our products resulted in a 649 million yearoveryear decrease in net accounts and notes receivable offset by a related decrease in trade payables and accruals of 724 million as of december 31 2008 we have 16725 million in bank lines of credit of which 10825 million was drawn 

working capital totaled 13710 million at december 31 2007 a decrease of 16147 million from the 2437 million level at december 31 2006 the 2007 decrease resulted primarily from the use of cash and shortterm 

borrowings to fund the acquisition of florida rock excluding the effects of the change in shortterm borrowings working capital increased 2780 million primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable offset in part by current trade payables and accrued liabilities acquired in the florida rock transaction 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures which exclude business acquisitions totaled 3542 million in 2008 down 1263 million from the 2007 level of 4805 million during 2008 we completed three major aggregates plant rebuilds and continued the multiyear expansion project at our newberry cement plant as explained in the financial terminology we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project in 2008 profitadding projects accounted for 2301 million or 65 of the 2008 spending 

commitments for capital expenditures were 250 million at december 31 2008 we expect to fund these commitments using available cash internally generated cash flow or additional borrowings 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in 2008 the total purchase price cash and stock consideration paid of acquisitions amounted to 1521 million down significantly from the prior year which included 46784 million related to the florida rock acquisition the largest in our history 

as a result of the 2007 florida rock acquisition we entered into a final judgment with the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj that required us to divest nine florida rock and legacy vulcan sites we completed these divestitures in 2008 resulting in the acquisition of several sites through exchanges with various entities as follows in a transaction with luck stone corporation we acquired two aggregates production facilities in virginia and cash in exchange for two florida rock sites in virginia an aggregates production facility and a distribution yard in a transaction with martin marietta materials inc martin marietta we received cash and acquired an aggregates production facility near sacramento california real property with proven and permitted reserves adjacent to one of our aggregates production facilities in san antonio texas and fee ownership of property at one of our aggregates production facilities in north carolina that we had previously leased from martin marietta in return we divested four aggregates production facilities and a greenfield undeveloped aggregates site located in georgia and an aggregates production facility located in tennessee two of the divested sites included in the transaction with martin marietta were owned by vulcan prior to our acquisition of florida rock accordingly during 2008 we recognized a pretax gain of 738 million on the sale of these assets in a separate transaction we sold our interest in an aggregates production facility in georgia to the concrete company which had been the joint venture partner with florida rock in this operation 

in addition to the 2008 acquisitions obtained in the aforementioned exchanges other acquisitions completed during 2008 included four aggregates production facilities one asphalt mix plant a recycling facility and vacant land located in california an aggregates production facility in illinois and our former joint venture partner’s interest in an aggregates production facility in tennessee these acquisitions cost approximately 1084 million total cash and stock consideration paid including acquisition costs and net of acquired cash 

the 2007 acquisitions included the florida rock acquisition an aggregates production facility in illinois and an aggregates production facility in north carolina in addition to these acquisitions during 2007 we acquired an aggregates production facility in alabama in exchange for two aggregates production facilities in illinois the florida rock acquisition exclusive of divestitures required pursuant to an agreement with the department of justice consisted of 29 aggregates production facilities 15 aggregates sales yards 108 concrete plants 1 cement plant 1 calcium products plant and 3 cement grinding facilities located in the southeastern and midatlantic states proven and probable reserves aggregates calcium products and cement acquired in the florida rock transaction amounted to approximately 17 billion tons 

shortterm borrowings and investments 

net shortterm borrowings and investments at december 31 consisted of the following in thousands of dollars

debt and capital 

the calculations of our total debt as a percentage of total capital and the weightedaverage stated interest rates on our longterm debt as of december 31 are summarized below amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock the percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization total debt as a percentage of total capital as defined in our bank credit facility agreements must be less than 65 in the future our total debt as a percentage of total capital will depend on specific investment and financing decisions as a result of our financing to fund the november 2007 florida rock acquisition our total debt as a percentage of total capital increased for the two subsequent periods above we intend to maintain an investment grade rating and expect our operating cash flows will enable us to reduce our total debt as a percentage of total capital to a target range of 35 to 40 within the next five years in line with our historical capital structure targets we have made acquisitions from time to time and will continue to pursue attractive investment opportunities such acquisitions could be funded by using internally generated cash or issuing debt or equity securities

during 2008 longterm debt increased by 6238 million to 21536 million compared with a net increase of 12078 million in 2007 both the 2008 and 2007 increases relate primarily to debt issuances to fund the november 2007 acquisition of florida rock the issuances noted below effectively replace the shortterm borrowings we incurred to initially fund the cash portion of the acquisition 

in june 2008 we issued 6500 million of longterm notes in two series tranches as follows 2500 million of 5year 630 coupon notes and 4000 million of 10year 700 coupon notes these notes are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 net of discounts from par in the amounts of 05 million and 04 million respectively these discounts are being amortized using the effective interest method over the

new accounting standards 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements as previously noted on january 1 2008 we adopted 

fas 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by fsp fas 1572 

fas 157 applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value accordingly it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances fair value under fas 157 is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability in support of this principle the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data for example a reporting entity’s own data under the standard fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequent basis fsp fas 1572 requires companies to adopt the provisions of fas 157 for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 with early adoption permitted we do not expect the adoption of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities on january 1 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” fas 160 the standard requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests sometimes referred to as minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements noncontrolling interest under fas 160 is defined as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent the standard requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity but separate from the parent’s equity the amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest should be presented separately on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings when a subsidiary is deconsolidated any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be measured at fair value and a gain or loss recognized accordingly fas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we do not expect the adoption of fas 160 on january 1 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” fas 161 the enhanced disclosure requirements of fas 161 are intended to help investors better understand how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fas 133 and how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the enhanced disclosures include for example

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” fas 162 fas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements fas 162 became effective on november 15 2008 

in june 2008 the fasb issued staff position no emerging issues task force eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” fsp eitf 0361 which requires entities to apply the twoclass method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share for participating securities that include awards that accrue cash dividends whether paid or unpaid any time common shareholders receive dividends and those dividends will not be returned to the entity if the employee forfeits the award fsp eitf 0361 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years early adoption was prohibited and retroactive disclosure is required we do not expect the adoption of fsp eitf 0361 on january 1 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

critical accounting policies 

we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements a summary of these policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial 

statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of january 1 for the recent completed fiscal year or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a twostep process the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination as of december 31 2008 goodwill totaled 30830 million as compared with 37891 million at december 31 2007 total goodwill represented 35 of total assets at december 31 2008 compared with 42 and 18 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in 2008 resulted from a 5962 million reduction in the florida rock acquisition goodwill as a result of the final purchase price allocation for more details see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements as well as a goodwill impairment charge of 2527 million as noted below the increase in 2007 resulted primarily from the preliminary purchase price allocation for the november 2007 florida rock acquisition 

the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value including assigned goodwill we have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix concrete and cement within these four operating segments we have identified 13 reporting units based primarily on geographical location the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities including goodwill to those reporting units as of the january 1 measurement date we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach which involves discounting estimated future cash flows and a market approach which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations we reconcile the implied fair values to market capitalization 

the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of january 1 2009 indicated that the carrying value of our cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value based on the preliminary results of the second step of the impairment test we estimated that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit was impaired therefore we recorded a 2527 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december 31 2008 the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of january 1 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore goodwill was not impaired accordingly there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 

determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty actual results may differ materially from those estimates any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects which may result from a decline in our stock price a change in market conditions market trends interest rates or other factors outside of our control or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units which could result in an impairment charge in the future 

for additional information regarding goodwill see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill 

we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances warrant such a review the carrying value of longlived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value in that event a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and longterm assumptions our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends which may be different from actual results we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets 

for additional information regarding longlived assets and intangible assets see notes 4 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements respectively 

reclamation costs 

reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of longlived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets additionally reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease the obligation which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 

in determining the fair value of the obligation we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement once calculated this cost is then discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a creditadjusted riskfree rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 

in estimating the settlement date we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates we use a weightedaverage settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 

reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date additionally reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we follow the guidance of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” fas 87 sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” fas 106 and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” fas 158 when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

the provisions of fas 87 and fas 106 provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans fas 158 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements caption 2006 — fas 158 for a detailed description partially supersedes the delayed recognition principles of fas 87 and fas 106 by requiring that differences between actual results and expected or estimated results be recognized in full in other comprehensive income amounts recognized in other comprehensive income pursuant to fas 158 are reclassified to earnings in accordance with the recognition principles of fas 87 and fas 106 

upon our january 1 2008 adoption of the measurement date provisions of fas 158 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements caption 2008 — fas 158 we changed our measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to december 31 previously we had accelerated our measurement date to november 30 

annually we review our assumptions related to the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 

in selecting the discount rate we consider fixedincome security yields specifically highquality bonds at december 31 2008 the discount rate for our plans increased to 660 from 645 at november 30 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under fas 87 pensions and increased to 665 from 610 at november 30 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under fas 106 other postretirement benefits an analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding highquality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and longterm future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2008 the expected return on plan assets remained 825 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2008 the inflation component of the assumed rate of compensation increase remained 225 in addition based on future expectations of merit and productivity increases the weightedaverage component of the salary increase assumption remained 250 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends at december 31 2008 our assumed rate of increase in the per capita 

cost of covered healthcare benefits increased to 90 for 2009 decreasing each year until reaching 50 in 2017 and remaining level thereafter 

changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions in millions of dollars 

 

as of the december 31 2008 measurement date the pension plans’ fair value of assets decreased from 6797 million to 4190 million due primarily to relatively poor market performance for the domestic and international equity classes and a 480 million writedown in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at westridge capital management inc see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements earnings on assets above or below the expected return are reflected in the calculation of pension expense through the calculation of the “marketrelated value” which recognizes changes in fair value averaged on a systematic basis over five years 

as a result of the june 2005 sale of our chemicals business as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements during 2006 we recognized a settlement charge of 08 million representing an acceleration of unrecognized losses due to lumpsum payments to certain retirees from our former chemicals business 

during 2009 we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately 158 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately 132 million compared with 82 million and 123 million respectively in 2008 this increase in pension expense is primarily related to the asset losses during 2008 normal cash payments made for pension benefits in 2009 under the unfunded plans are estimated at 35 million we expect to make approximately 11 million in required contributions to the funded pension plans during 2009 all of which relates to the pension plan assumed in the florida rock acquisition 

the pension protection act of 2006 ppa enacted on august 17 2006 significantly changed the funding requirements after 2007 for singleemployer defined benefit pension plans among other provisions funding requirements under the ppa are largely based on a plan’s funded status with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses this act did not have a material impact on the funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans during 2008 

while negative returns on plan assets in 2008 have diminished our plans’ funded status including the writedown in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at westridge capital management inc see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration

environmental compliance 

we incur environmental compliance costs which include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control facilities the cost of ongoing monitoring programs the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization policy expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues are expensed costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation efforts are accrued when management determines that a liability is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated at the early stages of a remediation effort environmental remediation liabilities are not easily identified due in part to the uncertainties of varying factors the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur 

when a range of probable loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued as of december 31 2008 the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range was 21 million accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers our safety health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates including key assumptions for accruing environmental compliance costs however a number of factors including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 

for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

claims and litigation including selfinsurance 

we are involved with claims and litigation including items covered under our selfinsurance program we are selfinsured for losses related to workers’ compensation up to 20 million per occurrence and automotive and generalproduct liability up to 30 million per occurrence we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels 

under our selfinsurance program we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses including future legal defense costs based on actuarial studies certain claims and litigation costs due to their unique nature are not included in our actuarial studies we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated for matters not included in our actuarial studies legal defense costs are accrued when incurred accrued liabilities under our selfinsurance program were 578 million 625 million and 452 million as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively approximately 190 million of the increase from 2006 to 2007 relates to liabilities acquired in the florida rock acquisition accrued liabilities for selfinsurance reserves as of december 31 2008 were discounted at 196 as of december 31 2008 the undiscounted amount was 612 million as compared with the discounted liability of 578 million expected payments undiscounted for the next five years are projected as follows 2009 — 202 million 2010 — 110 million 2011 — 85 million 2012 — 53 million and 2013 — 39 million 

significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate for interim financial reporting we estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate as the year progresses we refine the estimates of the year’s taxable income as new information becomes available including yeartodate financial results this continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision reflects the expected annual tax rate significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 

in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we take into account such factors as prior earnings history expected future taxable income mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a deferred tax asset to the extent recovery is unlikely a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made conversely if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 

accounting principles board apb opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes special areas” does not require us income taxes to be provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore we periodically evaluate our investment strategies with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and accordingly whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 effective january 1 2007 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with fin 48 we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law developments and new or emerging legislation such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 

a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent however if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position the liability is presented as current 

we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is reflected in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings due to the magnitude of the impact of statutory depletion on our effective tax rate and taxable income a significant portion of the financial reporting risk is related to this estimate 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 created a new deduction for certain domestic production activities as described in section 199 of the internal revenue code generally this deduction subject to certain limitations was set at 3 for 2006 6 in 2007 and will remain at 6 through 2009 and reaches 9 in 2010 and thereafter the 

estimated impact of this deduction on the 2008 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates is presented in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements

forwardlooking statements 

the foregoing discussion and analysis as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i above 

financial terminology 

acquisitions 

the sum of net assets assets less liabilities including acquired debt obtained in a business combination net assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of the combination and include tangible and intangible items 

capital employed 

the sum of interestbearing debt other noncurrent liabilities and shareholders’ equity average capital employed is a 12month average 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and additions to property plant  equipment including capitalized leases renewals and betterments capital expenditures exclude the property plant  equipment obtained by business acquisitions 

we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures thus a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some costsaving andor capacityimprovement aspects likewise a profitadding project is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new locations which occasionally replace facilities at old locations to add product lines to expand the capacity of existing facilities to reduce costs to increase mineral reserves to improve products etc 

capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities including industrial health programs that are expensed currently such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels frequently profitadding and major replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental control purposes 

net sales 

total customer revenues from continuing operations for our products and services excluding thirdparty delivery revenues net of discounts and taxes if any 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the sum of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes minority interest in earnings of a consolidated subsidiary amortization of capitalized interest and fixed charges net of interest capitalization credits divided by fixed charges fixed charges are the sum of interest expense before capitalization credits amortization of financing costs and onethird of rental expense 

total debt as a percentage of total capital 

the sum of shortterm borrowings current maturities and longterm debt divided by total capital total capital is the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity 

shareholders’ equity 

the sum of common stock less the cost of common stock in treasury capital in excess of par value retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income loss as reported in the balance sheet average shareholders’ equity is a 12month average 

total shareholder return 

average annual rate of return using both stock price appreciation and quarterly dividend reinvestment stock price appreciation is based on a pointtopoint calculation using endofyear data 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business in order to manage or reduce these market risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments 

we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and longterm debt instruments at times we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 

in december 2007 we issued 325 million of 3year floating variable rate notes that bear interest at 3month libor plus 125 per annum concurrently we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a counterparty in the stated notional amount of 325 million and a contractual term coinciding with the maturity of the 325 million of 3year floating rate notes at december 31 2008 we recognized a liability of 162 million equal to the fair value of this swap included in other noncurrent liabilities and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of 96 million net of tax of 66 million equal to the highly effective portion of this swap at december 31 2007 we recognized a liability of 11 million equal to the fair value of this swap included in other noncurrent liabilities and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of 07 million net of tax of 04 million equal to the highly effective portion of this swap we are exposed to market risk for changes in libor as a result of this interest rate swap agreement a decline in interest rates of 075 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately 44 million 

at december 31 2008 the estimated fair market value of our longterm debt instruments including current maturities was 21552 million as compared with a book value of 24653 million the effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately 745 million 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for highquality bonds the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report

 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities and exchange act of 1934 rules 13a — 15e or 15d 15e include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the participation of other management officials evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2008 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f a control system can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 

under management’s supervision an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as auditors of our consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 deloitte  touche llp’s report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting follows this report 

report of independent registered public accounting firm — internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and shareholders of vulcan materials company 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of vulcan materials company and its subsidiary companies the “company” as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 and our report dated march 2 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires references in this report to “vulcan” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” refer to vulcan materials company and its consolidated subsidiaries we entered into an agreement and plan of merger or the “merger agreement” dated as of february 19 2007 as amended on april 9 2007 with legacy vulcan corp a new jersey corporation formerly named vulcan materials company “legacy vulcan” florida rock industries inc a florida corporation “florida rock” virginia merger sub inc and fresno merger sub inc pursuant to the merger agreement on november 16 2007 our newly created wholly owned subsidiary virginia merger sub inc merged with and 

  

into legacy vulcan the “vulcan merger” and our newly created wholly owned subsidiary fresno merger sub inc merged with and into florida rock the “florida rock merger” each of legacy vulcan and florida rock became our wholly owned subsidiaries we refer to these mergers in this report as the “mergers” pursuant to the mergers the existing shareholders of legacy vulcan and florida rock became our shareholders as a result of the mergers each legacy vulcan shareholder received one share of our common stock for each share of outstanding common stock of legacy vulcan held and 30 of the outstanding shares of florida rock common stock were each converted into the right to receive 063 shares of our common stock in addition after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement our name was changed from virginia holdco inc to vulcan materials company and legacy vulcan’s name was changed from vulcan materials company to legacy vulcan corp references in this report to “legacy vulcan” are to legacy vulcan corp and its consolidated subsidiaries references to “florida rock” are to florida rock industries inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we provide infrastructure materials that are required by the american economy headquartered in birmingham alabama we are the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone sand and gravel a major producer of asphalt and concrete and a leading producer of cement in florida we are a new jersey corporation that was incorporated on february 14 2007 and has held legacy vulcan formerly named vulcan materials company and florida rock as direct wholly owned subsidiaries since the completion of the mergers described above florida rock was a leading producer of construction aggregates cement concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and midatlantic states the mergers further diversify the geographic scope of our operations expanding our presence in attractive florida markets and in other highgrowth southeastern and midatlantic states and adding approximately 17 billion tons of proven and probable minerals reserves in markets where reserves are increasingly scarce unless otherwise indicated all information included in this report includes vulcan and florida rock on a consolidated basis 

prior to the november 2007 acquisition of florida rock our construction materials business was organized in seven regional divisions that produced and sold aggregates and related products and services all these divisions exhibited similar economic characteristics production processes products and services types and classes of customers methods of distribution and regulatory environments accordingly they were aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes 

subsequent to our acquisition of florida rock we redefined our operating segments as a result we now have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates asphalt mix and concrete and cement we have combined our asphalt mix and concrete operations into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics product processes types and classes of customer methods of distribution and regulatory environments we have recast our 2006 and 2005 data to conform to the current year’s segment presentation 

aggregates segment overview 

construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt and recycled concrete aggregates are essential infrastructure materials required by the u s economy and are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphalt mix and portland cement concrete aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast the aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates and related products and services in eight regional divisions our aggregates segment constituted approximately 75 75 and 76 of our net dollar sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively less than 1 of our aggregates segment net sales in 2007 was attributable to florida rock since only florida rock results after november 16 2007 were included 

during 2007 the aggregates segment served markets in 22 states the district of columbia the bahamas and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 8 additional states with railroad ballast customers are served by truck rail and water distribution networks from our production facilities and sales yards due to the high weighttovalue ratio of aggregates markets generally are local in nature quarries located on waterways and rail lines allow us to serve remote markets where local aggregates reserves may not be available we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the united states nondomestic net sales were 19981000 in 2007 20595000 in 2006 and 13490000 in 2005 

each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregate because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to 

areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no economically viable deposits of aggregates these areas include sections of the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast and south atlantic coast which are served from remote quarries by barge oceangoing vessels or railroad we shipped 2310 million tons in 22 states the district of columbia mexico and the bahamas from 334 aggregates production facilities and sales yards the 10 largest states that we serve measured by aggregates shipments accounted for 85 of total aggregates shipments 

at the end of 2007 we operated 183 crushed stone plants 51 sand and gravel plants and 16 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business for a discussion of our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves as of the end of 2007 see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 12 below our current estimate of 127 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 45 billion tons since the end of 1997 during that same period 19982007 we produced approximately 23 billion tons of aggregates we believe that these reserves are sufficient to last on average 43 years at current annual production rates we do not anticipate any material difficulties in the availability of raw materials in the near future 

in addition to our 250 aggregates production facilities at the end of 2007 we operated 84 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select markets for the sale of aggregates additionally at the end of 2007 our aggregates segment included 15 aggregates related operations for equipment service and repair landfill and transportation 

zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict future governmental policies affecting the construction materials industry we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business however future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations 

we strive to maintain a sufficient level of aggregates inventory to meet delivery requirements of our customers we generally provide our customers with 30day payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry 

asphalt mix and concrete segment overview 

the asphalt mix and concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix and readymixed concrete in four regional divisions serving 10 states primarily in our midatlantic florida southwestern and western markets the bahamas and the district of columbia additionally two of the divisions produce and sell other concrete products such as block prestressed and precast and resell purchased building materials related to the use of readymixed concrete and concrete block aggregates comprise approximately 95 of asphalt mix by weight and 78 of readymixed concrete by weight our asphalt mix and concrete segment is almost wholly supplied with its aggregates requirements from our aggregates segment these product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material utilized in the production of asphalt mix and concrete customers for our asphalt mix and concrete segment are generally served locally from our production facilities or by truck because readymixed concrete and asphalt mix harden rapidly delivery is time constrained and generally confined to a radius of approximately 20 to 25 miles from the producing facility our asphalt mix and concrete segment constituted approximately 25 25 and 24 of our net dollar sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the crushed rock sand and gravel used as raw materials by our asphalt mix and concrete segment are almost wholly supplied by our aggregates segment therefore like the aggregates segment the asphalt mix and concrete segment relies upon our reserves of aggregates concrete production also requires cement which is supplied substantially internally by our florida rock division in the florida market the asphalt production process also requires liquid asphalt we do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate 

cement segment overview 

our newberry florida cement plant produces portland and masonry cement which is sold in both bulk form and bags to the concrete products industry the brooksville florida plant produces calcium products for the animal feed paint 

plastics and joint compound industries the tampa facility imports cement and slag where some of the imported cement is resold and the balance of the cement is blended bagged or reprocessed into specialty cements which are then sold the slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form the port manatee florida plant imports clinker that is ground into bulk cement and sold 

the cement segment’s largest customer is our asphalt mix and concrete segment 

the production capacity at the newberry facility is being doubled construction began on this project in fiscal 2006 and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2009 the newberry cement plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility the cement plant limestone reserves at the newberry facility total 130174000 tons or 50 years of life at expected production rates based on the increased plant capacity

as shown in the table above primary end uses for our products include public construction such as highways bridges airports schools and prisons as well as private nonresidential eg manufacturing retail offices industrial and institutional and private residential construction ie singlefamily and multifamily following is a more detailed discussion of the most significant of these end uses 

  public — this construction end use market is generally the most aggregates intensive historically public sector construction spending has been more stable than in the private end use markets in part because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates in 2007 publicly funded construction accounted for 47 of our total aggregates shipments public construction projects are typically funded through a combination of federal state and local sources the federal highway bill is the principal source of federal funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects federal highway spending is determined by a sixyear authorization bill now covering fiscal years 20042009 and annual budget appropriations using funds largely taken from the federal highway trust fund which receives taxes on gasoline and other levies specific highway and bridge projects are typically managed by state transportation departments which obligate their portion of federal revenues and supplement this federal funding with state fuel taxes vehicle registration fees and general fund appropriations states also transfer funds to counties and municipalities to fund local street construction and maintenance the level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies other public infrastructure construction includes airports sewer and waste disposal systems water supply systems dams reservoirs and government buildings construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources 

  private nonresidential — this construction end use market includes a wide array of project types and generally is more aggregates intensive than residential construction economic factors such as job growth vacancy rates private infrastructure needs and demographic trends help drive overall demand for private nonresidential construction in 2007 private nonresidential construction accounted for 31 of our total aggregates shipments strong corporate profits and growth of the private workforce generate demand for offices hotels and restaurants likewise population growth generates demand for stores shopping centers warehouses and parking decks as well as schools hospitals churches and entertainment facilities a new manufacturing facility in an area generally generates demand for other manufacturing plants to supply its parts and assemblies additionally construction activity in this end use market is influenced by a firm’s ability to finance and the cost of financing 

  private residential — approximately 8085 of all residential construction activity is for singlefamily houses with the remainder consisting of multifamily ie twofamily houses apartment buildings and condominiums public housing comprises a small portion of the housing supply household formation is a primary driver of housing demand along with mortgage rates in the last 10 years the number of new households has increased 12 from 102 million to 114 million in the u s and 15 on average in the markets we serve construction activity in this end use market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of the foundation driveway or parking lot in 2007 private residential construction accounted for 19 of our total aggregates shipments 

  other end uses — ballast is sold to railroads for construction and maintenance of track riprap and jetty stone are sold for erosion control along waterways stone also can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives fillers and extenders coalburning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions limestone that is crushed to a fine powder also can be sold as agricultural lime in 2007 these other end uses accounted for 3 of our total aggregates shipments

competition and customers 

the products of all of our reporting segments are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance in most of the markets we serve there are a substantial number of competitors 

we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the 10 largest aggregates producers in the nation supply approximately 35 to 40 of the total national market there are many small independent producers of aggregates resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we may compete with a number of large regional and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is the transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used we focus on serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future we have aggregates production facilities located on rail lines and waterways which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of rail and water transportation we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements on page 69 of our 2007 annual report to shareholders and are hereby incorporated by reference 

the customers for each of our reporting segments and the methods of distribution to such customers are detailed in the table on page 4 of this report no material part of our business is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business in 2007 our top five customers accounted for less than 10 of our total sales and no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total sales our products are sold principally to private industry and not directly to governmental entities although historically over 40 of our sales has gone into publicly funded construction such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding of publicly funded construction can curtail construction spending our business is not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government elections 

research and development costs 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at our facility in birmingham alabama in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products we spent approximately 1617000 in 2007 1704000 in 2006 and 1554000 in 2005 on such activities 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2008 and 2009 will be approximately 17397000 and 17221000 respectively 

frequently we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party to perform the legally required reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk and including a reasonable profit margin all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 49 and 70 respectively of the 2007 annual report to shareholders reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been factored in to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

acquisitionsdivestitures 

in 2007 we spent approximately 47373 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included florida rock industries at 42 million total cash and stock consideration paid and smaller bolton acquisitions in north carolina and illinois totaling 589 million in addition to these cash acquisitions during 2007 we acquired an aggregates production facility in alabama in exchange for two aggregates production facilities in illinois we had no material divestitures in 2007 

as a condition to the florida rock merger we were required by the u s department of justice to divest nine sites owned by florida rock and legacy vulcan during the first half of 2008 we expect to complete these divestitures in a series of transactions we currently expect these divestitures to be a combination of cash sales and asset swaps 

seasonality of our business 

virtually all our products are produced and consumed outdoors our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can have on the production and sales volume of our products normally the highest sales and earnings are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending these cyclical swings are further affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves risks you should carefully consider the following risks together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you if any of these risks actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment 

risks and uncertainties related to the mergers 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers 

the mergers involve the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently each with its own business customers employees culture and systems to realize the anticipated benefits from the mergers we must successfully combine the businesses of legacy vulcan and florida rock in a manner that permits among other things earnings growth and cost savings in addition we must achieve these savings without adversely affecting revenues if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the failure to integrate successfully legacy vulcan’s and florida rock’s businesses and operations in the expected time frame may adversely affect vulcan’s future results 

until the completion of the mergers legacy vulcan and florida rock operated independently we face significant challenges in consolidating functions integrating their organizations procedures and operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key legacy vulcan and florida rock personnel the integration of legacy vulcan and florida rock will be costly complex and time consuming 

the integration process and other disruptions from the transaction could be more costly than we expect or result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and others with whom we have business dealings or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers many of these difficulties are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

integrating legacy vulcan and florida rock may divert management’s attention away from our operations 

successful integration of legacy vulcan’s and florida rock’s organizations procedures and operations may place a significant burden on our management and its internal resources the integration efforts could divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during the integration process 

our incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration significantly increased our interest expense financial leverage and debt service requirements 

we established 40 billion of new credit facilities in connection with the mergers and borrowed 335 billion under such credit facilities in order to i acquire 70 of the outstanding shares of florida rock common stock ii settle for cash the florida rock stock options outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers and iii finance our transaction costs incurrence of this new debt significantly increased our leverage there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this new debt could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

the costs of the mergers could adversely affect our operating results 

in connection with the mergers we incurred certain costs consisting of employee benefit costs investment banking legal and accounting fees and other related charges in addition we will incur certain expenses in connection with the integration of legacy vulcan’s and florida rock’s businesses particularly relating to the management information systems 

risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business 

the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the slow recovery in residential construction could continue to negatively affect our volumes 

in some of our markets particularly florida and california sales volumes have been negatively impacted by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the severe slowdown in residential construction our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until these slowdowns in residential construction improve 

a decline in public sector construction and reductions in governmental funding could adversely affect our operations and results 

in 2007 47 of our sales volume of construction aggregates was made to contractors on publicly funded construction if as a result of a loss of funding or a significant reduction in state or federal budgets spending on publicly funded construction were to be reduced significantly our earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 

weather can materially affect our quarterly results 

almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand since their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets however in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies this results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

our longterm success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas 

construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop so our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance 

therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimally facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation 

in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results 

as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 22 through 38 of our 2007 annual report to shareholders we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill reclamation costs pension and other postretirement benefits environmental compliance claims and litigation including selfinsurance and income taxes although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty 

we are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency furthermore unfavorable results in one or more of these actions could result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” on pages 15 through 16 of this report and note 12 “other commitments and contingencies” on pages 65 through 68 to the consolidated financial statements 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume 

due to the high levels of fixed capital required for the extraction and production of construction aggregates profitability as measured in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales “margins” can be greatly impacted due to changes in volume 

our products generally must be transported by rail truck barge or ship usually by third party providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings 

our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations 

a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 

changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning land use environmental and other areas of the laws impact our business 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations related to zoning land use and environmental matters despite our compliance efforts there is the inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business especially from an environmental standpoint these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance expenditures to comply with zoning and environmental laws and regulations stricter laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impose new liabilities on us require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities 

our future growth is dependent in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operation 

as a result of the limited opportunities to establish greenfield quarry sites expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own aggregate reserves our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our company

 item 2 properties 

we have 231 locations in the united states one in mexico one in the bahamas and one in canada at which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our stone and sand and gravel production facilities as of year end 2007 

vulcan materials company stone and sand and gravel production facilities december 31 2007 

    12 

our current estimate of approximately 127 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 13 billion tons from the estimate at the end of 2006 we believe that the quantities of proven and probable reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 43 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 43 years we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 297 million tons see note 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type 

 

 

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation 

of the 234 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 83 representing 47 of total reserves are located on owned land 52 representing 24 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 99 representing 29 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2008 to 2159 most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion 

due to transportation costs the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contributes more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 

 our cement segment operates two quarries for its raw materials the newberry florida quarry which has limestone reserves of 130174000 tons or 50 years of life at expected future production rates and the brooksville florida quarry which has calcium carbonate reserves of 7 million tons or 10 years of life based on expected production rates and a lease termination 

other properties 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2013 with a fiveyear renewal period and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental costs for the current term and the fiveyear renewal period are 32 million and 34 million respectively 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below although the ultimate outcome is uncertain it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows to a material extent 

on october 12 2007 we reached an agreement with the city of modesto in the case styled city of modesto et al v dow chemical company et al filed in san francisco county superior court california to resolve all claims against vulcan for a sum of 20 million the agreement provides for a release and dismissal or withdrawal without prejudice of all claims against vulcan the agreement also expressly states that the settlement paid by vulcan is for compensatory damages only and not for any punitive damages and that vulcan denies any conduct capable of giving rise to an assignment of punitive damages the settlement has been approved by the san francisco superior court judge presiding over this case and thus is now final while we believe the verdicts rendered and damages awarded during the first phase of the trial are contrary to the evidence presented we settled the city’s claims in order to avoid the costs and uncertainties of protracted litigation the 20 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2007 we believe the settlement damages legal defense costs and other potential claims are covered by insurance policies purchased by vulcan and we are pursuing recovery from these insurers 

although this agreement settles all claims against vulcan by the city of modesto related to this litigation certain potential ancillary claims related to this matter remain unresolved at this time we cannot determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss resulting from any such claims 

in addition on or about september 18 2007 vulcan was served with a thirdparty complaint filed in the us district court for the eastern district of california fresno division the underlying action was brought by the united states of america on behalf of the us environmental protection agency against various individuals associated with a dry cleaning facility in modesto called halford’s seeking “recovery of unreimbursed costs incurred by it for activities undertaken in response to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the modesto groundwater superfund site in modesto stanislaus county california” the complaint also seeks certain civil penalties against the named defendants vulcan was sued by the original defendants as a thirdparty defendant in this action no discovery has been conducted in this matter 

we have also recently been named as a defendant in the matter of garcia v dow chemical company et al filed in modesto stanislaus county california this is a wrongful death action that generally alleges that the water supply and environment in the city of modesto were contaminated with toxic chlorinated solvents by the defendants including vulcan and that ms garcia was “hurt and injured in her health” as a result of exposure to said solvents no discovery has been conducted in this matter 

we produced and marketed industrial sand from 1988 to 1994 since 1993 we have been sued in numerous suits in a number of states by plaintiffs alleging that they contracted silicosis or incurred personal injuries as a result of exposure to or use of industrial sand used for abrasive blasting as of january 17 2008 the number of suits totaled 88 involving an aggregate of 554 plaintiffs there are 51 pending suits with 494 plaintiffs filed in texas those texas cases are in a state multidistrict litigation court and are stayed until discovery issues are resolved the balance of the suits have been brought in california florida and louisiana we are seeking dismissal of all suits on the grounds that plaintiffs were not exposed to our product to date we have been successful in getting dismissals from cases involving approximately 17000 plaintiffs with little or no payments made in settlement 

we have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in 2001 and 2002 in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our former geismar louisiana plant in 2001 a trial for the issues of causation and damages for ten plaintiffs was held in july 2004 five of these plaintiffs were dismissed during the trial a jury awarded the remaining five plaintiffs an aggregate award of 201000 in november 2006 the trial court approved a settlement class with most of the remaining plaintiffs in the matter a courtappointed special master is overseeing the settlement process of the november 2006 approved settlement class a second settlement class was approved by the court in 2007 and a court appointed special master is also overseeing the settlement of this second class vulcan paid its insurance deductible as a part of the settlements in 2006 and our insurers are funding the settlements beyond this deductible 

in september 2001 we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09mile section of joliet road that bisects our mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to “repair restore and maintain” the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to “improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate” vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that will further damage the road the court in this case granted summary judgment in favor of vulcan on certain claims the court also granted the plaintiff’s motion to amend their complaint to add a punitive damages claim although the court made it clear that it was not ruling on the merits of this claim discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been set 

on march 22 2006 the united states district court for the southern district of florida in a case captioned sierra club national resources defense council and national parks conservation association v lt gen carl a stock et al ruled that the mining permit issued for our miami quarry which was acquired in the florida rock transaction in november 2007 as well as several permits issued to competitors in the same region had been improperly issued the court remanded the permitting process to the u s army corps of engineers “corps of engineers” for further review and consideration on july 13 2007 the court ordered us to cease most mining excavation at our miami quarry effective on july 17 2007 pending the issuance by the us army corps of engineers of a supplemental environmental impact statement “seis” the order suspends our ability to excavate a substantial amount of reserves at this site however certain reserve deposits as well as material excavated prior to the order remain accessible for mining and processing the court based its decision to shut down mining activity at the miami quarry and two quarries owned by competitors on concern that levels of benzene had been detected in an area of the biscayne aquifer known as the northwest wellfield which supplies a significant portion of the water supply to the miami area at this time we do not have any information to indicate that the benzene was produced by our mining activities or that the levels of benzene pose a risk to human health the district court decision was appealed to the u s court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and oral arguments were held before a panel in miami on november 28 2007 we are currently awaiting a decision from the court 

florida rock industries inc a subsidiary of vulcan and the members of its board of directors prior to the merger with legacy vulcan were named in a purported shareholder class action complaint filed in florida state court the duval county circuit court on march 6 2007 captioned dillinger v florida rock et al the complaint sought to enjoin the merger between florida rock and vulcan that was consummated on november 16 2007 the complaint alleges among other things that the former florida rock directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to florida rock’s shareholders by selling florida rock to legacy vulcan for an inadequate price 

we believe this lawsuit is without merit but have determined to seek a settlement to avoid the expense risk inconvenience and distraction of continued litigation accordingly the parties have entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the settlement of the lawsuit and have agreed to seek final court approval of the settlement and dismissal of the lawsuit on the terms set forth in the memorandum pursuant to the memorandum florida rock agreed to include additional requested disclosure in its proxy statement for the special meeting of shareholders at which the merger agreement was approved and to pay plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees when this memorandum is approved by the court the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice and all other claims whether legal or equitable which the plaintiffs or any member of the purported class may have in connection with the merger of the proxy statement will be released

 item 1 business 

vulcan materials company a new jersey corporation incorporated in 1956 “the company” “vulcan” “we” or “our” is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates and a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete 

our business consists of the production distribution and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt and recrushed asphalt and concrete aggregates are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 70 of the dollar volume of our 2006 net sales as compared to 72 in 2005 and 73 in 2004 the remaining sales in our business result primarily from other products and services including asphalt mix and related products concrete trucking services and water transportation services 

each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregate because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no economically viable deposits of aggregates these areas include sections of the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast and south atlantic coast which are served from remote quarries by barge oceangoing vessels or railroad during 2006 we served markets in 21 states the district of columbia and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 5 additional states with railroad ballast shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 255 million tons in 2006 

in 2006 we spent approximately 205 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included an aggregates production facility and asphalt mix plant in indiana an aggregates production facility in north carolina and an aggregates production facility in virginia 

at the end of 2006 we operated 221 aggregates production facilities including recrushed asphalt and concrete plants located in 17 states and mexico these aggregates facilities included 166 crushed stone plants 37 sand and gravel plants and 18 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business for a discussion of our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves as of the end of 2006 see item 2 “properties” on page 7 we believe that our reserves of aggregates the key raw material of our business are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future we do not anticipate any material difficulties in the availability of raw materials in the near future 

in addition to our aggregates production facilities we operated 66 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select market areas for the sale of aggregates products our other facilities included 46 asphalt mix plants 22 concrete plants and another 17 operations related to service and repair landfill and transportation operations 

the key enduse customers for our aggregates products include heavy construction and paving contractors commercial building contractors concrete products manufacturers residential building contractors state county and municipal governments railroads and electric utilities we serve our customers by truck rail and water distribution networks 

zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict what governmental policies will be adopted in the future that affect the construction materials industry we believe that future zoning and permitting costs will not have a materially adverse effect on our business however future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations 

  

we strive to maintain a sufficient level of aggregates inventory to meet delivery requirements of our customers we generally provide our customers with 30day payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry 

agreement to acquire florida rock industries inc 

on february 19 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100 of the stock of florida rock industries inc florida rock a leading producer of construction aggregates cement concrete and concrete products in the southeast and midatlantic states in exchange for cash and stock valued at approximately 46 billion based on the february 16 2007 closing price of vulcan common stock under the terms of the agreement vulcan shareholders will receive one share of common stock in a new holding company whose subsidiaries will be vulcan and florida rock for each vulcan share florida rock shareholders can elect to receive either 063 shares of the new holding company or 6700 in cash for each florida rock share subject to proration to ensure that in the aggregate 70 of florida rock shares will be converted into cash and 30 of florida rock shares will be converted into stock we intend to finance the transaction with approximately 32 billion in debt and approximately 14 billion in stock based on the february 16 2007 closing price of vulcan common stock we have received a firm commitment from goldman sachs  co to provide bridge financing for the transaction the transaction is intended to be nontaxable for vulcan shareholders and nontaxable for florida rock shareholders to the extent they receive stock the acquisition has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each company and is subject to approval by a majority of florida rock shareholders regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions the transaction is expected to close in midyear 2007 

divestiture of chemicals business 

on june 7 2005 we sold our chemicals business known as vulcan chemicals to basic chemicals a subsidiary of occidental chemical corporation the sale of assets included our chloralkali facilities in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin and the facilities of our chloralkali joint venture located in geismar 

financial results 

net sales total revenues earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per common share total assets longterm obligations and cash dividends declared per common share for the five years ended december 31 2006 are reported under item 6 “selected financial data” 

competition and customers 

all of our products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance in most of the markets we serve there are a substantial number of competitors 

we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the 10 largest aggregates producers in the nation supply approximately onethird of the total national market resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we may compete with a number of large regional and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is the transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used we focus on serving metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future we have facilities located on waterways and rail lines which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of rail and water transportation we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales were 20595000 in 2006 13490000 in 2005 and 7580000 in 2004 longlived assets outside the united states are reported in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements on page 68 of our 2006 annual report to shareholders and is hereby incorporated by reference 

no material part of our business is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business in 2006 our top five customers accounted for less than 10 of our total 

sales and no single customer accounted for more than 3 of our total sales our products are sold principally to private industry although historically over 40 of our sales have gone into public works projects such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although reductions in state and federal funding of public works projects can curtail construction spending our business is not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government elections 

research and development costs 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at our facility in birmingham alabama in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products we spent approximately 1704000 in 2006 1554000 in 2005 and 1341000 in 2004 on research and development activities 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2007 and 2008 will be approximately 16559000 and 7949000 respectively 

vulcan is frequently required by state or local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim its former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site the liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party performing the reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 49 and 69 respectively of the 2006 annual report to shareholders reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been factored in to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 26 2007 we do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents that are material to our business 

other information regarding vulcan 

our principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for our operations 

in 2006 we employed an average of 7983 people 

our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions can have on the production and sales volume of our products normally the highest sales and earnings are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending these cyclical swings are further affected by fluctuations in interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations 

we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding our business

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by any forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k or that we make in other filings with the sec under the securities act of 1933 the securities and exchange act of 1934 or in other public statements you should consider the following factors carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k before deciding to purchase sell or hold our securities 

a decline in public sector construction work and reductions in governmental funding could adversely affect our operations and results in 2006 approximately 44 of our sales of construction aggregates were made to contractors on public work projects if as a result of a loss of funding or a significant reduction in state or federal budgets spending on public sector projects were to be reduced significantly our earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 

weather can materially affect our quarterly results almost all of our products are used in the public or private construction industry and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ shortterm demand since their work also can be hampered by weather therefore our results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 

within our local markets we operate in a highly competitive industry the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets however in most markets we also compete against large private and public companies this results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate significant competition could lead to lower prices lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

our longterm success is dependent upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and therefore difficult to transport efficiently because of the nature of the products the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs therefore except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail barge or ship the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites new 

quarry sites often take a number of years to develop so our strategic planning and new site development efforts must stay ahead of actual growth additionally in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance therefore our future success is dependent in part on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth to locate facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 

we use large amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation in our production and distribution processes we consume significant amounts of electricity diesel fuel liquid asphalt and other petroleumbased resources the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 

we use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results as discussed more fully in “critical accounting policies” under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 32 through 36 of our 2006 annual report to shareholders we use significant judgment in accounting for our ecu electrochemical unit earnout impairment of longlived assets excluding goodwill reclamation costs pension and other postretirement benefits environmental compliance claims and litigation including selfinsurance and income taxes although we believe we have sufficient experience and procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty we are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business although we divested our chemicals business in june 2005 we retained certain liabilities related to the business as required by generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency furthermore unfavorable results in one or more of these actions could result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for a description of our current legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” on pages 10 through 11 of this form 10k and note 12 “other commitments and contingencies” on pages 65 through 67 to the consolidated financial statements 

the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase however if these costs continue to rise this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our industry is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed and semifixed costs therefore our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume due to the high levels of fixed capital required for the extraction and production of construction aggregates profitability as measured in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales “margins” can be greatly impacted due to changes in volume 

our products generally must be transported by rail truck barge or ship usually by third party providers significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control including rail service interruptions or rate increases tariffs rising fuel costs and 

capacity constraints additionally inclement weather including hurricanes tornadoes and other weather events can negatively impact our distribution network 

we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire other businesses failure to manage and successfully integrate them could adversely affect our business we continually evaluate opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions we believe that there are risks related to acquiring businesses including overpaying for acquisitions losing key employees of the acquired business unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions diversion of management time and resources increased legal and compliance costs and unanticipated liabilities of an acquired company failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly in sales and operations a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract develop and retain qualified personnel our success in attracting qualified personnel particularly in the areas of sales and operations is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we have 202 locations in the united states and 1 in mexico at which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our aggregates production facilities 

our current estimate of approximately 114 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 371 million tons from the estimate at the end of 2005 we believe that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 44 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 44 years we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 258 million tons see note 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type 

 

 

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation 

of the 203 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 72 representing 46 of total reserves are located on owned land 39 representing 21 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 92 representing 33 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2007 to 2159 most of our leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms by renewals at our discretion 

due to transportation costs the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contributes more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 

 other properties 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2013 with a fiveyear renewal period and consists of approximately 184125 square feet the annual rental costs for the current term and the fiveyear renewal period are 32 million and 34 million respectively 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below although the ultimate outcome is uncertain it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows to a material extent 

in november 1998 we were named one of several defendants in a claim filed by the city of modesto in state court in san francisco california the plaintiff sought to recover costs to investigate and clean up low levels of soil and groundwater contamination in modesto including a small number of municipal water wells from a dry cleaning compound perchloroethylene this product was produced by several manufacturers including our former chemicals business which was sold in june 2005 the defendants included other chemical and equipment manufacturers distributors and dry cleaners the trial of this case began during the first quarter of 2006 on june 9 2006 the jury returned a joint and several verdict against six defendants including vulcan for compensatory damages of 31 million constituting the costs to filter two wells and pay for certain past investigation costs on june 13 2006 the jury returned separate punitive damages awards against three defendants including 100 million against vulcan on august 1 2006 the trial judge entered an order reducing the punitive damage verdict against vulcan to 725 million and upholding the jury’s findings on compensatory damages although the compensatory damages verdict was upheld by the court we believe our share of the compensatory damages after setoffs from other settlements will not be material to our consolidated financial statements accordingly we have not accrued any amounts related to the compensatory damages verdict we believe that the punitive damage verdict is contrary to the evidence presented at trial and we are continuing to review potential legal remedies while it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of this litigation pursuant to sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we have recorded a contingent liability related to the punitive damages claim of 725 million as of december 31 2006 

as part of the first trial the court on february 14 2007 entered a final statement of decision ruling in favor of the city of modesto and against vulcan and other defendants on certain claims not submitted to the jury relating to the california polanco act the judge awarded additional joint and several damages of 438000 against vulcan and the other five defendants in addition the city of modesto will be allowed to seek attorney fees against these six defendants and vulcan could also be required to pay a portion of future remediation costs at one of the four sites at issue in the trial as of december 31 2006 we have recorded a contingent liability related to this ruling in the amount of 100000 representing a best estimate of our potential share of the 438000 awarded at this time we cannot determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate the range of potential attorney fees or future remediation costs that vulcan may have to pay 

in this same lawsuit the plaintiff seeks a second trial for soil and groundwater contamination at other locations in modesto that were not part of the first trial and the timing of the second trial has not been set by the court no municipal water wells are part of the second trial at this time we cannot determine the likelihood or reasonably estimate a range of loss resulting from the remaining phases of the trial 

we have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in 2001 in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our former geismar louisiana plant in 2001 a trial for the issues of causation and damages for ten 

plaintiffs was held in july 2004 five of these plaintiffs were dismissed during the trial a jury awarded the remaining five plaintiffs an aggregate award of 201000 in november 2006 the trial court approved a settlement class with most of the remaining plaintiffs in the matter a courtappointed special master is overseeing the settlement process of the november 2006 approved settlement class a second settlement class was agreed to in principle in january 2007 for those plaintiffs who opted out of the november 2006 approved settlement class the details of the second settlement class are currently in negotiation we anticipate all of these matters being resolved in 2007 we have previously recorded a charge for the selfinsured portion of these losses and vulcan’s insurers are responding to amounts in excess of the selfinsured retention 

in september 2001 we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09mile section of joliet road that bisects our mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to “repair restore and maintain” the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to “improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate” vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that will further damage the road discovery is ongoing 

we produced and marketed industrial sand from 1988 to 1994 since july 1993 we have been sued in numerous suits in a number of states by plaintiffs alleging that they contracted silicosis or incurred personal injuries as a result of exposure to or use of industrial sand used for abrasive blasting as of february 15 2007 the number of suits totaled 101 involving an aggregate of 567 plaintiffs of the pending suits 52 with 495 plaintiffs are filed in texas the balance of the suits have been brought by plaintiffs in state courts in california florida louisiana and mississippi we are seeking dismissal of all suits on the ground that plaintiffs were not exposed to our product to date we have been successful in getting dismissals from cases involving almost 17000 plaintiffs

 item 1 business 

vulcan materials company a new jersey corporation incorporated in 1956 and its subsidiaries “the company” “vulcan” “we” or “our” are principally engaged in the production distribution and sale of construction materials vulcan is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates and a major producer of asphalt and concrete 

divestiture of chemicals business 

on june 7 2005 vulcan completed the sale of its chemicals business known as vulcan chemicals to occidental chemical corporation the sale of assets included vulcan’s chloralkali plants in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin as well as vulcan chemicals’ joint venture located in geismar louisiana 

continuing operations — construction materials 

our business consists of the production distribution and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt and recrushed concrete aggregates are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 72 of the dollar volume of our 2005 net sales as compared to 73 in 2004 and 72 in 2003 the remaining sales in our business result primarily from other products and services including asphalt mix and related products concrete trucking services and water transportation services 

each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregate because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to the areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are areas where there are no economically viable deposits of aggregates these areas include sections of the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast and south atlantic coast which are served from remote quarries by barge oceangoing vessels or railroad we serve markets in 24 states the district of columbia and mexico shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 260 million tons in 2005 

in 2005 we spent approximately 940 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included eleven aggregates operations and five asphalt plants in arizona georgia indiana and tennessee 

at the end of 2005 we operated 224 aggregates production facilities including recrushed concrete plants located in 17 states and mexico these aggregates facilities included 169 crushed stone plants 39 sand and gravel plants and 16 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business for a discussion of our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves as of the end of 2005 see item 2 “properties” below we believe that our reserves of aggregates the key raw material of our business are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future we do not anticipate any material difficulties in the availability of raw materials in the near future 

in addition to our aggregates production facilities we operated 59 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select market areas for the sale of aggregates products our other facilities included 41 asphalt plants 23 concrete plants and another 17 operations related to service and repair landfill and transportation operations 

the key enduse customers for our aggregates products include heavy construction and paving contractors residential and commercial building contractors concrete products manufacturers state county and municipal governments and railroads we serve our customers by truck rail and water distribution networks during 2005 domestic and international operations served markets in 22 states the district of columbia and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 2 additional states with railroad ballast only 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict what governmental policies will be adopted in the future regarding environmental controls which affect the construction materials industry we believe that future environmental control costs will not have a materially adverse effect upon our business furthermore any future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations 

we strive to maintain a sufficient level of inventory of aggregates to meet delivery requirements of our customers we generally provide our customers with 30day payments terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry 

financial results 

net sales total revenues earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per common share total assets longterm obligations and cash dividends declared per common share for the five years ended december 31 2005 are reported under item 6 “selected financial data” 

competition and customers 

all of our products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance in most of the markets we serve there are a substantial number of competitors 

we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the top ten producers in the nation represent approximately onethird of the total national production of aggregates resulting in highly fragmented markets in many areas therefore depending on the market we compete with a number of large national and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value an important competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is the transportation cost necessary to deliver product to the location where it is used our goal is to gain a significant market presence in the metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future we have facilities located on waterways and rail lines which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of rail and water transportation we sell a small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales were 13490000 in 2005 7580000 in 2004 and 6884000 in 2003 

no material part of our business is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business in 2005 our top five customers accounted for less than 10 of our total sales and no single customer accounted for more than 3 of our total sales our products are sold principally to private industry although historically over 40 of our sales have gone into public works projects such as highways airports and government buildings relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore although cuts in state and federal funding of public works projects can curtail construction spending our business is not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government elections 

research and development costs 

we conduct research and development and technical service activities at a facility located in birmingham alabama in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products we spent approximately 1554000 in 2005 1341000 in 2004 and 1440000 in 2003 on research and development activities 

environmental costs and governmental regulation 

we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2006 and 2007 will be approximately 14204000 and 7484000 respectively 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting our operations are also subject to applicable state and federal mining regulations in 1997 the environmental protection agency “epa” promulgated changes to the national ambient air quality standards these changes included modifying the existing pm10 standards and introduced a new fine particulate pm25 standard particles smaller than 25 microns in diameter these revised standards will eventually affect many areas of the country by requiring a reevaluation of whether the areas are in “attainment” with the new standards however testing jointly conducted by our leading industry trade association the national stone sand and gravel association and epa has indicated that crushed stone sand and gravel operations are not major sources of fine particulate pm25 emissions as such we do not currently believe that the costs associated with compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

vulcan is frequently required by state or local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim its former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the owned or leased mining site to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party performing the reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 29 and 58 respectively of the 2005 annual report to shareholders reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills however no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been factored in to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability 

patents and trademarks 

as of february 28 2006 we do not own have license or other rights under or against any patents which are material to our business 

other information regarding vulcan 

our principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the required sources of energy for our operations 

in 2005 we employed an average of 8051 people this number includes an average of 415 of our former chemicals employees 

our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that weather can have on sales and production volumes normally the highest sales and earnings of our business are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter cyclical swings in the construction industry brought on by the level of interest rates and by public spending on infrastructure can impact our earnings 

we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding our business

 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we have 207 locations in the united states and 1 in mexico at which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our aggregates production facilities 

our current estimate of approximately 111 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 193 million tons from the estimate at the end of 2004 we believe that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 45 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 45 years we assumed an annual aggregates production rate of 246 million tons see note 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type 

 

 

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation 

of the 208 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 75 representing 45 of total reserves are located on owned land 35 representing 21 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 98 representing 34 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2006 to 2104 most of our leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms by renewals at our discretion 

due to transportation costs the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contributes more than 5 to our net sales 

 

 

 other properties 

our headquarters are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2013 and consists of approximately 189000 square feet the annual rental costs for the current term and the fiveyear renewal period are 32 million and 34 million respectively 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the course of our construction materials and former chemicals operations we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges 

as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business 

we are also a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operation and cash flows to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operation or cash flows to a material extent 

we are involved in an action filed in november 1998 by the city of modesto in state court in california this claim arose from allegations of perchloroethylene contamination of municipal water wells in the city of modesto and alleges certain claims against us and other chemical and equipment manufacturers distributors and dry cleaners the trial of this case began during the first quarter of 2006 and is expected to take several months

in november 2002 we received two directives and notices to insurers nos 20029 and 200210 collectively the “directives” from the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” the njdep asserts in its directives that the respondents named therein including us are strictly and jointly and severally liable under state law specifically the new jersey spill compensation and control act njsa 58102311 with respect to certain environmental conditions that allegedly affect two former asphalt plant sites these two sites are referred to in the directives as the roseland site located in essex county new jersey and the rockaway site located in morris county new jersey collectively the “sites” on november 4 2003 we executed njdep administrative consent orders “acos” concerning the two sites we agreed under these acos to complete the investigation and remediation of each of the sites and thereby resolve our liabilities if any in regard to the claims asserted by the njdep in its directives furthermore we intend to seek contribution from the former owners and operators of the sites for all costs we have incurred or will incur under the acos we never operated either of the sites prior to the sale to the current owner during the mid1990s the sites were owned and operated by tarmac minerals inc we acquired the stock of tarmac minerals inc in october 2000 as part of the tarmac acquisition 

in october 1996 we commenced construction of a lime kiln at our manteno illinois site in january 1998 the manteno plant operations began in may 2003 we suspended operation of the kiln the state of illinois and the illinois environmental protection agency have alleged violations of the illinois environmental protection act and the illinois attorney general’s office has become involved in the matter although no enforcement proceeding has been instituted the attorney general’s office has recently demanded fines in excess of 1 million

although the ultimate outcome of this litigation is uncertain it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

accounted for as a derivative instrument future estimates of this derivatives fair value could vary materially from period to period proceeds under the second earnout will be determined based primarily on the performance of the hydrochlorocarbon product hcc240fa commonly referred to as 5cp from the closing of the transaction through 2012 under this earnout provision cash plant margin for 5cp in excess of an agreedupon threshold and after certain capital expenditures will be shared equally with the purchaser closing of the transaction which is currently anticipated to occur during the first half of 2005 is subject to customary regulatory and other closing conditions the total cash costs to be incurred in connection with the transaction are estimated to be approximately 002 per diluted share and consist primarily of transaction fees we performed an impairment test of the related longlived assets as of december 31 2004 as of the december 31 2004 measurement date the test indicated no impairment of the chemicals business assets we will continue to assess the chemicals business assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or as significant new information becomes available these future assessments will compare the anticipated initial proceeds from the sale of the net assets and our estimate of the probable receipts from the earnout provisions to the carrying value of the assets which could change materially in the near future there can be no assurance as to the future amount received from page 2 the earnouts if any for further information regarding this transaction and its accounting treatment see note 2 discontinued operations assets held for sale and liabilities of assets held for sale to the financial statements which is incorporated hereby by reference continuing operations  construction materials our construction materials business consists of the production distribution and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt and recrushed concrete aggregates are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 73 of the dollar volume of construction materials 2004 net sales as compared to 72 in 2003 and 71 in 2002 the remaining sales in the construction materials business result primarily from other products and services including asphalt mix and related products readymixed concrete trucking services and water transportation services each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregate because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to the areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are the areas along the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and along the gulf coast and south atlantic coast which are served from remote quarries by barge or oceangoing vessels and other railserved quarries our construction materials business serves markets in 25 states the district of columbia and mexico shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 2431 million tons in 2004 in 2004 we spent approximately 346 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included three aggregates facilities in tennessee one in south carolina and one in virginia at the end of 2004 we operated 210 aggregates production facilities including recrushed concrete plants located in 17 states and mexico these aggregates facilities included 162 crushed stone plants 29 sand and gravel plants and 19 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business for a discussion of our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves as of the end of 2004 see item 2 properties below we believe that construction materials raw material reserves are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future we do not anticipate any material difficulties in either the number of sources or availability of raw materials in the near future in addition to our aggregates production facilities we operated 67 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select market areas for the sale of aggregates products our other facilities included 39 asphalt plants 23 readymixed concrete plants and another 17 operations related to service and repair and transportation operations the key enduse customers for our aggregates products include heavy construction and paving contractors residential and commercial building contractors concrete products manufacturers state county and municipal governments and railroads we serve our customers by truck rail and water distribution networks during 2004 domestic and international operations served markets in 21 states the district of columbia and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 4 additional states with railroad ballast only environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although we cannot predict what governmental policies will be adopted in the future regarding environmental controls which affect the construction materials industry we believe that future environmental control costs will not have a materially adverse effect upon our business furthermore any future land use restrictions in some markets could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while potentially curtailing expansion or acquisitions in certain areas could also enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations by restraining the entry or continuing operations of competitors in those areas page 3 construction materials strives to maintain a sufficient level of inventory of its aggregates to meet delivery requirements of its customers the construction materials business generally provides for standard payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry of payment within 30 days of being invoiced discontinued operations  chemicals as discussed above we have entered into an agreement to divest our chemicals business see page 2 of this report in 2004 we operated under the vulcan chemicals name and managed our line of chloralkali products and related businesses the chemicals business delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers on occasion when necessary to conform to regional industry practices we have sold product under various payment terms following is a summary of the principal products produced by vulcan chemicals and the industry and uses for which the products are primarily sold 

 the chloralkali business units sales to the chemical processing industry serve companies that produce organic and inorganic chemical intermediates and finished products products sold in this market include hydrochloric acid chlorine caustic soda caustic potash potassium carbonate and various chlorinated page 4 hydrocarbons we also sell chloroform perchloroethylene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons to the fluorocarbons market as feedstocks for manufacturing refrigerants vulcan chemicals includes a joint venture with mitsui  co ltd for the production and distribution of edc chlorine and caustic soda this joint venture is structured to take advantage of our production capabilities and mitsuis access to global edc markets mitsui the worlds leading edc trader purchases all of the edc output of our joint venture facility underground reserves of salt a basic raw material used by vulcan chemicals in the production of chlorine and caustic soda are located near our wichita kansas and geismar louisiana plants we own or lease salt reserves at wichita and geismar as discussed in item 2 below we purchase salt for our port edwards wisconsin plant from several regional supply sources ethylene methanol and vinyl chloride monomer the major raw materials used by vulcan chemicals are purchased from several different suppliers sources of salt ethylene methanol vinyl chloride monomer and various other raw material chemicals are believed to be adequate for our operations and we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining necessary raw materials in the 1990s the production of carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for emissive uses was phased out to a large extent because of the ozonedepleting properties of these chemicals in 2002 we completed construction of a plant at our geismar complex that produces 5cp a feedstock to make new environmentallyfriendly fluorocarbons that will replace ozonedepleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons under a longterm agreement we supply 5cp to honeywell fluorine products group for its plant which is also located in geismar the resulting foamblowing agent offers environmental benefits over ozonedepleting compounds and it exhibits comparable or superior insulation performance financial results net sales total revenues earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per common share total assets longterm obligations and cash dividends declared per common share for the five years ended december 31 2004 are reported under item 6 below competition and customers all of our products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance there are a substantial number of competitors in both the construction materials and chemicals businesses we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the top ten producers in the nation represent approximately a third of the total national market resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we compete with a number of large national and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value a main competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is having a transportation advantage over competitors our strategy is to gain a significant market presence in the metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future we have facilities located on waterways and rail lines which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of lower rail and water transportation cost per unit construction materials sells a small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales by construction materials were 7580000 in 2004 6884000 in 2003 and 4422000 in 2002 vulcan chemicals competes throughout the united states with numerous companies including some of the nations largest chemical companies in the production and sale of our lines of chemicals we compete principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for our products and also competes for sales to customers outside the united states primarily in asia south america and europe vulcan chemicals net sales to foreign customers were 41126000 in 2004 30956000 in 2003 and 27491000 in 2002 page 5 no material part of the construction materials or chemicals business of vulcan is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on vulcan our products are sold principally to private industry although historically over 40 of our construction materials sales have gone into public works projects relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore we do not believe any material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts as a result of state or federal government elections research and development costs we conduct research and development activities for both of our businesses construction materials research and development facility is located in birmingham alabama chemicals research and development laboratory is located in wichita kansas in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our construction materials and chemicals products as well as the production or processing efficiencies for our chemicals products we spent approximately 1341000 in 2004 1440000 in 2003 and 1240000 in 2002 on research and development activities for within construction materials we spent approximately 3774000 in 2004 4636000 in 2003 and 4513000 in 2002 on research and development activities with chemicals environmental costs and governmental regulation we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2005 and 2006 will be approximately 14575000 and 5414000 respectively for construction materials and 6685000 and 2200000 respectively for chemicals if the divestiture of chemicals is not completed in 2005 contrary to our current expectations certain operations of our chemicals business are subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra under the corrective action requirements of rcra the environmental protection agency epa must identify facilities subject to rcras hazardous waste permitting provisions where past practices have caused releases of hazardous waste or constituents thereof the owner of any such facility is then required to conduct a remedial facility investigation rfi defining the nature and extent of any such releases if the results of the rfi determine that constituent concentrations from any such release exceed action levels specified by the epa the facility owner is further required to perform a corrective measures study cms identifying feasible technological alternatives for addressing these releases depending upon the results reported to the epa in the rfi and cms the epa subsequently may require a corrective measures implementation cmi by the facility owner such as implementation of a cleanup plan developed by the epa based on the rfi and cms our port edwards plant has completed its required cleanup and will not incur any rfi and cms costs going forward we expect to incur rfi and cms costs over the next several years at our geismar and wichita chemical manufacturing facilities upon the consummation of the sale of chemicals however liability for these costs will become the responsibility of the purchaser for each of these two facilities the rfi and cms results will determine whether the epa subsequently requires a cmi to address releases at the facility and the scope and cost of any such cmi with respect to those rfi and cms costs that currently can be reasonably estimated we have determined that our accrued reserves are adequate to cover such costs the total costs that we may ultimately incur in connection with discharging our obligations under rcras corrective action requirements have been estimated and accrued based on information currently available to us however there is no assurance that the actual costs when incurred will not exceed our current expectations our construction materials operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety including noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting construction materials operations are also subject to applicable state and federal mining regulations in 1997 the environmental protection agency epa promulgated changes to the national ambient air quality standards these changes included modifying the existing pm10 standards and introduced a new fine particulate pm25 standard particles smaller than 25 microns in diameter these revised standards will eventually affect many areas of the country by requiring a reevaluation of whether the areas are in attainment with the new page 6 standards however testing jointly conducted by our leading industry trade association the national stone sand and gravel association and epa has indicated that crushed stone sand and gravel operations are not major sources of fine particulate pm25 emissions as such we do not currently believe that the costs associated with compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on our operations vulcan is frequently required by state or local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim its former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the owned or leased mining site to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party performing the reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 38 and 5354 respectively of the 2004 annual report to shareholders reclaimed quarries often have a future use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills no potential future cash flows from these anticipated future users have been used to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability patents and trademarks as of march 1 2005 we own have license or other rights under or against or have made applications for approximately 100 patents now issued or pending in the united states and various other countries as well as four trademarks registered or pending registration in the united states and other countries these patents patent applications and trademarks relate to our businesses primarily our chemicals business we believe our patents patent applications and trademarks are valuable both individually and in the aggregate to our operations but no single patent patent application or trademark is material to the conduct of our business as a whole other information regarding vulcan our principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the required sources of energy for our operations in 2004 construction materials employed an average of 7238 people vulcan chemicals employed an average of 952 people our corporate office employed an average of 220 people our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that weather can have on the sales and production volume of the construction materials business normally the highest sales and earnings of the construction materials business are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter cyclical swings in the construction industry brought on by the level of interest rates and by public spending on infrastructure can impact our earnings we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding either of our businesses or our business considered as a whole investor information we make available on our website

 item 2 properties construction materials we have 191 locations in the united states and mexico at which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our stone quarries and sand and gravel facilities page 8 our current estimate of approximately 10862 million tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 295 million tons from the estimate at the end of 2003 we believe that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 48 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 48 years we assumed an annual operating aggregates production rate of 225 million tons see note 1 to the following table for a description of our method employed for estimating the life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage of aggregates reserves by rock type 

 

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation of the 191 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 71 representing 46 of total reserves are located on owned land 34 representing 22 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 86 representing 32 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2005 to 2104 most of our leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms by renewals at our discretion due to transportation costs the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contribute more than 5 to the net sales of our construction materials business page 9 

 

 chemicals vulcan chemicals operates production facilities in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin with a few exceptions the geismar and wichita facilities produce the full line of products manufactured by vulcan chemicals the port edwards plant produces chlorine caustic soda hydrochloric acid caustic potash and potassium carbonate all of the facilities at wichita are located on a 2271acre tract of land that we own we hold mineral rights for salt which is used in production at this facility under two leases that are automatically renewable from yeartoyear unless terminated by us and under several other leases that may be kept in effect so long as production from the underlying properties is continued in addition we own 160 acres of salt reserves and 108 acres of water reserves we maintain an electric power cogeneration facility at the wichita plant site which is capable of generating approximately onethird of the plants electricity and twothirds of the plants process steam requirements we have placed this cogeneration facility in reserve and are purchasing all of our requirements for electric power from a local utility at favorable rates pursuant to a longterm agreement through a separate page 10 agreement with this utility we operate our cogeneration unit upon the request of the utility at various times during the summer peak electricity demand period selling the cogenerated electricity to the utility at profitable rates the facilities at geismar are located on a 2185acre tract of land that we own we hold mineral rights for salt which is used in the production process under a lease which may be extended at our option through january 2037 included in the facilities at the geismar plant are the operations associated with the joint venture with mitsui  co ltd longterm contracts with the regional utility are in place to supply the electrical power requirements of the geismar facility including the joint venture plant the plant facilities at port edwards are located on a 34acre tract of land on which we own the surface rights currently we purchase our salt and electrical power requirements for the port edwards facility from regional supply sources our chemicals production facilities are designed to permit a high degree of flexibility as to raw material feedstocks product mix and product ratios therefore actual plant production capacities vary according to these factors other properties the headquarters for the corporate staff the staffs for construction materials including the southern and gulf coast division and chemicals are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the office space is leased through december 31 2013 and consists of approximately 189000 square feet the annual rental for the current term and the fiveyear renewal period are 32 million and 34 million respectively 


 item 3 legal proceedings in the course of our construction materials and chemicals operations we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any materially adverse effects on our business we are also a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operation and cash flows to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operation and cash flows to a material extent we are involved in an action filed in november 1998 by the city of modesto in state court in california this claim arose from allegations of perchloroethylene contamination of municipal water wells in the city of modesto and alleges certain claims against us and other chemical and equipment manufacturers distributors and dry cleaners the trial of this case is currently underway however it is not likely that jury selection will begin before late march or april 2005 we have retained counsel in this case and intend to defend this action vigorously other perchloroethylene cases involve claims of ibm employees who allege personal injury as a result of workplace exposure at ibm semiconductor manufacturing plants we are named as a defendant along with ibm and other chemical manufacturers in approximately 17 lawsuits involving more than 230 plaintiffs in state court in westchester county new york we are engaged in discussions with plaintiffs counsel to resolve this matter no plaintiffs claim in which we are a named defendant is currently set for trial we have retained counsel in all of these cases and plan to defend the claims vigorously absent resolution of these claims through discussions with plaintiffs counsel page 11 we have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in 2001 and 2002 in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our geismar louisiana plant in 2001 as of this filing 87 lawsuits involving approximately 3015 named plaintiffs have been filed a trial for the issues of causation and damages for 10 plaintiffs related to the april 2001 release was held in july 2004 five of these plaintiffs were dismissed during the trial a jury awarded the remaining five plaintiffs an aggregate award of 201000 additionally on october 5 2004 the judge granted our motion for summary judgment dismissing approximately 2000 to 2200 plaintiffs the next jury trial is scheduled for may 2 2005 in ascension parish louisiana in september 2001 we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09 mile section of joliet road that bisects our mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to repair restore and maintain the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that will further damage the road discovery is ongoing we have been named as one of numerous defendants in 225 lawsuits in mississippi and texas by 11264 plaintiffs five cases in california with five plaintiffs two cases in louisiana with two plaintiffs one case in kentucky with 454 plaintiffs two cases in west virginia with 23 plaintiffs three cases in florida with three plaintiffs and one case in ohio with one plaintiff the plaintiffs in the cases in mississippi and texas allege personal injuries arising from silicosis and failure to adequately warn related to exposure to and use of industrial sand used for abrasive blasting we produced and marketed industrial sand from 1988 to 1994 primarily in texas in the cases in california kentucky west virginia ohio and florida the plaintiffs allege personal injuries relating to exposure to silica and the cases in louisiana relate to liability as a premises owner on which sand blasting occurred the first of these lawsuits was filed in july 1993 and the most recent case was served in january 2005 most of the actions are in state court in the state in which the actions were filed however a number have been removed to federal district court we are seeking dismissal from the cases in mississippi kentucky california west virginia ohio and florida because there was no exposure by the plaintiffs to vulcans product in those states in november 2002 we received a directive and notice to insurers nos 20029 and 200210 collectively the directives from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep the njdep asserts in its directives that the respondents named therein including us are strictly and jointly and severally liable under state law specifically the new jersey spill compensation and control act njsa 58102311 with respect to certain environmental conditions that allegedly affect two former asphalt plant sites these two sites are referred to in the directives as respectively the roseland site located in essex county new jersey and the rockaway site located in morris county new jersey collectively the sites on november 4 2003 we executed njdep administrative consent orders acos concerning the two sites we agreed under these acos to complete the investigation and remediation of each of the sites and thereby resolve our liabilities if any in regard to the claims asserted by the njdep in its directives furthermore we intend to seek contribution from the former owners and operators of the sites for all costs we have incurred or will incur under the acos we never operated either of the sites prior to the sale to the current owner during the mid1990s the sites were owned and operated by tarmac minerals inc we

 item 1 business vulcan materials company a new jersey corporation incorporated in 1956 and its subsidiaries the company vulcan we or our are principally engaged in the production distribution and sale of construction materials construction materials and chloralkali and other industrial chemicals chemicals construction materials and chemicals are both reported as segments vulcan is the nations largest producer of construction aggregates a major producer of asphalt and readymixed concrete and a significant chemicals producer producing chloralkali and other industrial chemicals segment information construction materials our construction materials business consists of the production distribution and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt recrushed concrete and crushed slag a byproduct of blast iron and steel production aggregates are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 72 of the dollar volume of the construction materials segments 2003 net sales as compared to 71 in 2002 and 70 in 2001 the remaining sales in the construction materials segment result from other products and services including asphalt mix and related products readymixed concrete trucking services water transportation services paving construction and several other businesses each type of aggregate is sold in competition with producers of other types of aggregates as well as the same type of aggregates because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to the areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are the areas along the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast which are served from remote quarries by rail barge or oceangoing vessels our construction materials segment served markets in 26 states the district of columbia and mexico shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 2328 million tons in 2003 in 2003 we spent approximately 35 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included an aggregates facility in kentucky and a sales yard in texas at the end of 2003 we operated 216 aggregates production facilities located in 17 states and mexico these aggregates facilities included 162 crushed stone plants 30 sand and gravel plants 1 slag plant and 23 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business at the end of 2003 our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves totaled 106 billion tons sufficient to support our operations for approximately 48 years at current production rates in addition to our aggregates production facilities we operated 62 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select market areas for the sale of aggregates products our other facilities included 43 asphalt plants 2 emulsified asphalt plants 27 readymixed concrete plants and another 19 operations related to paving construction service and repair and transportation operations the key enduse customers for our aggregates products are heavy construction and paving contractors residential and commercial building contractors concrete products manufacturers state county and municipal governments and railroads we serve our customers by truck rail and water distribution networks during 2003 domestic and international operations served markets in 20 states the district of columbia and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 6 additional states with railroad ballast only page 2 

environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by governmental bodies regarding environmental controls which affect the construction materials industry we believe that future environmental control costs will not have a materially adverse effect upon our business furthermore any future land use restrictions could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while curtailing expansion or acquisitions in certain areas could potentially enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations we believe that the construction materials segments raw material reserves are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future we do not anticipate any material difficulties in either the number of sources or the availability of raw materials in the future the construction materials segment strives to maintain a sufficient level of inventory of its aggregates to meet delivery requirements of its customers the construction materials segment generally provides for standard payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry of payment within 30 days of being invoiced chemicals in 2003 our chemicals segment was organized into two business units chloralkali operating under the vulcan chemicals name managed our line of chloralkali products and related businesses and performance chemicals operating under the vulcan performance chemicals name which managed our specialty chemicals and services business in 2003 we completed the sale of all of the businesses and operations relating to our performance chemicals business unit see the discussion below the chemicals segment delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers on occasion when necessary to conform to regional industry practices we have sold product under various payment terms the chloralkali business  the chloralkali business unit produces chlorine caustic soda hydrochloric acid sodium chlorite potassium chemicals and chlorinated organic chemicals which are sold principally to the chemical processing polymer refrigerant foamblowing food and pharmaceutical pulp and paper and water management industries in the paper industry caustic soda is used primarily in the kraft and sulfite pulping processes chlorine is used in potable water disinfection and sewage management to remove impurities from recycled aluminum and as an ingredient to make other chlorinated products caustic soda and caustic potash potassium hydroxide are used in the production of soaps and detergents caustic soda also is used to demineralize water for steam production at electrical energy facilities and to remove sulfur from gas and coal we supply hydrochloric acid to the energy industry for stimulation of oil and gas wells hydrochloric acid caustic soda caustic potash and methylene chloride are used by the food and pharmaceutical industries sodium chlorite is an inorganic biocide and strong oxidant used extensively in municipal and industrial water treatment and environmental compliance applications ethylene dichloride edc is used in the manufacture of pvc pentachlorophenol is used as a wood preservative to extend the life of utility poles the chloralkali business units sales to the chemical processing industry serve companies that produce organic and inorganic chemical intermediates and finished products products sold in this market include hydrochloric acid chlorine caustic soda caustic potash potassium carbonate and various chlorinated hydrocarbons potassium carbonate is used in the manufacture of screen glass rubber antioxidants cleansers and other chemicals we also sell chloroform methyl chloroform perchloroethylene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons to the fluorocarbons market as feedstocks for manufacturing refrigerants the chloralkali business unit includes a joint venture with mitsui  co ltd for the production and distribution of edc this joint venture is structured to take advantage of our production capabilities and mitsuis access to global edc markets mitsui the worlds leading edc trader purchases all of the edc output of our joint venture facility page 3 underground reserves of salt a basic raw material used by the chloralkali business unit in the production of chlorine and caustic soda are located near our wichita kansas and geismar louisiana plants we own or lease salt reserves at wichita and geismar as discussed in item 2 below we purchase salt for our port edwards wisconsin plant from a number of regional supply sources ethylene methanol and vinyl chloride monomer the other major raw materials used in the chloralkali business unit are purchased from several different suppliers sources of salt ethylene methanol vinyl chloride monomer and various other raw material chemicals are believed to be adequate for our operations and we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining necessary raw materials in the 1990s the production of carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for emissive uses was phased out to a large extent because of the ozonedepleting properties of these chemicals in 2002 we completed construction of a plant at our geismar complex that produces 5cp a feedstock to make new environmentallyfriendly fluorocarbons that will replace ozonedepleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons under longterm agreements we supply 5cp to honeywell fluorine products group for its plant which is also located in geismar the resulting foamblowing agent offers environmental benefits over present ozonedepleting compounds and it exhibits comparable or superior insulation performance the performance chemicals business  in 2003 we completed our exit strategy for the performance chemicals business unit in december 2002 we sold the units municipal drinking water business to altivia corporation in march 2003 we sold the assets of the units municipal wastewater treatment business to altivia corporation in july 2003 we sold the assets of the industrial water treatment and pulp and paper businesses to kemira oy of finland including our columbus georgia production plant and research and development facility as well as production facilities in shreveport louisiana and vancouver british columbia in two transactions closed in june 2003 and november 2003 we sold our smyrna georgia production facility our dalton georgia distribution center and our specialty chemicals plant in columbus georgia to lynx chemical company accordingly financial results referable to these businesses are reported in discontinued operations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2003 annual report to shareholders pages 37 and 38 the collective impact from these transactions resulted in a small gain which was offset by an operating loss the sodium chlorite production facility was retained and transferred to the chloralkali business unit financial results by business segments net sales total revenues segment earnings identifiable assets and related financial data for each of our business segments for the three years ended december 31 2003 are reported on page 48 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2003 annual report to shareholders which are incorporated herein by reference competition and customers all of our products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance there are a substantial number of competitors in both the construction materials segment and the chemicals segment we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the top ten producers in the nation represent less than a third of the total national market resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we compete with a number of large national and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport the main competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is having a transportation advantage over competitors our strategy is to gain a significant market presence in the metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future we have facilities located on waterways and rail lines which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of lower rail and water transportation cost per unit the construction materials segment sells a small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales in the construction materials segment were 6884000 in 2003 4422000 in 2002 and 5519000 in 2001 page 4 our chemicals segment competes throughout the united states with numerous companies including some of the nations largest chemical companies in the production and sale of our lines of chemicals the segment competes principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for our products the segment also competes for sales to customers outside the united states primarily in asia south america and europe the segments net sales to foreign customers were 30956000 in 2003 27491000 in 2002 and 33051000 in 2001 no material part of the business of either segment of vulcan is dependent upon one or a few customers the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on vulcan our products are sold principally to private industry although historically the majority of our construction materials sales are used in public works relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies therefore we do not believe any material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a state or the federal government research and development costs we conduct research and development activities for both of our business segments the construction materials research and development facility is located in birmingham alabama and the chemicals research and development laboratory is located in wichita kansas in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our construction materials and chemicals products as well as the production or processing of our chemicals products we spent approximately 1440000 in 2003 1240000 in 2002 and 1202000 in 2001 on research and development activities for our construction materials segment we spent approximately 4636000 in 2003 4513000 in 2002 and 4725000 in 2001 on research and development activities for our chemicals segment environmental costs and governmental regulation we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2004 and 2005 will be approximately 7000000 and 6500000 respectively for the construction materials segment and 6000000 and 7000000 respectively for the chemicals segment certain operations of our chemicals segment are subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra under the corrective action requirements of rcra the environmental protection agency epa must identify facilities subject to rcras hazardous waste permitting provisions where past practices have caused releases of hazardous waste or constituents thereof the owner of any such facility is then required to conduct a remedial facility investigation rfi defining the nature and extent of any such releases if the results of the rfi determine that constituent concentrations from any such release exceed action levels specified by the epa the facility owner is further required to perform a corrective measures study cms identifying feasible technological alternatives for addressing these releases depending upon the results reported to the epa in the rfi and cms the epa subsequently may require a corrective measures implementation cmi by the facility owner such as implementation of a cleanup plan developed by the epa based on the rfi and cms we expect to incur rfi and cms costs over the next several years at our geismar and wichita chemical manufacturing facilities for each of these two facilities the rfi and cms results will determine whether the epa subsequently requires a cmi to address releases at the facility and the scope and cost of any such cmi with respect to those rfi and cms costs that currently can be reasonably estimated we have determined that our accrued reserves are adequate to cover such costs the total costs which we may ultimately incur in connection with discharging our obligations under rcras corrective action requirements have been estimated and accrued based on information currently available to us however there is no assurance that the actual costs when incurred will not exceed our current expectations our construction materials operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety particularly noise water discharge air quality dust control zoning and permitting and all applicable state and federal mining regulations in 1997 the environmental protection agency epa promulgated changes to the national ambient air quality standards these changes included modifying page 5 the existing pm10 standards and introduced a new fine particulate pm25 standard particles smaller than 25 microns in diameter these revised standards will eventually affect many areas of the country by requiring a reevaluation of whether the areas are in attainment with the new standards however testing jointly conducted by our leading industry trade association national stone sand and gravel association and epa has indicated that crushed stone sand and gravel operations are not major sources of fine particulate pm25 emissions as such we do not currently believe that the costs associated with compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on our operations vulcan is usually required by state or local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim its former mining sites these reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises the fair value of such obligations are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the owned or leased mining site to determine the fair value we estimate the cost of a third party performing the reclamation adjusted for inflation and risk all reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 35 and 49 respectively of the 2003 annual report to shareholders reclaimed quarries often have a future use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills patents and trademarks as of march 1 2004 we own have the right to use or have made applications for approximately 75 patents which have been granted or are pending in the united states and various other countries as well as 15 trademarks registered or pending registration in the united states and other countries these patents patent applications and trademarks relate to our businesses primarily our chemicals businesses we believe our patents patent applications and trademarks are valuable both individually and in the aggregate to our operations but no single patent patent application or trademark is material to the conduct of our business as a whole other information regarding vulcan our principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the required sources of energy for our operations in 2003 the construction materials segment employed an average of 7418 people the chemicals segment employed an average of 1192 people our corporate office employed an average of 228 people our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that weather can have on the sales and production volume of the construction materials segment normally the highest sales and earnings of the construction materials segment are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter a number of the products produced by the chemicals segment are used primarily in materials for residential construction cyclical swings in the construction industry brought on by the level of interest rates and public spending on infrastructure can impact our earnings we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding either of our business segments or our business considered as a whole investor information we make available

 item 2 properties construction materials we have 193 locations in the united states and mexico in which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our quarries and sand and gravel facilities our current estimate of approximately 10567 million tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves reflects an increase of 34 million tons from the estimate at the end of 2002 we believe that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 48 years at present operating levels in calculating the average life of 48 years an assumed annual operating aggregates production rate of 222 million tons was used see note 1 to the following table for a description of our page 7 method employed for estimating the years of life of reserves this table presents by regional division the estimated aggregates reserve life and the percentage aggregates reserves by rock type 

  

 the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation of the 193 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate 68 representing 47 of total reserves are located on owned land 30 representing 19 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 95 representing 34 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2004 to 2104 most of our leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms by renewals at our discretion due to transportation costs the market areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contribute more than 5 to the net sales of our construction materials business page 8 

  

 chemicals our chloralkali business unit operates production facilities in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin with a few exceptions the geismar and wichita facilities produce the full line of products manufactured by our chloralkali business unit the port edwards plant produces chlorine caustic soda hydrochloric acid caustic potash and potassium carbonate all of the facilities at wichita are located on a 2239acre tract of land which we own we hold mineral rights for salt which is used in production at this facility under two leases that are automatically renewable from yeartoyear unless terminated by us and under several other leases which may be kept in effect so long as production from the underlying properties is continued in addition we own 280 acres of salt reserves and 108 acres of water reserves we maintain an electric power cogeneration facility at the wichita plant site which is capable of generating approximately onethird of the plants electricity and twothirds of the plants process steam requirements we have placed this cogeneration facility in reserve and are purchasing most of our requirements for page 9 electric power from a local utility at favorable rates pursuant to a longterm agreement through a separate agreement with this utility we operate our cogeneration unit upon the request of the utility at various times during the summer peak electricity demand period selling the cogenerated electricity to the utility at profitable rates the facilities at geismar are located on a 2185acre tract of land which we own we hold mineral rights for salt which is used in the production process under a lease which may be extended at our option through 2037 included in the facilities at the geismar plant are the operations associated with the joint venture with mitsui  co ltd longterm contracts with the regional utility are in place to supply the electrical power requirements of the geismar facility including the joint venture plant in 2003 we put the geismar cogeneration facility in reserve the plant facilities at port edwards are located on a 34acre tract of land on which we own the surface rights currently we purchase our salt and electrical power requirements for the port edwards facility from regional supply sources our chemicals production facilities are designed to permit a high degree of flexibility as to raw material feedstocks product mix and product ratios therefore actual plant production capacities vary according to these factors other properties the headquarters for the corporate staff the staffs for the construction materials including the southern and gulf coast division and chemicals segments are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the majority of this office space is leased through december 31 2013 and consists of approximately 189000 square feet the annual rental for each year in the initial 5 year period the second 5 year period and the final 5 year period of the lease will be approximately 30 million 32 million and 34 million respectively additional space is leased in an adjacent building for a term of five years ending 2005 the square footage of this additional space is 6995 and the base rent starts at 136402 and increases to 159393 by the end of the term 


 item 3 legal proceedings in the course of our construction materials and chemicals operations we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any materially adverse effects on our business we are also a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits however in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position to a material extent we are involved in a number of cases as a result of our sale of the chemical product perchloroethylene among these cases is an action filed in november 1998 by the city of modesto in state court in california this claim arose from allegations of contamination of municipal water wells in the city of modesto and alleges certain claims against us and other chemical manufacturers distributors and dry cleaners the trial of this case has been stayed by an appellate court in california while it reviews a decision of the trial court we have retained local counsel in this case and intend to defend this action vigorously other perchloroethylene cases involve claims of ibm employees who allege personal injury as a result of workplace exposure at ibm semiconductor manufacturing plants we are named as a defendant along with ibm and other chemical manufacturers in approximately 17 lawsuits involving more than 230 plaintiffs in state court in westchester county new york we are engaged in discussions with plaintiffs counsel to resolve this matter no plaintiffs claim in which we are a named defendant are currently set for trial we have retained local counsel page 10 in all of these cases and plan to defend the claims vigorously absent resolution of these claims through discussions with plaintiffs counsel we have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in 2001 and 2002 in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our geismar louisiana plant in 2001 to date 87 lawsuits involving approximately 3015 named plaintiffs have been filed a trial date for the issues of causation and damages for 10 plaintiffs related to the april 2001 release is set for july 1 2004 in september 2001 we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09 mile section of joliet road that bisects our mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to repair restore and maintain the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that will further damage the road discovery is ongoing we have been named as one of numerous defendants in 133 lawsuits in mississippi by 10602 plaintiffs 63 lawsuits in texas by 1146 plaintiffs one case in california with 125 plaintiffs and one case in louisiana with one plaintiff the first of these lawsuits was filed in july 1993 and the most recent case was filed in february 2004 most of the actions are in state court in the state in which it was filed however a small number have been removed to federal district court all of the plaintiffs in these cases allege personal damages arising from silicosis or the threat of contracting silicosis and failure to adequately warn related to exposure to and use of industrial sand used for abrasive blasting we produced and marketed industrial sand for blasting from 1988 to 1994 primarily in texas we are seeking dismissal from the cases in mississippi due to the negligible amount of product sold in that state the cases are in the early stages of discovery in november 2002 we received a directive and notice to insurers no 20029 and directive and notice to insurers no 200210 collectively the directives from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep the njdep asserts in its directives that the respondents named therein including us are strictly and jointly and severally liable under state law specifically the new jersey spill compensation and control act njsa 58102311 with respect to certain environmental conditions that allegedly affect two former asphalt plant sites these two sites are referred to in the directives as respectively the roseland site located in essex county new jersey and the rockaway site located in morris county new jersey collectively the sites on november 4 2003 we executed njdep administrative consent orders acos concerning the two sites we agreed under these acos to complete the investigation and remediation of each of the sites and thereby resolve our liabilities if any in regard to the claims asserted by the njdep in its directives furthermore we intend to seek contribution from the former owners and operators of the sites for all costs we have or will incur under the acos we never operated either of the sites prior to the sale to the current owner during the mid1990s the sites were owned and operated by tarmac minerals inc we acquired the

 item 1 business vulcan materials company a new jersey corporation incorporated in 1956 and its subsidiaries the company vulcan we or our are principally engaged in the production distribution and sale of construction materials construction materials and industrial and specialty chemicals chemicals construction materials and chemicals are both reported as segments vulcan is the nations largest producer of construction aggregates a major producer of other construction materials and a major chemicals manufacturer supplying chloralkali and other industrial and specialty chemicals segment information construction materials our construction materials business consists of the production and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt recrushed concrete and crushed slag a byproduct of blast iron and steel production aggregates are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 71 of the dollar volume of the construction materials segments 2002 net sales as compared to 70 in 2001 and 66 in 2000 the remaining sales in the construction materials segment result from other products and services including asphalt mix and related products readymixed concrete trucking services water transportation services paving construction and several other businesses each type of aggregate is sold in competition with other types of aggregates and in competition with other producers of the same type of aggregates because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to the areas in proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are the areas along the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast which are served from remote quarries by rail barge or oceangoing vessels our construction materials segment served markets in 27 states the district of columbia and mexico shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 2173 million tons in 2002 in 2002 we spent approximately 434 million on acquisitions these acquisitions included 5 aggregates facilities in alabama illinois and tennessee and 5 sales yards in mississippi tennessee and texas at the end of 2002 we operated 220 aggregates production facilities located in 17 states and mexico these aggregates facilities included 162 crushed stone plants 33 sand and gravel plants 2 slag plants and 23 plants producing other aggregates principally recycled concrete reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business at the end of 2002 our estimated proven and probable aggregates reserves totaled 105 billion tons sufficient to support an average life of approximately 48 years at current operating rates in addition to our aggregates production facilities we operated 64 truck rail and water distribution yards located in select market areas for the sale of aggregates products our other facilities included 44 asphalt plants 2 emulsified asphalt plants 26 readymixed concrete plants and another 26 operations related to paving construction service and repair and transportation operations the key enduse customers for our aggregates products are heavy construction and paving contractors residential and commercial building contractors concrete products manufacturers state county and municipal governments and railroads we serve our customers by truck rail and water distribution networks during 2002 domestic and international operations served markets in 20 states the district of columbia and mexico with a full line of aggregates and 7 additional states with railroad ballast environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry either to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by governmental bodies regarding environmental controls which affect the construction materials industry we believe that future environmental control costs will not have a materially adverse effect upon our business furthermore any future land use restrictions could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while curtailing expansion or acquisitions in certain areas could potentially enhance the value of our reserves at existing locations we believe that the construction materials segments raw material reserves are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future we do not anticipate any material difficulties in either the number of sources or the availability of raw materials in the future the construction materials segment strives to maintain a sufficient level of inventory of its aggregates to meet delivery requirements of its customers the construction materials segment generally provides for standard payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry the terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced chemicals the chemicals segment is organized into two business units chloralkali operating under the vulcan chemicals name manages our line of chloralkali products and related businesses and performance chemicals operating under the vulcan performance chemicals name manages our specialty chemicals and services business the chemicals segment delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers on occasion when necessary to conform to regional industry practices we have sold product under various payment terms the chloralkali business unit produces chlorine caustic soda hydrochloric acid potassium chemicals and chlorinated organic chemicals which are sold principally to the chemical processing polymer refrigerant foamblowing food and pharmaceutical pulp and paper textile and water management industries vulcan performance chemicals offers specialty and custom chemical products services technologies and manufacturing capabilities for a variety of customer needs in a number of industries including pulp and paper and water management the chloralkali business  in the paper industry caustic soda is used primarily in the kraft and sulfite pulping processes chlorine is used in potable water disinfection and sewage management to remove impurities from recycled aluminum and as an ingredient to make other chlorinated products caustic soda and caustic potash potassium hydroxide are used in the production of soaps and detergents caustic soda also is used to demineralize water for steam production at electrical energy facilities and to remove sulfur from gas and coal we supply hydrochloric acid to the energy industry for stimulation of oil and gas wells hydrochloric acid caustic soda caustic potash and methylene chloride are used by the food and pharmaceutical industries ethylene dichloride edc is used in the manufacture of pvc perchloroethylene and methylene chloride are used in industrial cleaning applications pentachlorophenol is used as a wood preservative to extend the life of utility poles the chloralkali business units sales to the chemical processing industry serve companies that produce organic and inorganic chemical intermediates and finished products products sold in this market include hydrochloric acid chlorine caustic soda caustic potash potassium carbonate and various chlorinated hydrocarbons potassium carbonate is used in the manufacture of screen glass rubber antioxidants cleansers and other chemicals we sell chloroform methyl chloroform perchloroethylene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons to the fluorocarbons market as feedstocks for manufacturing refrigerants the chloralkali business unit includes a joint venture with mitsui  co ltd for the production and distribution of edc this joint venture is structured to take advantage of our manufacturing and marketing capabilities and mitsuis access to global edc markets mitsui the worlds leading edc trader purchases all of the edc output of our geismar facility underground reserves of salt a basic raw material used by the chloralkali business unit in the production of chlorine and caustic soda are located near our wichita kansas and geismar louisiana plants we own or lease salt reserves at wichita and geismar as discussed in item 2 below we purchase salt for our port edwards wisconsin plant from a number of regional supply sources ethylene methanol and vinyl chloride monomer the other major raw materials used in the chloralkali business unit and various chemicals used as raw materials by vulcan performance chemicals are purchased from several different suppliers sources of salt ethylene methanol vinyl chloride monomer and various other raw material chemicals are believed to be adequate for our operations and we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining necessary raw materials in the 1990s the production of carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for emissive uses was phased out to a large extent because of the ozonedepleting properties of these chemicals in 2002 we completed a plant at our geismar complex that produces hcc240fa a feedstock to make new environmentallyfriendly fluorocarbons that will replace ozonedepleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons under longterm agreements we supply hcc240fa to honeywell fluorine products group for its plant which is also located in geismar the resulting foamblowing agent offers environmental benefits over present ozonedepleting compounds and it exhibits comparable or superior insulation performance the performance chemicals business  in february 1999 we combined our specialty chemicals businesses into vulcan performance chemicals this business unit includes callaway chemical company callaways mayo division vulcan performance chemicals ltd vulcan chemical technologies llc and vulcans sodium chlorite business vulcan performance chemicals offers a blend of products services technologies and manufacturing capabilities for customers in a variety of industries with emphasis on pulp and paper and water management on march 1 2002 vulcan performance chemicals entered into alliance with apollo chemical pursuant to which apollo will perform the sales and service functions of vulcan performance chemicals textile product line in december 2002 we sold the performance chemicals business units municipal drinking water treatment business to altivia corporation we have recently announced the sale of the performance chemicals business units waste water odor and corrosion control business to altivia corporation we expect this transaction to close on march 31 2003 financial results by business segments net sales total revenues segment earnings identifiable assets and related financial data for each of our business segments for the three years ended december 31 2002 are reported on pages 47 and 48 note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2002 annual report to shareholders which are incorporated herein by reference competition and customers all of our products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance there are a substantial number of competitors in both the construction materials segment and the chemicals segment we are the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states we estimate that the top ten producers in the nation represent less than a third of the total national market resulting in highly fragmented markets in some areas therefore depending on the market we compete with a number of large national and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport the main competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is having a transportation advantage over competitors we have a significant market presence in eight of the top ten metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in this decade we also have facilities located on waterways and rail lines which substantially increase our geographic market reach through the availability of lower unit cost rail and water transportation the construction materials segment sells a small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales in the construction materials segment were 4422000 in 2002 5519000 in 2001 and 26000 in 2000 our chemicals segment competes throughout the united states with numerous companies including some of the nations largest chemical companies in the production and sale of our lines of chemicals the segment competes principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for our products the segment also competes for sales to customers outside the united states primarily in asia south america and europe the segments net sales to foreign customers were 338 million in 2002 362 million in 2001 and 363 million in 2000 no material part of the business of either segment of vulcan is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect on vulcan our products are sold principally to private industry although the majority of construction materials sales are used in public works relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governmentsagencies research and development costs we conduct research and development activities for both of our business segments the construction materials research and development facility is located in birmingham alabama the chemicals research and development laboratories are located in wichita kansas and columbus georgia in general our research and development efforts are directed toward new and more efficient uses of our construction materials and chemicals products as well as the manufacturing or processing of our chemicals products we spent approximately 1240000 in 2002 1202000 in 2001 and 1360000 in 2000 on research and development activities for our construction materials segment we spent approximately 7402000 in 2002 7177000 in 2001 and 6840000 in 2000 on research and development activities for our chemicals segment environmental costs and governmental regulation we estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2003 and 2004 will be approximately 13154000 and 8938000 respectively for the construction materials segment and 8602000 and 7090000 respectively for the chemicals segment certain operations of our chemical segment are subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra under the corrective action requirements of rcra the environmental protection agency epa must identify facilities subject to rcras hazardous waste permitting provisions where past practices have caused releases of hazardous waste or constituents thereof the owner of any such facility is then required to conduct a remedial facility investigation rfi defining the nature and extent of any such releases if the results of the rfi determine that constituent concentrations from any such release exceed action levels specified by the epa the facility owner is further required to perform a corrective measures study cms identifying feasible technological alternatives for addressing these releases depending upon the results reported to the epa in the rfi and cms the epa subsequently may require a corrective measures implementation cmi by the facility owner such as implementation of a cleanup plan developed by the epa based on the rfi and cms we expect to incur rfi and cms costs over the next several years at our geismar and wichita chemical manufacturing facilities for each of these two facilities the rfi and cms results will determine whether the epa subsequently requires a cmi to address releases at the facility and the scope and cost of any such cmi with respect to those rfi and cms costs that currently can be reasonably estimated we have determined that our accrued reserves are adequate to cover such costs the total costs which we may ultimately incur in connection with discharging our obligations under rcras corrective action requirements however cannot reasonably be estimated at this time our construction materials operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment health and safety particularly air quality and dust control in 1997 the environmental protection agency epa promulgated changes to the national ambient air quality standards these changes included modifying the existing pm10 standards and introduced a new fine particulate pm25 standard particles smaller than 25 microns in diameter these revised standards will eventually affect many areas of the country by requiring a reevaluation of whether the areas are in attainment with the new standards however testing jointly conducted by our leading industry trade association national stone sand and gravel association and epa has indicated that crushed stone sand and gravel operations are not major sources of fine particulate pm25 emissions because of this we do not currently believe that the costs associated with compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on our operations patents and trademarks as of march 3 2003 we own have the right to use or have made applications for approximately 75 patents which have been granted or are pending in the united states and various other countries as well as some 23 trademarks registered or pending registration in the united states and other countries these patents patent applications and trademarks relate to our businesses primarily our chemicals businesses we believe our patents patent applications and trademarks are valuable both individually and in the aggregate to our operations but no such patents patent applications or trademarks are material to the conduct of our business as a whole other information regarding vulcan our principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel we do not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the required sources of energy for our operations in 2002 the construction materials segment employed an average of approximately 7467 people the chemicals segment employed an average of approximately 1466 people our corporate office employed an average of approximately 233 people we consider our relationship with our employees to be good our financial results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that weather can have on the sales and production volume of the construction materials segment normally the highest sales and earnings of the construction materials segment are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter we do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding either of our business segments or our business considered as a whole investor information we are subject to the informational requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the

 item 2 properties construction materials we have 196 locations in the united states and mexico in which we engage in the extraction of stone sand and gravel the following map shows the locations of our quarries and sand and gravel facilities our current estimate of approximately 105 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves is approximately 02 billion tons more than the estimate reported at the end of 2001 we believe that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at our aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 48 years at present operating levels see note 1 to the table on page 8 for a description of our method employed for estimating the years of life of reserves the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation of the 196 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which we operate directly or through joint ventures 67 representing 45 of total reserves are located on owned land 33 representing 20 of total reserves are on land owned in part and leased in part and 96 representing 35 of total reserves are on leased land while some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally our leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2004 to 2104 most of our leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms by renewals at our discretion due to transportation costs the marketing areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table provides specific information regarding our 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves none of the listed aggregates facilities contribute more than 5 to the revenues of our construction materials business 

  

 chemicals our chloralkali business unit operates manufacturing facilities in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin with a few exceptions the geismar and wichita facilities produce the full line of products manufactured by our chloralkali business unit the port edwards plant produces chlorine caustic soda muriatic acid caustic potash and potassium carbonate the wichita facility manufactures sodium chlorite for vulcan performance chemicals all of the facilities at wichita are located on a 2004acre tract of land which we own we hold mineral rights for salt under two leases that are automatically renewable from yeartoyear unless terminated by us and under several other leases which may be kept in effect so long as production from the underlying properties is continued in addition we own 280 acres of salt reserves and 108 acres of water reserves we maintain an electric power cogeneration facility at the wichita plant site which is capable of generating approximately onethird of the plants electricity and twothirds of the plants process steam requirements we have placed this cogeneration facility in reserve and are purchasing most of our requirements for electric power from a local utility at favorable rates pursuant to a longterm agreement through a separate agreement with this utility we operate our cogeneration unit upon the request of the utility at various times during the summer peak electricity demand period selling the cogenerated electricity to the utility at profitable rates the facilities at geismar are located on a 2185acre tract of land which we own we hold mineral rights for salt under a lease which may be extended at our option through 2037 included in the facilities at the geismar plant are the operations associated with the joint venture with mitsui  co ltd and an electric power cogeneration facility which we own the cogeneration facility supplies a majority of the electricity and process steam required by the geismar plant but not the joint venture facility a longterm contract with the regional utility is in place to supply the additional electrical power requirements of the joint venture plant we plan to put the geismar cogeneration facility in reserve during 2003 and have a contract to receive power from a regional utility the plant facilities at port edwards are located on a 34acre tract of land on which we own the surface rights currently we purchase our salt and electrical power requirements for the port edwards facility from regional supply sources manufacturing facilities for chemicals produced by vulcan performance chemicals other than sodium chlorite which is produced at wichita are operated by our subsidiaries vulcan performance chemicals indirectly owns two production facilities in columbus georgia and additional production facilities in smyrna georgia dalton georgia and shreveport louisiana vulcan performance chemicals also has an office and small production facility on leased property in vancouver british columbia our chemicals manufacturing facilities are designed to permit a high degree of flexibility as to raw material feedstocks product mix and product ratios therefore actual plant production capacities vary according to these factors other properties the headquarters for the corporate staff the staffs for the construction materials and chemicals segments and the southern and gulf coast division of the construction materials segment are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the majority of this office space is leased through december 31 2013 and consists of approximately 189000 square feet the annual rental for each year in the initial 5 year period the second 5 year period and the final 5 year period of the lease will be approximately 30 million 32 million and 34 million respectively additional space is leased in an adjacent building for a term of five years ending 2005 the square footage of this additional space is 6995 and the base rent starts at 136402 and increases to 159393 by the end of the term 


 item 3 legal proceedings in the course of our construction materials and chemicals operations we are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any materially adverse effects on our business we are also a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits however in our opinion and that of our counsel the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings are more specifically described below it is our opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect our consolidated financial position to a material extent we are involved in a number of cases as a result of our sale of the chemical product perchloroethylene among these cases is an action filed by the city of modesto in state court in california this claim arose from allegations of contamination of municipal water wells in the city of modesto and alleges certain claims against us and other chemical manufacturers distributors and dry cleaners the trial in this case is set to begin september 29 2003 other cases involve claims of ibm employees who allege personal injury as a result of workplace exposure at ibm semiconductor manufacturing plants we are named as a defendant along with ibm and other chemical manufacturers in approximately 16 lawsuits involving more than 230 plaintiffs in state court in new york one of the plaintiffs claims has been settled without any participation by us thus far settlement efforts on the remaining plaintiffs claims have been unsuccessful additionally we have been dismissed summarily from a number of the pending claims we have been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at our geismar louisiana chloralkali plant in 2001 to date 87 lawsuits involving approximately 3015 named plaintiffs have been filed all of the cases are in the discovery stage in september 2001 we were named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09 mile section of joliet road that bisects our mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to repair restore and maintain the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that will further damage the road there are a number of possible resolutions of this litigation including permanently rerouting the traffic or rebuilding the 09 mile section of joliet road the traffic has been rerouted around this 09 mile section of joliet road for almost five years discovery is ongoing we have been named as one of numerous defendants in 76 lawsuits in state court in mississippi and texas by over 1814 plaintiffs alleging silicosis arising from exposure to industrial sand used for abrasive blasting which was marketed by us from 1988 to 1994 we are seeking dismissal from the cases in mississippi due to the negligible amount of product sold in that state the cases are in the early stages of discovery in november 2002 we received a directive and notice to insurers no 20029 and directive and notice to insurers no 200210 collectively the directives from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep the njdep asserts in its directives that the respondents named therein including us are strictly and jointly and severally liable under state law specifically the new jersey spill compensation and control act njsa 58102311 with respect to certain environmental conditions that allegedly affect two former asphalt plant sites these two sites are referred to in the directives as respectively the roseland site located in essex county new jersey and the rockaway site located in morris county new jersey collectively the sites the directives purport to order us and the other respondents to pay the total amount of 452000 within 30 days to reimburse costs that the njdep expects to incur in the future in connection with its cleanup of the sites tarmac minerals inc whose stock we acquired in 2000 owned and

 item 1 business vulcan materials company a new jersey corporation incorporated in 1956 and its subsidiaries together called the company are principally engaged in the production distribution and sale of construction materials construction materials and industrial and specialty chemicals chemicals construction materials and chemicals are both reported as segments the company is the nations foremost producer of construction aggregates a major producer of other construction materials and a leading chemicals manufacturer supplying chloralkali and other industrial and specialty chemicals competition and customers all of the companys products are marketed under highly competitive conditions including competition in price service and product performance there are a substantial number of competitors in both the construction materials segment and the chemicals segment the company is the largest construction aggregates producer in the united states the company estimates that the top ten producers in the nation represent less than a third of the total market resulting in a highly fragmented market in some areas therefore depending on the market the company competes with a number of large national and small local producers since construction aggregates are expensive to transport the main competitive factor in the construction aggregates business is having a transportation advantage over competitors the company believes it is strategically located in eight of the ten metropolitan areas expected by the us census bureau to experience the greatest absolute growth in population over the next decade the company also has facilities located on waterways and rail lines which increase its geographic market extensively while providing lower cost rail and barge transportation the construction materials segment sells a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states nondomestic net sales in the construction materials segment were 5519000 in 2001 26000 in 2000 and 27000 in 1999 the companys chemicals segment also competes throughout the united states with numerous companies including some of the nations largest chemical companies in the production and sale of its lines of chemicals the segment competes principally on the basis of quality price and technical support for its products the segment also competes for sales to customers outside the united states primarily in asia south america and europe the segments net sales to foreign customers were 831 million in 2001 588 million in 2000 and 582 million in 1999 no material part of the business of either segment of the company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect on the segment the companys products are sold principally to private industry although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal state county or municipal governments or agencies thereof research and development costs the company conducts research and development activities for both of its business segments the construction materials research and development facility is located in birmingham alabama the chemicals research and development laboratories are located in wichita kansas and columbus georgia in general the companys research and development effort is directed towards new and more efficient use of its construction materials and chemicals products as well as for the manufacturing or processing of its chemicals products the company spent approximately 1202000 in 2001 1360000 in 2000 and 1231000 in 1999 on research and development activities for its construction materials segment the company spent approximately 4842000 in 2001 6840000 in 2000 and 8803000 in 1999 on research and development activities for its chemicals segment environmental costs and governmental regulation the company estimates that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2002 and 2003 will be approximately 14900000 and 10055000 respectively for the construction materials segment and 5793000 and 900000 respectively for the chemicals segment certain of the companys chemical operations are subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra under the corrective action requirements of rcra the environmental protection agency epa must identify facilities subject to rcras hazardous waste permitting provisions where past practices have caused releases of hazardous waste or constituents thereof the owner of any such facility is then required to conduct a remedial facility investigation rfi defining the nature and extent of any such releases if the results of the rfi determine that constituent concentrations from any such release exceed action levels specified by the epa the facility owner is further required to perform a corrective measures study cms identifying feasible technological alternatives for addressing these releases depending upon the results reported to the epa in the rfi and cms the epa subsequently may require corrective measures implementation cmi by the facility owner  essentially implementation of a cleanup plan developed by the epa based on the rfi and cms the company expects to incur rfi and cms costs over the next several years at its geismar and wichita chemical manufacturing facilities for each of these two facilities the rfi and cms results will determine whether the epa subsequently requires a cmi to address releases at the facility and the scope and cost of any such cmi with respect to those rfi and cms costs that currently can be reasonably estimated the company has determined that its accrued reserves are adequate to cover such costs however the total costs which ultimately may be incurred by the company in connection with discharging its obligations under rcras corrective action requirements cannot reasonably be estimated at this time the companys construction aggregates operations are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment the company takes all appropriate measures to ensure its compliance with such laws and regulations and continually audits and reviews its operations and procedures for compliance environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with the companys capitalization policy costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation efforts are accrued when determined to represent a probable loss and can be reasonably estimated there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not differ materially from the companys estimates in recent years such costs were not material to the companys operations or financial condition patents and trademarks as of march 27 2002 the company owns has the right to use or has made applications for approximately 80 patents which have been granted or are pending in the united states and various other countries as well as some 22 trademarks registered or pending registration in the united states and other countries these patents patent applications and trademarks relate to the companys businesses primarily its chemicals businesses the company believes that its patents patent applications and trademarks are valuable both individually and in the aggregate to the companys operations but the company also believes that neither any individual patent patent application or trademark nor any specific or general aggregation of its patents patent applications and trademarks is material to the conduct of the companys business as a whole other information the companys principal sources of energy are electricity natural gas and diesel fuel the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the required sources of energy for its operations in 2001 the construction materials segment employed an average of approximately 7761 people the chemicals segment employed an average of approximately 1536 people the companys corporate office employed an average of approximately 213 people the company considers its relationship with its employees to be good financial results of the company for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due primarily to the effect that weather can have on the sales and production volume of the construction materials segment normally the highest sales and earnings of the construction materials segment are attained in the third quarter and the lowest are realized in the first quarter the company does not consider its backlog of orders to be material to or a significant factor in evaluating and understanding either of its business segments or its business considered as a whole segment information construction materials the companys construction materials business consists of the production and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials and related services construction aggregates include crushed stone sand and gravel rock asphalt recrushed concrete and crushed slag a byproduct of blast iron and steel production and are employed in virtually all types of construction including highway construction and maintenance and in the production of asphaltic and portland cement concrete mixes aggregates also are widely used as railroad track ballast construction aggregates constituted approximately 70 of the dollar volume of the construction materials segments 2001 net sales as compared to 66 in 2000 and 1999 each type of aggregate is sold in competition with other types of aggregates and in competition with other producers of the same type of aggregates because of the relatively high transportation costs inherent in the business competition generally is limited to the areas in relatively close proximity to production facilities noteworthy exceptions are the areas along the mississippi tennesseetombigbee and james river systems and the gulf coast which are served by the companys river quarries areas served by railconnected quarries and the areas along the us coast served by oceangoing vessels that transport stone from the companys quarry in mexico the companys construction aggregates are sold in 22 states the district of columbia mexico aruba chile and the cayman islands shipments of all construction aggregates totaled approximately 237 million tons in 2001 during the first quarter of 2001 the company acquired from empresas ica sociedad controladora sa de cv or ica for 1211 million in cash all of its interests in the companies that made up the vulcanica joint venture these companies produce aggregates on mexicos yucatan peninsula and transport and sell them in various markets primarily along the us gulf coast following the acquisition the company became the sole owner of the joint venture companies known collectively as the crescent market companies the businesses of these companies include 

 

additionally in 2001 the company acquired two aggregates facilities in tennessee and two recycling facilities in illinois as of yearend 2001 the company either directly or indirectly or through joint ventures operated 202 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities in 18 states and mexico for the production of crushed stone limestone and granite sand and gravel and rock asphalt with estimated reserves totaling approximately 103 billion tons in addition to the aggregates production facilities as of yearend 2001 the company operated a total of 60 truck rail and marine distribution yards in 18 states as of yearend 2001 the company either directly or indirectly or through joint ventures operated 31 recrushed concrete plants 2 slag plants and various other types of plants which produce fine grind dolomitic lime and other aggregates other construction materials products and services include asphalt mix and related products readymixed concrete trucking services barge transportation paving construction and several other businesses as of yearend 2001 the company operated 50 asphalt plants in 6 states and 27 readymixed concrete plants in 5 states environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the construction aggregates industry either to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries in some markets although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by governmental bodies regarding environmental controls which affect the construction materials industry the company believes that future environmental control costs will not have a materially adverse effect upon its business furthermore any future land use restrictions could make zoning and permitting more difficult any such restrictions while curtailing expansion or acquisitions in certain areas could potentially enhance the value of the companys existing mineral reserves management believes that the construction materials segments raw material reserves are sufficient for predicted production levels for the foreseeable future the company does not anticipate any material difficulties in either the number of sources or the availability of raw materials in the future the construction materials segment strives to maintain a sufficient level of inventory of its aggregates to meet delivery requirements of its customers the construction materials segment generally provides for standard payment terms similar to those customary for the construction aggregates industry the terms generally provide for payment within 30 days of being invoiced chemicals the chemicals segment is organized into two business units the chloralkali business unit which manages the companys line of chloralkali products and related businesses and the performance chemicals business unit operating under the vulcan performance chemicals name which manages the companys specialty chemicals and services business the chloralkali business unit produces and sells chlorine caustic soda hydrochloric acid potassium chemicals and chlorinated organic chemicals principally to the chemical processing polymer refrigerant foamblowing food and pharmaceutical pulp and paper textile and water management industries vulcan performance chemicals offers specialty and custom chemical products services technologies and manufacturing capabilities for a variety of customer needs in a number of industries including pulp and paper and water management in the paper industry caustic soda is used primarily in the kraft and sulfite pulping processes chlorine is used in potable water disinfection and sewage management to remove impurities from recycled aluminum and as an ingredient to make other chlorinated products caustic soda and caustic potash are used in the production of soaps and detergents caustic soda also is used to demineralize water for steam production at electrical energy facilities and to remove sulfur from gas and coal the company supplies hydrochloric acid to the energy industry for stimulation of oil and gas wells hydrochloric acid caustic soda caustic potash and methylene chloride are used by the food and pharmaceutical industries perchloroethylene and methylene chloride are used in industrial cleaning applications ethylene dichloride edc is used in the manufacture of pvc and pentachlorophenol is used in utility pole treatment the chloralkali business units sales to the chemical processing industry serve companies that produce organic and inorganic chemical intermediates and finished products products sold to this market segment include hydrochloric acid chlorine caustic soda caustic potash potassium carbonate and various chlorinated hydrocarbons potassium carbonate is used in the manufacture of screen glass rubber antioxidants cleansers and other chemicals the company sells chloroform methyl chloroform perchloroethylene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons to the fluorocarbons market as feedstocks for manufacturing refrigerants in 1998 the company first announced the formation of a joint venture with mitsui  co ltd to construct a new chloralkali plant and expand edc production capacity at the companys current manufacturing site in geismar louisiana this joint venture was structured to take advantage of the companys manufacturing and marketing capabilities and mitsuis access to global edc markets mitsui the worlds leading edc trader is purchasing all of the edc output at geismar both the new chloralkali plant and the expanded edc plant began production in 2000 in february 1999 the company combined its specialty chemicals businesses into vulcan performance chemicals this business unit includes callaway chemical company callaways mayo division callaway chemical de mexico s de rl de cv vulcan chemical technologies inc and vulcans sodium chlorite business vulcan performance chemicals offers a blend of products services technologies and manufacturing capabilities for customers in a variety of industries with emphasis on pulp and paper and water management on march 1 2002 vulcan performance chemicals announced its alliance with apollo chemical pursuant to which apollo will perform the sales and service functions of vulcan performance chemicals textile product line vulcan performance chemicals will continue to manufacture all of its textile products underground reserves of salt a basic raw material used by the chloralkali business unit in the production of chlorine and caustic soda are located near the companys wichita kansas and geismar louisiana plants the company purchases salt for its port edwards wisconsin plant ethylene methanol and vinyl chloride monomer the other major raw materials used in the chloralkali business unit and various chemicals used as raw materials by vulcan performance chemicals are purchased from several different suppliers sources of salt ethylene methanol vinyl chloride monomer and various other raw material chemicals are believed to be adequate for the companys operations and the company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials which it uses the chemicals segment delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers on occasion when necessary to conform to regional industry practices the company has sold product under various payment terms in the 1990s the production of carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for emissive uses was phased out to a large extent because of the ozone depleting properties of these chemicals the company has now developed new nonozonedepleting products to replace those products the company is about to complete a plant at its geismar complex that will produce hcc240fa a feedstock to make new fluorocarbons that will replace hydrochlorofluorocarbons under longterm agreements the company will supply hcc240fa to honeywell fluorine products group for its plant which will also be located in geismar the resulting foamblowing agent offers environmental benefits over present ozonedepleting compounds and it exhibits comparable or superior insulation performance both the companys and honeywells plants are scheduled to be operational by mid2002 financial results by business segments net sales total revenues segment earnings identifiable assets and related financial data for each of the companys business segments for the three years ended december 31 2001 are reported on pages 48 and 49 note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the companys 2001 annual report to shareholders which referenced pages of said report are incorporated herein by reference 








 item 2 properties construction materials the companys current estimate of approximately 103 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves is approximately 03 billion tons more than the estimate reported at the end of 2000 management believes that the quantities of zoned and permitted reserves at the companys aggregates facilities are sufficient to result in an average life of approximately 44 years at present operating levels see note 1 to the table of the companys 10 largest active aggregates facilities on page 6 for a description of the method used by the company for estimating the years of life of reserves the foregoing estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction based on drilling and studies by the companys geologists and engineers recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation of the 202 permanent reservesupplied aggregates production facilities which the company operates directly or through joint ventures 67 are located on owned land 33 are on land owned in part and leased in part and 102 are on leased land while some of the companys leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted generally the companys leases have definite expiration dates which range from 2002 to 2105 most of the companys leases have options to extend them well beyond their current terms 

due to transportation costs the marketing areas for most aggregates facilities in the construction aggregates industry are limited often consisting of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties or portions thereof when transportation is by truck only the following table itemizes the companys 10 largest active aggregates facilities determined on the basis of the quantity of aggregates reserves with nearby major metropolitan areas if applicable shown in parentheses

  

 chemicals manufacturing facilities for the chemicals produced by the chloralkali business unit are owned and operated by the company in wichita kansas geismar louisiana and port edwards wisconsin with a few exceptions the geismar and wichita facilities produce the full line of products manufactured by the companys chloralkali business unit the wichita facility also manufactures sodium chlorite for vulcan performance chemicals the port edwards plant produces chlorine caustic soda muriatic acid caustic potash and potassium carbonate 

all of the facilities at wichita are located on a 1815acre tract of land owned by the company mineral rights for salt are held by the company under two leases that are automatically renewable from year to year unless terminated by the company and under several other leases which may be kept in effect so long as production from the underlying properties is continued in addition the company owns 280 acres of salt reserves and 108 acres of water reserves the company maintains an electric power cogeneration facility at the wichita plant site which is capable of generating approximately onethird of the plants electricity and twothirds of its process steam requirements the company has placed this cogeneration facility in reserve and is purchasing most of its requirements for electric power from a local utility at favorable rates pursuant to a longterm agreement through a separate agreement with this utility the company does operate its cogeneration unit upon the request of the utility at various times during the summer peak electricity demand period selling the cogenerated electricity to the utility at profitable rates the facilities at geismar are located on a 2185acre tract of land owned by the company mineral rights for salt are held under a lease which may be extended at the companys option through 2037 included in the facilities at the geismar plant are the operations associated with the joint venture with mitsui  co ltd and an electric power cogeneration facility owned by the company the cogeneration facility supplies a majority of the electricity and process steam required by the geismar plant but not the joint venture facility a longterm contract from the regional supplier is in place to supply the additional electrical power requirements of the joint venture plant the plant facilities at port edwards are located on a 34acre tract of land the surface rights to which are owned by the company currently the company purchases its salt and electrical power requirements for the port edwards facility from regional supply sources manufacturing facilities for chemicals produced by vulcan performance chemicals other than sodium chlorite which is produced at wichita and port edwards are operated by subsidiaries of the company vulcan performance chemicals indirectly owns two production facilities in columbus georgia and additional production facilities in smyrna georgia dalton georgia and shreveport louisiana vulcan performance chemicals also has an office and small production facility on leased property in vancouver british columbia the companys chemicals manufacturing facilities are designed to permit a high degree of flexibility as to raw material feedstocks product mix and product ratios therefore actual plant production capacities vary according to these factors management does not believe however that there is material excess production capacity at the companys chemicals facilities other properties the headquarters staffs for the construction materials and chemicals segments and the southern and gulf coast division of the construction materials segment are located in an office complex in birmingham alabama the majority of this office space is leased through december 31 2013 and consists of approximately 189000 square feet the annual rental for each year in the initial 5 year period the second 5 year period and the final 5 year period of the lease will be approximately 30 million 32 million and 34 million respectively additional space is leased in an adjacent building for a term of five years ending 2005 the square footage of this additional space is 6995 and the base rent starts at 136402 and increases to 159393 by the end of the term 


 item 3 legal proceedings in the course of its construction materials and chemicals operations the company is subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement air emissions or water discharges as part of its continuing program of stewardship in safety health and environmental matters the company has been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any materially adverse effects on its business the company also is a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business it is not possible to determine with precision the probable outcome of or the amount of liability if any under these lawsuits however in the opinion of the company and its counsel the disposition of these lawsuits will not adversely affect the consolidated financial position of the company to a material extent in addition to those lawsuits in which the company is involved in the ordinary course of business certain other legal proceedings involving the company are more specifically described below it is the companys opinion that the disposition of these described lawsuits will not adversely affect the consolidated financial position of the company to a material extent as reported in the companys report on form10k for the year ended december 31 2000 the company settled a number of notices of violation of air pollution control requirements issued by the illinois environmental protection agency for a civil forfeiture of approximately 106000 this settlement covered all but one affected facility the company and the state have continued settlement discussions with respect to the alleged violations at the one remaining facility and the company expects to settle the alleged violations at this facility for a civil forfeiture payment in excess of 100000 early in 1999 a subsidiary of the company terminated a distribution agreement for the sale of certain specialty chemicals in four asian countries between it and phillip barker following the termination barker filed a claim for breach of contract unfair competition and unfair business practices which was submitted to arbitration in california the arbitrator issued a final determination stating that the claimant was entitled to damages attorneys fees

district court for the western district of virginia entered an order granting the motion of the company and its subsidiary to vacate the arbitration award and remanded the matter for further proceedings the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of this order with the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit and filed a motion with the district court to stay the order pending the appeal the district judge stayed the remand feature of his order pending the appeal to the fourth circuit oral argument was held in the fourth circuit on february 27 2002 these appeals will not be decided until later in 2002   the company is involved in fifteen cases as a result of its sale of the chemical product perchloroethylene which has been sold to the drycleaning and other industries as a cleaning solvent one of these matters involves environmental contamination that allegedly occurred in connection with operations of drycleaning facilities this case is an action filed by the city of modesto in the state court of california this case arose from alleged contamination of soils and municipal water wells in the city of modesto and alleges certain product liability claims against the company the case is set for trial in 2003 other perchloroethylene product liability cases involve claims of ibm employees who allege personal injury as a result of workplace exposure at three ibm semiconductor manufacturing plants the company is named as a defendant along with ibm and other chemical manufacturers and distributors in approximately 14 cases involving approximately 200 plaintiffs one of the plaintiffs claims has been settled without any participation by the company seven other plaintiffs claims are set for trial in november 2002 the company has been named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed in state court and federal district court in louisiana the lawsuits claim damages for various personal injuries allegedly resulting from releases of chemicals at the companys geismar louisiana chloralkali plant fiftythree lawsuits involving approximately 1000 named plaintiffs have now been filed of the cases filed 19 seek to certify a class 

in september 2001 the company was named a defendant in a suit brought by the illinois department of transportation idot in the circuit court of cook county chancery division illinois alleging damage to a 09 mile section of joliet road that bisects the companys mccook quarry in mccook illinois a chicago suburb idot seeks damages to repair restore and maintain the road or in the alternative judgment for the cost to improve and maintain other roadways to accommodate vehicles that previously used the road the complaint also requests that the court enjoin any mccook quarry operations that may further damage the road there are a number of possible resolutions of this litigation including rerouting the traffic or rebuilding the 09 mile section of joliet road the traffic has been rerouted around this 9 mile section of joliet road for almost four years in some preliminary discussions idot has claimed damages in excess of 30 million to settle the matter note 11 other commitments and contingent liabilities on page 47 of the companys 2001 annual report to shareholders is hereby incorporated by reference safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the matters and statements made or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 wherever possible the company has identified these forwardlooking statements by words such as anticipates may believes estimates projects expects intends and words of similar import in addition to the statements included in this annual report on form 10k the company and its representatives may from time to time make other oral or written forwardlooking statements all forwardlooking statements involve certain assumptions risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in or contemplated by the statements these assumptions risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to general business conditions including the timing or extent of any recovery of the economy the highly competitive nature of each of the industries in which the company operates pricing of the companys products weather and other natural phenomena energy costs the cost of hydrocarbonbased raw materials the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure and the risks set forth in item 3 legal proceedings and note 11 other commitments and contingent liabilities item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and other risks and uncertainties all such forwardlooking statements may be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties and therefore the statements may turn out to be wrong consequently no forwardlooking statement can be guaranteed actual future results may vary materially all forwardlooking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise investors are advised however to consult any further disclosures the company makes in future filings with the securities and exchange commission or in any of its press releases
