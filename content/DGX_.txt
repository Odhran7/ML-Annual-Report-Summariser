the clinical testing industry 

  

key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry including impacts of the covid19 pandemic which include the increased adoption of telemedicine will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends discussed in the table below present both opportunities and risks we believe that several of the trends including consolidation price transparency and consumerization are favorable to our business 

because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term in addition we believe that the clinical testing market continued with fundamental changes in 2021 first we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change in the market second we believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services third we believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare with increased cost being borne by consumers is changing consumption of healthcare services we believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lowercost highvalue providers like quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

the value of diagnostic information services 

there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare and on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management healthcare providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results table 12 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing healthcare costs

customers 

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed in table 13 as discussed in table 11 above customers are consolidating converging and diversifying in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party such as a health plan medicare or a medicaid program increasingly patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment in addition consumers are more frequently taking advantage of offerings like the companys questdirect ® offering and requesting and paying for tests themselves

  competition while there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories idnaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized advanced laboratories and providers of consumerinitiated testing in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices 



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to serve customers more effectively in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by idns which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against idnaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example idn ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to idnaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of idnaffiliated laboratories acos and dces and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology new product introductions and new service offerings competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by idns in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors faster services completion and a superior applicant experience we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices

table of contents 

integrated with the company’s governance performance management and internal control frameworks entails a formal continuous process that identifies assesses mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the company and influence its business strategy and performance the program is based on the most recent framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission which focuses on the following risk types 

• operational risk  risks arising from systems processes people and external events that affect the company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence including product lifecycle and execution service quality and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity supply chain and business disruption and other risks including human capital and reputation 

• financial risk  risks arising from the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity interest rate credit pricing and reimbursement and also to internal and external financial reporting 

• legal and compliance risk  risks arising from the regulatory and enforcement environment legal proceedings and adherence to ethics and compliance policies and procedures 

• strategic risk  risks that will impede the company’s plan to achieve its mission and vision and apply its core values including changes in the broad market and companys industry business development and restructuring activities competitive threats and practices technology and product innovation and public policy 

as part of our program we routinely assess our enterprise level risks emerging risks overall companylevel risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management and monitor the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation our board of directors actively oversees our program our primary risk factors are discussed in risk factors beginning on page 32  

billing government reimbursement we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

• “client” fees charged to physicians idns and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis 

• “patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain thirdparty payers on a claimbyclaim basis 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated our customers discussed in table 13 have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians and lack of access to patients before testing we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures 

  with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we generally must bill medicare directly and must accept the medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible and coinsurance for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to pama reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under medicare were reduced from 2018  2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement reduction from 202325 is capped by pama at 15 annually pamas next data collection and reporting period have been delayed most recently by federal legislation adopted in december 2021 which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until january 1 2023

risks related to our business 

the us healthcare system is evolving and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system continues to evolve significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the clinical testing industry beginning on page 15 for example valuebased reimbursement is increasing  eg  unitedhealthcares preferred lab network cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine digital pathology utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services 

in addition we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the market we also believe that health plans and consumers increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories idnaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices large physician group practices and providers of consumerinitiated testing idns generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many idns compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonidn patients testing idns may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the idns laboratory as a result of this affiliation between idns and community clinicians we compete against idnaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition idns that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the idns laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of idns acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by idns increased idn ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to idnaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and dces and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services in addition new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services  eg  employers government agencies 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by idns in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services one example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

pursuant to pama reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under medicare were reduced from 2018  2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement rate reduction from 202325 is capped by pama at 15 annually pamas next data collection and reporting period have been delayed most recently by federal legislation adopted in december 2021 which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until january 1 2023 

table of contents 

in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements in addition state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

reimbursement for medicare services also is subject to annual reduction under the budget control act of 2011 the statutory payasyougo act of 2010 and the physician fee schedule 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory physician fee schedule reductions 

other steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes to obtain payment increased documentation requirements limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials 

steps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos dces and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and their bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

other steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes to obtain payment increased documentation requirements limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials 

steps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards or to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and idn employees who are under the supervision of our idnbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

risks related to change in public policy 

and the regulatory and legal environment 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

• billing and reimbursement of clinical testing 

• certification or licensure of clinical laboratories 

• the antiselfreferral and antikickback laws and regulations 

• the laws and regulations administered by the fda 

• the corporate practice of medicine 

• operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate reliable and timely 

• physician fee splitting 

• relationships with physicians and idns 

• safety and health of laboratory employees and 

• handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in 

table of contents 

governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

• diversion of management time and attention 

• expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees costs and payment of damages 

• increases to our administrative billing or other operating costs 

• limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations 

• enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

• decreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed 

• adverse affects to important business relationships with third parties 

• decreased demand for our services andor 

• injury to our reputation 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments software test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories 

as the fda moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

legislation introduced in congress would enable the fda to regulate ldts in vitro diagnostics software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease the fda and the u s department of health and human services also have expressed views regarding the regulation of ldts either new law or a revised approach to regulation of ldts could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry including regulating ldts in new ways while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

pursuant to the 21st century cures act the fda issued final guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software which may be used in connection with ldts the guidance attempts to clarify whether fda approval of certain software is required it has been used by the fda in part to assert authority over the annotation software aspects of pharmacogenetic testing services 

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians idns and employer groups the majority of billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including civil and criminal fines and penalties 

table of contents 

exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion the federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in nonus markets which may vary by market and include intellectual property legal protections and remedies weak legal systems which may among other things affect our ability to enforce contractual rights trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of services and challenges based on differing languages and cultures international operations also require us to devote management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets and to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

• cease developing performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right 

• redesign or reengineer our tests 

• change our business processes or 

• pay substantial damages court costs and attorneys fees including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental

agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations these proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages 

us government rules and regulations concerning mandatory covid19 vaccination of usbased employees of companies that work on or in support of federal government contracts or other covid19 vaccine mandates could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated results of operations 

in september 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated against covid19 as required by the executive order the executive order is being challenged in courts and is currently not in effect however other federal state and local government vaccine mandates are in effect some of these mandates have application to the company directly or indirectly others do not have application to the company further additional vaccine and testing mandates have been and may in the future be announced by private parties such as contract counterparties and in other jurisdictions in which we operate such mandates may conflict with each other requirements to mandate covid19 vaccination of all or significant portions of our workforce could result in labor disruptions employee attrition difficulty in satisfying future labor needs and sanctions or penalties 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 40 billion of debt outstanding other than credit facilities in the normal course of business we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our public debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

borrowings under our credit facilities may be made at interest rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” which is a widely used benchmark for establishing interest rates globally as a result of concerns regarding the accuracy of the calculation of libor the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to no longer compel member banks to submit rates used to calculate libor after december 31 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist as a reference rate a committee established by the federal reserve board announced a new index based on overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by us treasury securities as an alternative to libor other jurisdictions have proposed different alternatives at this time it is not possible to predict the replacement rate for us dollar libor which is the libor rate that we most frequently rely on and the consequences to us cannot be predicted while we expect to be able to transition all liborbased instruments and contracts to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of libor there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so changes in market interest rates may negatively influence our financing costs and the valuation of derivative instruments 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

risks related to our operations 

the development of new technologies including artificial intelligence technologies may impact the healthcare industry and the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by idns or clinicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing for example digital pathology is an emerging 

table of contents 

technology that may change the practice of pathology information technology that includes selflearning or artificial intelligence features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry 

competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by idns in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by consumers in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists are consolidating have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site idns also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

hardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems a failure or delay in our it systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential data despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented our it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters these issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control any disruption or failure of our it systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to strengthen our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to strengthen our efficiency to promote our competitive position and to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

our business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we collect generate process or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal state and international laws or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be materially impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation in the event of a data security breach we may be subject to notification obligations litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions and may suffer reputational damage which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information including a the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and the regulations thereunder which establish i a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and ii comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information b state laws including the california consumer privacy act and similar laws in other states and c laws outside the us including the european unions general data protection regulation

the it systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyberattack or other security breach 

our it systems have been and are subject to potential cyberattacks tampering or other security breaches these attacks if successful could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our it systems andor in unauthorized persons exfiltrating and misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information including patient and employee data that we collect transmit and store on and through our it systems 

external actors may develop and deploy viruses other malicious software programs ransomware attacks distributed denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm or obtain unauthorized access to our systems external actors may also deploy programs targeting our employees which are designed to attack our it systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities through programs such as electronic spamming phishing smishing spear phishing or similar tactics as a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks intrusions and breaches failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified which could further increase these costs and consequences 

although the company has robust security measures implemented which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties cyber threats against us continue to evolve and may not be recognized until after an incident in august 2021 reprosource our subsidiary experienced a data security incident in which an unauthorized party may have accessed or acquired protected health information and personally identifiable information of reprosource patients in connection with the incident reprosource discovered and contained ransomware the company’s other systems were not impacted or compromised by this incident although the attacks we have experienced have not materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys it systems or materially disrupted the companys performance of its business the mitigation or remediation efforts that we have undertaken and may undertake in the future require the attention of management and expenditures of resources which can be significant there can be no assurance that the company can anticipate all evolving future attacks viruses or intrusions implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any security vulnerabilities if our it systems are successfully attacked it could result in major disruption of our business compromise confidential information and result in litigation and potential liability for the company government investigation significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions or with whom we interface store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information as well as those third parties’ providers are also subject to the risks outlined above for example in june 2019 the company reported that retrievalmasters creditors bureau incamerican medical collection agency “amca” informed the company about a data security incident involving amca amca which provided debt collection services for a company that provides revenue management services to the company informed the company in may 2019 that amca had learned that an unauthorized user had access to amca’s system during 2018 and 2019 amca’s affected system included financial medical and other personal information the company’s systems or databases were not involved in this incident a breach or attack affecting third parties with whom we engage could also harm our business results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and detect and respond to future cyber threats and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property patient and employee data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems we also have taken and will continue to take measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions or with whom we interface store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information in addition we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with firms that have cyber security expertise to evaluate our systems and the attacks we experience and strengthen our systems there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our third party providers will prevent contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

the supply of qualified technical managerial and other personnel including phlebotomists and processors is currently constrained competition for qualified employees even across different industries is intense including as individuals leave the job market we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical professional or other employees

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing arrangements investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

acquisitions are not all the same  eg  asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests different acquisitions offer different risks acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

• loss of key customers or employees 

• difficulty in standardizing information and other systems 

• difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure 

• failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our company has historically provided 

• diversion of managements attention from the daytoday business of our company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties and 

• the added costs of dealing with such disruptions 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

we operate facilities across the united states and consumers frequently visit our facilities in person the ability of our employees and consumers to access our facilities may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather events and natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tropical storms floods fires earthquakes or other extreme weather conditions including major winter storms droughts and heat waves whether as a result of climate change or otherwise public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other activities although we maintain a business continuity program to prepare for and respond to such events because of their unpredictable nature these events may limit or interrupt our ability to conduct operations additionally such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services these events also may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows and may continue to do so 

a pandemic caused by a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 continues to severely impact the economy of the united states and other countries around the world federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states have implemented numerous policies and initiatives to try and reduce the transmission of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business shutdowns and vaccination and masking mandates these policies and initiatives have resulted in among other things a significant reduction in physician office visits the cancellation of elective medical procedures customers closing or severely curtailing their operations voluntarily or in response to government orders increased unemployment constrained labor supply and loss of healthcare insurance and the adoption of workfromhome policies all of which have had and we believe will continue to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

table of contents 

due to the covid19 pandemic we have experienced significant volatility including periods of material decline compared to prior year periods in testing volume in our base business which excludes covid19 molecular and antibody testing and this volatility including periods of material decline could continue although we also have experienced heavy demand for covid19 molecular testing as a result of the covid19 pandemic which has had a positive impact on our overall testing volume the duration and level of the demand for and reimbursement for covid19 molecular testing is uncertain 

we may also experience an adverse impact on cash collections and labor supply and supply chain disruptions including shortages delays and price increases in testing equipment and supplies as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic a number of suppliers and manufacturers we rely upon have been experiencing and may continue to experience disruptions and delays as a result of ongoing raw material and labor shortages supply challenges and business limitations or shutdowns resulting from the covid19 pandemic which may prevent us from obtaining equipment and supplies in a timely manner or at a reasonable price the covid19 pandemic has also caused significant disruptions in transport and logistics services as a result of facility closures labor shortages or other challenges which may affect our ability to transport specimens receive supplies or materials from our suppliers or otherwise provide our services these conditions may continue or deteriorate in the future any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business consolidated results of operation financial position and cash flows 

we believe the covid19 pandemic’s adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including any variants the covid19 pandemic’s impact on the us healthcare system and the us economy the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental responses and effective and comprehensive covid19 vaccination across the us these primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control and will change over time and as a result at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the adverse impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows and the adverse impact may be material 

our business also may be impacted by changes in the severity of the covid19 pandemic at different times in the various cities and regions where we operate and offer services and by challenges faced in implementing nationwide covid19 vaccinations including the degree to which the public is vaccinated and the effectiveness of vaccines at preventing infection or illness in connection with new or existing variants of covid19 even after the covid19 pandemic has moderated and business conditions have eased we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows arising from longterm changes in behavior by consumers or other healthcare system participants and resulting from a recessionary economic environment that may persist the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows could exacerbate other risks identified in this report

our vision aspirational goals and values are set forth below 

table of contents   

we believe that our vision aspirational goals and strategy align very well with and our strong value proposition supports the triple aim of healthcare improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the cost of care 

in 2020 quest diagnostics was at the forefront of the response to the covid19 pandemic playing a pivotal role to broaden access to laboratory insights to help people lead healthier and safer lives we provided both molecular diagnostic and antibody serology tests to aid in the diagnosis of covid19 and the detection of immune response to the virus and performed over 30 million of these tests beginning in march 2020 we worked closely with federal state and local governments healthcare organizations payers suppliers retailers trade associations and other laboratories in the effort to bring as much covid19 testing as possible to the american people we also provided data on covid19 testing that we conducted to federal state and local public health authorities including the federal centers for disease control and prevention and participated in studies with government and private institutions aiding covid19 public health response and research all of our employees including our dedicated laboratory professionals phlebotomists air fleet team and couriers take tremendous pride in the role we played and worked tirelessly to help patients and communities access quality covid19 testing 

during 2020 we also saw how underserved communities were disproportionately impacted by covid19 with tragic consequences with the quest diagnostics foundation we launched quest for health equity a 100 millionplus initiative to reduce health disparities in underserved communities this multiyear initiative which will focus on people of color elderly and homeless populations in locations throughout the united states will provide a combination of testing services education programs alliances and financial support to efforts seeking to find new ways to address health disparities 

our approach to fighting the pandemic has been rooted in our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights we believe that the challenges we are facing from the covid19 pandemic have brought us together made us a stronger company and will help us capture the substantial opportunities in front of us 

our strategy 

we have a twopoint business strategy reviewed by our board of directors to achieve our vision and our goals

accelerate growth 



  



  

1 growing through acquisitions we have maintained a strategy since november 2018 to grow revenue each year by more than 2 compound annual growth rate through accretive strategic acquisitions although the merger and acquisition environment significantly slowed in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic we were able to consummate important acquisitions during 2020 our approach to acquisitions is discussed below under the heading deliver disciplined capital deployment  

2 partnering with health plans idns and other risk bearing entities to help accelerate growth we focus on large opportunities to partner with outside entities we strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by driving value with employers and providing strong value propositions for members and clinicians this includes building an information platform to help health plans manage utilization and population health and enhancing processes to help health plans keep laboratory testing in network for example in 2020 we established a strategic relationship with anthem to collaborate on a variety of outcomesbased programs designed to create an improved healthcare

the clinical testing industry 

our estimate in table 10 does not include the impact of covid19 testing 

key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry including impacts of the covid19 pandemic which include the increased adoption of telemedicine will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends discussed in the table below present both opportunities and risks we believe that several of the trends including consolidation price transparency and consumerization are favorable to our business 

table of contents   

because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term in addition we believe that the clinical testing market continued with fundamental changes in 2020 first we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market second we believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services third we believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare with increased cost being borne by consumers is sharpening focus on price disparities we believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lowcost highvalue providers like quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

the value of diagnostic information services 

as noted in table 11 there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare there also is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management healthcare providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results table 12 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing healthcare costs 



customers 

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below as discussed in table 11 above customers are consolidating converging and diversifying in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party such as a health plan medicare or a medicaid program increasingly patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment in addition patients are more frequently taking advantage of offerings like the companys questdirect offering and requesting and paying for tests themselves

  competition while there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices 



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

table of contents   

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures including as a result of pama these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories acos dces and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology new product introductions and new service offerings competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors faster services completion and a superior applicant experience we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices

billing government reimbursement we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

• “client” fees charged to physicians hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis 

• “patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain thirdparty payers on a claimbyclaim basis 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns acos dces and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians and lack of access to patients before testing we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures 

  with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we generally must bill medicare directly and must accept the medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible and coinsurance for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to pama reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under medicare were reduced in 2018 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement reduction from 202224 is capped by pama at 15 annually the lab act provided an opportunity for reforms to pama by delaying pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under pama the cares act adopted in early 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic suspended the pama price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021 and delayed pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2022 

our net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2020 were lower as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues than in recent years as a result of revenues attributable to covid19 testing excluding revenues attributable to covid19 testing our net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2020 were comparable as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues to recent years

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business consolidated financial condition revenues results of operations profitability reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 





risks related to our business 

the us healthcare system is evolving and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the aca the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the aca provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the aca also permits the establishment of acos 

certain aspects of the aca have been repealed delayed or modified the scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal amend replace or reform the rest of the aca is uncertain but if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the us healthcare system in addition uncertainty regarding the status of the aca prior to any such repeal amendment replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market 

several federal courts have issued determinations that portions of the aca are unconstitutional those rulings are net yet final 

table of contents   

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the clinical testing industry beginning on page 14 for example valuebased reimbursement is increasing  eg  unitedhealthcares preferred lab network cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine digital pathology utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services 

in addition we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market we also believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services we also believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare with increased cost being borne by consumers is sharpening focus on price disparities we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition hospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos dces and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services in addition new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services  eg  employers government agencies 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services one example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

pursuant to pama reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under medicare were reduced in 2018 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement rate reduction from 202224 is capped by pama at 15 annually the lab act provides an opportunity for reforms to pama by delaying pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under pama the cares act adopted in early 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic suspended the pama price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021 and delayed pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2022

in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the aca includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements in addition state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos dces and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer 

government payers and third parties including health plans may establish reimbursement levels that do not properly recognize the value of new and innovative solutions 

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer 

in response to requests from payers to have a strategy to report a single or at most a few codes to describe procedures used to perform molecular and toxicology testing the american medical association cpt® editorial panel has established and replaced billing codes used to report those procedures the adoption of these revised codes has resulted in limited coverage decisions on certain occasions new requirements for documentation to facilitate payment from certain payers and increased payment denials while some payers have adopted the new payment methods others have not yet modified their systems and ask that laboratories continue to report their services using the previous reporting strategies when those codes still exist 

these steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

table of contents   

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

risks related to change in public policy 

and the regulatory and legal environment 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

• billing and reimbursement of clinical testing 

• certification or licensure of clinical laboratories 

• the antiselfreferral and antikickback laws and regulations 

• the laws and regulations administered by the fda 

• the corporate practice of medicine 

• operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate reliable and timely 

• physician fee splitting 

• relationships with physicians and hospitals 

• safety and health of laboratory employees and 

• handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials 

table of contents   

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

• diversion of management time and attention 

• expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees costs and payment of damages 

• increases to our administrative billing or other operating costs 

• limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations 

• enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

• decreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed 

• adverse affects to important business relationships with third parties 

• decreased demand for our services andor 

• injury to our reputation 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments software test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories 

as the fda moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

legislation introduced in congress would enable the fda to regulate ldts in vitro diagnostics software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease the fda and the u s department of health and human services also have expressed views regarding the regulation of ldts either new law or a revised approach to regulation of ldts could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry including regulating ldts in new ways while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

pursuant to the 21st century cures act the fda issued final guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software which may be used in connection with ldts the guidance attempts to clarify whether fda approval of certain software is required it has been used by the fda in part to assert authority over the annotation software aspects of pharmacogenetic testing services in addition the fda continued during 2020 to work on a precertification program to help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software 

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  

table of contents   

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups the majority of billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including civil and criminal fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion the federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in nonus markets which may vary by market and include intellectual property legal protections and remedies weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of services and challenges based on differing languages and cultures international operations also require us to devote management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets and to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

• cease developing performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right 

• redesign or reengineer our tests 

• change our business processes or 

• pay substantial damages court costs and attorneys fees including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations these proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages

risks related to our indebtedness 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 40 billion of debt outstanding other than credit facilities in the normal course of business we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our public debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

risks related to our operations 

the development of new technologies including artificial intelligence technologies may impact the healthcare industry and the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing for example digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology information technology that includes selflearning or artificial intelligence features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry 

competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists are consolidating have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

hardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

table of contents   

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems a failure or delay in our it systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential data despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented our it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters these issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control any disruption or failure of our it systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to strengthen our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to strengthen our efficiency to promote our competitive position and to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

our business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we collect generate process or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal state and international laws or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be materially impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation in the event of a data security breach we may be subject to notification obligations litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions and may suffer reputational damage which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information including a the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and the regulations thereunder which establish i a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and ii comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information b state laws including the california consumer privacy act and c laws outside the us including the european unions general data protection regulation 

the it systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyberattack or other security breach 

our it systems have been and are subject to potential cyberattacks tampering or other security breaches these attacks if successful could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our it systems andor in unauthorized persons misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information including patient data that we obtain transmit and store on and through our it systems 

external actors may develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs including those that target our employees designed to attack our it systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities such as electronic spamming phishing spear phishing or similar tactics as a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks intrusions and breaches failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified which could further increase these costs and consequences

on june 3 2019 the company reported that retrievalmasters creditors bureau incamerican medical collection agency “amca” informed the company and optum360 llc which provides revenue management services to the company about a data security incident involving amca the “amca data security incident” amca which provided debt collection services for optum360 informed the company and optum360 that amca had learned that an unauthorized user had access to amca’s system between august 1 2018 and march 30 2019 amca first informed the company of the amca data security incident on may 14 2019 amca’s affected system included financial information  eg  credit card numbers and bank account information medical information and other personal information  eg  social security numbers test results were not included neither optum360’s nor the company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident amca also informed us that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected 

although the company has robust security measures implemented which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties cyber threats against us or our third party providers continue to evolve and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched against a potential target there can be no assurance that the company or its third party providers can anticipate all such evolving future attacks viruses or intrusions implement adequate preventative measures nor remediate any security vulnerabilities such breaches could expose our or our third party providers it systems to attack which could result in major disruption of our business and compromise our customer’s confidential information result in litigation and potential liability for the company government investigation significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business any mitigation or remediation efforts that we undertake may require expenditures of significant resources and the diversion of the attention of management 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and detect and respond to future cyber threats and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property patient data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems we also have taken and will continue to take measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by our thirdparty providers in addition we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with firms that have cyber security expertise to evaluate and strengthen our systems there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our thirdparty providers will prevent contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees  eg  pathologists 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing arrangements investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

acquisitions are not all the same  eg  asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests different acquisitions offer different risks acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

• loss of key customers or employees 

• difficulty in standardizing information and other systems 

• difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure 

table of contents   

• failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our company has historically provided 

• diversion of managements attention from the daytoday business of our company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties and 

• the added costs of dealing with such disruptions 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows and may continue to do so 

a pandemic caused by a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 continues to severely impact the economy of the united states and other countries around the world federal state and local governmental authorities in the united states have implemented numerous policies and initiatives to try and reduce the transmission of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns these policies and initiatives have resulted in among other things a significant reduction in physician office visits the cancellation of elective medical procedures customers closing or severely curtailing their operations voluntarily or in response to government orders increased unemployment and loss of healthcare insurance and the adoption of workfromhome policies all of which have had and we believe will continue to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

due to the covid19 pandemic we have experienced significant volatility including periods of material decline compared to prior year periods in testing volume in our base business which excludes covid19 molecular and antibody testing and this volatility including periods of material decline could continue although we also have experienced heavy demand for covid19 molecular testing as a result of the covid19 pandemic which has had a positive impact on our overall testing volume the duration and level of the demand for and reimbursement for covid19 molecular testing is uncertain we may also experience an adverse impact on cash collections and supply chain disruptions including shortages delays and price increases in testing equipment and supplies as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business consolidated results of operation financial position and cash flows 

we believe the covid19 pandemic’s adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic’s impact on the us healthcare system and the us economy the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state and local governmental responses and the ability to effectively and comprehensively administer covid19 vaccines across the us these primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control and will change over time and as a result at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the adverse impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows and the adverse impact may be material 

our business also may be impacted by changes in the severity of the covid19 pandemic at different times in the various cities and regions where we operate and offer services and by challenges faced in implementing nationwide covid19 vaccinations even after the covid19 pandemic has moderated and the business and social distancing restrictions have eased we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary economic environment that may persist the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our businesses consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows could exacerbate other risks identified in this report

background  clinical testing clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition screening monitoring diagnosis prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients 

clinical laboratory testing which can be characterized as routine nonroutine or advanced generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries urinalysis allergy tests and complete blood cell counts nonroutine tests may require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated informatics technology equipment or materials may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it may not be practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for many hospitals idns acos commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of nonroutine tests or to perform lowvolume nonroutine testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory which can perform these nonroutine tests some nonroutine tests are advanced advanced tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics including nextgeneration sequencing oncology neurology companion diagnostics and noninvasive prenatal and other germline genetic testing

the clinical testing industry 

key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends discussed in the table below present both opportunities and risks we believe that several of the trends including consolidation price transparency and consumerization are favorable to our business 

table of contents   

because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term in addition we believe that the clinical testing market continued with fundamental changes in 2019 first we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market second we believe that our expanded health plan network access and increased health plan focus on driving better value in laboratory testing services will reduce variation in spending on these services third we believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare with increased cost being borne by consumers is sharpening focus on price disparities we believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lowcost highvalue providers like quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

the value of diagnostic information services 

as noted in table 11 there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare there also is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management healthcare providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results table 12 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing health care costs

customers 

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below as discussed in table 11 above customers are consolidating converging and diversifying in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party such as a health plan medicare or a medicaid program increasingly patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment

competition while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices 



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures including as a result of pama these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated 

table of contents   

laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology new product introductions and new service offerings competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices 

general 

sales and marketing our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchises discussed above under the heading our strengths  and marketing organization the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers our commercial organization employs worldclass processes and tools and strong management discipline we provide industryleading training and development focus on opportunities with idns and specialty physicians and foster a customerfocused performancedriven culture we also maintain distinct sales and marketing organizations for our employer drugsofabuse testing services in diagnostic information services and our offerings in diagnostic solutions 

  

information technology we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have made significant progress implementing common systems and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations we expect that our standardization effort will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment even after we complete our efforts to standardize our historic systems future business acquisitions may create additional opportunities where we may conclude that system standardization would benefit our company 

quality assurance as discussed further under the heading quality  our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality and to meet that goal we have adopted the quest diagnostics quality program system employing root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring we continuously seek to enhance quality reduce defects further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our company 

in our laboratory operations our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens appropriate specimen transport analysis and report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers as part of our quality assurance program we utilize internal and external proficiency testing comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits we monitor test results to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns acos and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians and lack of access to patients before testing we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we generally must bill medicare directly and must accept the medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to pama cms promulgated revised reimbursement schedules for 2018  2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under medicare reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests were reduced in 2018 and 2019 and are scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10 in 2020 rates and reductions vary by test pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement reduction from 202123 is capped by pama at 15 annually in late 2019 the lab act became law the lab act provides an opportunity for reforms to pama by delaying pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under pama

the us healthcare system is evolving and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the aca the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the aca provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the aca also permits the establishment of acos 

certain aspects of the aca have been repealed delayed or modified the scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal amend replace or reform the rest of the aca is uncertain but if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the us healthcare system in addition uncertainty regarding the status of the aca prior to any such repeal amendment replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market 

several federal courts have recently issued determinations that portions of the aca are unconstitutional those rulings are net yet final uncertainty about court rulings regarding the aca could add to uncertainty in the healthcare market 

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the clinical testing industry  beginning on page 13  for example valuebased reimbursement is increasing  eg  unitedhealthcares preferred lab network cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine digital pathology utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services 

in addition we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market we also believe that our expanded health plan network access and increased health plan focus on driving better value in laboratory testing services will reduce variation in spending on these services we also believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare with increased cost being borne by consumers is sharpening focus on price disparities we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology still in an emerging state is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services one example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

pursuant to pama cms promulgated revised reimbursement rate schedules for 2018  2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under medicare reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests were reduced in 2018 and 2019 and are scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10 in 2020 rates and reductions vary by test pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement rate reduction from 202123 is capped by pama at 15 annually in late 2019 the lab act became law the lab act provides an opportunity for reforms to pama by delaying pamas next data collection and reporting period until january 1 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under pama 

in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the aca includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements in addition state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer 

government payers and third parties including health plans may not recognize the value of or compensate or reimburse us for new and innovative solutions 

table of contents   

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer 

in response to requests from payers to have a strategy to report a single or at most a few codes to describe procedures used to perform molecular and toxicology testing the american medical association cpt® editorial panel has established and replaced billing codes used to report those procedures the adoption of these revised codes has resulted in limited coverage decisions on certain occasions new requirements for documentation to facilitate payment from certain payers and increased payment denials while some payers have adopted the new payment methods others have not yet modified their systems and ask that laboratories continue to report their services using the previous reporting strategies when those codes still exist 

these steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

our business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we collect generate process or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal state and international laws or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be materially impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation in the event of a data security breach we may be subject to notification obligations litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions and may suffer reputational damage which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information including a the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and the regulations thereunder which establish i a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and ii comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information b state laws including the california consumer privacy act and c the european unions general data protection regulation 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing arrangements investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

acquisitions are not all the same  eg  asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests different acquisitions offer different risks acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 



table of contents   

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments software test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories 

as the fda moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

legislation introduced in congress would enable the fda to regulate ldts in vitro diagnostics software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease if the legislation becomes law the fda could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests if the legislation becomes law it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry including regulating ldts in new ways while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

pursuant to the 21st century cures act the fda issued final guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software which may be used in connection with ldts the guidance attempts to clarify whether fda approval of certain software is required in january 2019 the fda issued a draft guidance on a precertification pilot program to help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software 

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups the majority of billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including civil and criminal fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act and similar provision in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion the federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse

hardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems a failure or delay in our it systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential personal data despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented our it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters these issues can also arise as a result from failures by third parties with whom we do business and for which we have limited control any disruption or failure of our it systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace 

the it systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyberattack or other security breach 

our it systems are subject to potential cyberattacks tampering or other security breaches these attacks if successful could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our it systems andor in unauthorized persons misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information including patient data that we obtain transmit and store on and through our it systems 

external actors may develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs including those that target our employees designed to attack our it systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities such as electronic spamming phishing spear phishing or similar tactics as a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks intrusions and breaches failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified which could further increase these costs and consequences in december 2016 we reported that an internet application on our it network had been the target of an external cyberattack resulting in the theft of certain patient data the accessed data did not include social security numbers credit card information or insurance and other financial information and there is no indication that patient data has been misused in any way when the intrusion was discovered we immediately took steps to stop any further unauthorized activity 

from time to time our it systems have experienced other attacks viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems but each was mitigated none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys it systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

in addition certain third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions or with whom we interface store our confidential patient data or other confidential information as well as those third parties’ providers are also subject to the risks outlined above a breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability 

on june 3 2019 the company reported that retrievalmasters creditors bureau incamerican medical collection agency “amca” informed the company and optum360 llc which provides revenue management services to the company about a data security incident involving amca the “amca data security incident” amca which provided debt collection services for optum360 informed the company and optum360 that amca had learned that an unauthorized user had access to amca’s system between august 1 2018 and march 30 2019 amca first informed the company of the amca data security incident on may 14 2019 amca’s affected system included financial information  eg  credit card numbers and bank account information medical information and other personal information  eg  social security numbers test results were not included neither optum360’s nor the company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident amca has also informed us that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected

although the company has robust security measures implemented which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties cyber threats against us or our third party providers continue to evolve and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched against a potential target there can be no assurance that the company or its third party providers can anticipate all such evolving future attacks viruses or intrusions implement adequate preventative measures nor remediate any security vulnerabilities such breaches could expose our or our third party providers it systems to attack which could result in major disruption of our business and compromise our customer’s confidential information result in litigation and potential liability for the company government investigation significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business any mitigation or remediation efforts that we undertake may require expenditures of significant resources and the diversion of the attention of management 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and detect and respond to future cyber threats and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property patient data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems we also have taken and will continue to take measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by our thirdparty providers in addition we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with a leading cyber security firm to evaluate and strengthen our systems there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our thirdparty providers will prevent contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new technologies including artificial intelligence technologies may impact the healthcare industry and the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing for example digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology information technology that includes selflearning or artificial intelligence features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry 

table of contents   

competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists are consolidating have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 48 billion of debt outstanding we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our public debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees  eg  pathologists 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in nonus markets which may vary by market and include intellectual property legal protections and remedies weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing

reimbursement and marketing of services and challenges based on differing languages and cultures international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets and to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes public health emergencies and health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations these proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments the following table discusses how we believe the industry is structured 

key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends discussed in the table below present both opportunities and risks we believe that several of the trends including consolidation price transparency and increased consumer involvement are favorable to our business 

because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term in addition we believe that medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure will induce structural change that health plan approaches to laboratory testing services will reduce variation in spending on these services and that growing consumerization in healthcare is sharpening focus on price disparities we believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lowcost highvalue providers like quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

the value of diagnostic information services 

as noted in table 10 there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare there also is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management healthcare providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results table 11 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing health care costs 



customers    

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below as discussed in table 10 above customers are consolidating converging and diversifying in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party such as a health plan medicare or a medicaid program in light of healthcare reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models increasingly patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider those factors include 

table of contents   



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures including as a result of pama these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology new product introductions and new service offerings competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have made significant progress implementing common systems and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations we expect that our standardization effort will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment even after we complete our efforts to standardize our historic systems future business acquisitions may create additional opportunities where we may conclude that system standardization would benefit our company 

quality assurance   as discussed further under the heading quality  beginning on page 9 our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality and to meet that goal we have adopted the quest diagnostics quality program and use the quest management system we have a culture of continuous improvement employing root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring we seek to enhance quality continuously reduce defects streamline processes further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our company 

in our laboratory operations our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens specimen tracking analysis and report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers as part of our quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff 

in addition we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as cms cap and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs including proficiency testing programs administered by cap or states cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major laboratories including our laboratories outside the us and a number of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peerreview evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization certification for their quality management systems 

intellectual property rights   we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others we also may license our intellectual property to others in the aggregate our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business

enterprise risk management program  we maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to assure a culture of risk awareness throughout the companys key business operations and support functions our program which is integrated with the company’s governance performance management and internal control frameworks entails a formal continuous process that identifies assesses mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the company and influence its business strategy and performance the program is based on the most recent framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission which focuses on the following risk types 

   

 

 

 

as part of our program executive management routinely assesses our enterprise level risks overall companylevel risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management and monitors the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation our board of directors plays an active role in overseeing our program our primary risk factors are discussed in risk factors  beginning on page 30  

billing government reimbursement  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns acos and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians and lack of access to patients before performing tests auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal policies and procedures adds further cost to the billing process 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we generally must bill medicare directly and must accept the medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services 

table of contents   

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to pama which was implemented in 2018 cms promulgated revised reimbursement schedules for 2018  2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory testing was reduced in 2018 and is scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10 in each of 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement reduction from 202123 is capped by pama at 15 annually the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2018 

 

employees  at december 31 2018 we employed approximately 46000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

regulation 

  

key regulatory schemes   our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business including some particular to our business and others relating to conducting business generally  eg  us foreign corrupt practices act we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies the table below highlights key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 



table of contents   



table of contents   



compliance  we strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we license and maintain appropriate accreditations for all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety and compliance committee of our board of directors oversees and receives periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws and regulations including regarding billing and reimbursement and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are refunded by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments refunded the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

many of the laws and regulations applicable to us including many of those relating to billing and reimbursement for tests and relationships with clinicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science healthcare technology and healthcare organizations they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

table of contents   

violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs or federal and state fraud and abuse laws may result in civil and criminal fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed the qui tam  provisions of the federal false claims act and similar provision in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse

the us healthcare system is evolving and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the passage of the aca in 2010 the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the aca provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the aca also permits the establishment of acos 

certain aspects of the aca have been repealed delayed or modified the scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal amend replace or reform the rest of the aca is uncertain but if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the us healthcare system in addition uncertainty regarding the status of the aca prior to any such repeal amendment replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market 

a federal court has recently determined that the aca is unconstitutional that ruling has been appealed uncertainty about court rulings regarding the aca could add to uncertainty in the healthcare market 

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the united states clinical testing industry  beginning on page 13  for example acos idns and patientcentered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care valuebased reimbursement is increasing cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine digital pathology utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services 

in addition we believe that medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing we believe that pamadriven reimbursement pressure will induce structural change that health plan approaches to laboratory testing services will reduce variation in spending on these services and benefit providers like quest and that growing consumerization in healthcare is sharpening focus on price disparities we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing digital pathology is an example of this competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

pursuant to pama which was implemented in 2018 cms promulgated revised reimbursement rate schedules for 2018  2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory testing were reduced in 2018 and are scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10 in each of 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates reimbursement rate reduction from 202123 is capped by pama at 15 annually 

in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the aca includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements in addition state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer 

government payers and third parties including health plans may not recognize the value of or compensate or reimburse us for new and innovative solutions 

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer 

in 2018 cms finalized a national coverage determination for nextgeneration sequencing cancer panels under the determination tests that gain fda approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage provided other coverage criteria are met coverage determinations for other diagnostic laboratory tests using nextgeneration sequencing will be made by medicare administrative contractors clinical laboratory services providers are discussing this determination and others with cms and medicare administrative contractors to attempt to ensure that such providers can continue to provide these essential diagnostic services but those discussions may not be successful 

in response to requests from payers to have a strategy to report a single or at most a few codes to describe procedures used to perform molecular and toxicology testing the american medical association cpt® editorial panel has established and replaced billing codes used to report those procedures the adoption of these revised codes has resulted in limited coverage decisions on certain occasions payment denials by some payers and new requirements for documentation to facilitate payment while some payers have adopted the new payment methods others have not yet modified their systems and ask that laboratories continue to report their services using the previous reporting strategies when those codes still exist 

these steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

our business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we collect generate process or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal state and international laws or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be materially impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation in the event of a data security breach we may be subject to notification obligations litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions and may suffer reputational damage which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information including a the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and the regulations thereunder which establish i a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and ii comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information b state laws and c the european unions general data protection regulation

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

table of contents   

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments software test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories 

as the fda moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

in late 2018 legislation was introduced in congress that would enable the fda to regulate ldts in vitro diagnostics software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease if this legislation were to become law the fda could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry including regulating ldts in new ways and creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing new competitors may enter the industry and competition may come in new forms 

pursuant to the 21st century cures act the fda issued guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software which may be used in or in connection with ldts the guidance attempts to clarify whether fda approval of certain software is required in january 2019 the fda issued a draft guidance on a precertification pilot program to help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups the majority of billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business 

hardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems a failure or delay in our it systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential personal data despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented our it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters these issues can also arise as a result from failures by third parties with whom we do business and for which we have limited control any disruption or failure of our it systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace 

despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyber attack or other security breach 

our it systems are also subject to potential cyber attacks or other security breaches these attacks if successful could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our it systems andor in unauthorized persons misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information including patient data that we obtain transmit and store on and through our it systems 

external actors may develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs including those that target our employees designed to attack our it systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities such as electronic spamming phishing spear phishing or similar tactics as a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks intrusions and breaches failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified which could further increase these costs and consequences in december 2016 we reported that an internet application on our it network had been the target of an external cyber attack resulting in the theft of certain patient data the accessed data did not include social security numbers credit card information or insurance and other financial information and there is no indication that patient data has been misused in any way when the intrusion was discovered we immediately took steps to stop any further unauthorized activity 

in addition to the data breach reported in december 2016 our it systems from time to time have experienced other attacks viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems but each was mitigated none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys it systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

although the company has robust security measures implemented which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties cyber threats continue to evolve and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched against a potential target there can be no assurance that the company can anticipate all such evolving future attacks viruses or intrusions implement adequate preventative measures nor remediate any security vulnerabilities such breaches could expose our it systems to attack which could result in major disruption of our business and compromise our customer’s confidential information result in litigation and potential liability for the company government investigation significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business any mitigation or remediation efforts that we undertake may require expenditures of significant resources and the diversion of the attention of management 

table of contents   

third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions or with whom we interface may store our confidential patient data or other confidential information are also subject to the risks outlined above a breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business results of operations and reputation 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and detect and respond to future cyber threats and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property patient data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems in addition we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with a leading cyber security firm to evaluate and strengthen our systems there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new technologies may impact the healthcare industry and the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing for example digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology information technology that includes selflearning or artificial intelligence features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry 

competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing 

table of contents   

including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 39 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our public debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees  eg  pathologists 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in nonus markets which may vary by market and include intellectual property legal protections and remedies weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval production pricing reimbursement and marketing of services and challenges based on differing languages and cultures international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets and to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages

the value of diagnostic information services 

as noted in table 19 there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare there also is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management healthcare providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results the following table highlights how diagnostic information services can be an important contributor to reducing health care costs and improving care 



customers    

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below as discussed in table 19 above customers are consolidating converging and diversifying

table of contents   



table of contents   



in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party such as a health plan medicare or a medicaid program in light of healthcare reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models increasingly patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider those factors include 



table of contents   

we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures including as a result of pama these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchises and marketing organization the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers we have built excellence in our commercial organization employing worldclass processes and tools as well as strong management discipline we continue to invest in talent provide industryleading training and development focus on opportunities with idns and specialty physicians and foster a customerfocused performancedriven culture 

  

we also maintain sales and marketing organizations for our employer drugsofabuse testing services in diagnostic information services and our offerings in diagnostic solutions 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations we expect that our standardization effort will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment even after we complete our efforts to standardize our historic systems acquisitions of other businesses in the future may create additional opportunities where we may conclude that system standardization would benefit our company 

quality assurance   as discussed further under the heading quality  beginning on page 14 our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality and to meet that goal we have adopted the quest diagnostics

quality program this program includes policies and procedures that document measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements for clinical laboratory testing we use the quest management system including standard frameworks and methodologies for project and change management to manage our company and have a culture of continuous improvement employing root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring we seek to enhance quality continuously reduce defects streamline processes further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our company we also have a robust supplier quality program designed to ensure we have a high quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network 

in our laboratory operations our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens specimen tracking analysis and report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers as part of our quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff 

in addition we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as cms cap and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs including proficiency testing programs administered by cap or states cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major laboratories including our laboratories outside the us and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peerreview evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization certification for their quality management systems 

intellectual property rights   we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others we also may license our intellectual property to others in the aggregate our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

enterprise risk management program  we maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to assure a culture of risk awareness throughout the companys key business operations and support functions our program which is integrated with the company’s governance performance management and internal control frameworks entails a formal continuous process that identifies assesses mitigates and manages both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the company and influence its business strategy and performance the program is based on a framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and focuses on the following risk types

as part of our program executive management routinely assesses our enterprise level risks overall companylevel risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management and monitors the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation our board of directors plays an active role in overseeing our program our primary risk factors are discussed in risk factors  beginning on page 35 

employees  at december 31 2017 we employed approximately 45000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns acos and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing costs cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility increased patient financial responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense in recent years additional increases in patient financial responsibility may further negatively impact our bad debt expense the remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers in general due to the nature of our business historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we are taking and plan to continue to take steps to reduce our bad debt expense including increasing use of electronic ordering which reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information and realtime payment determination

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical testing services historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been growth of health insurance providers offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill medicare directly and must accept the local medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to pama which was implemented in 2018 cms has revised the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule under the revised medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing will be reduced in 2018 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2017 

violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs or federal and state fraud and abuse laws may result in exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs civil and criminal fines and penalties and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

  

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business including some particular to our business and others relating to conducting business generally  eg  us foreign corrupt practices act we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies the table below highlights the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses

table of contents   



compliance  we strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety and compliance committee of our board of directors oversees and receives periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures 

many of the laws and regulations applicable to us including many of those relating to billing reimbursement for tests and relationships with clinicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science healthcare technology and healthcare organizations they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam

provisions of federal and state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business consolidated financial condition revenues results of operations profitability reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 



the us healthcare system is evolving and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the passage of the aca in 2010 the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the aca provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the aca also permits the establishment of acos 

the president of the united states has announced that he favors repealing the aca in 2017 the federal legislature undertook efforts to repeal revise or replace the aca and the individual mandate adopted as part of the aca was repealed in more recent legislation some additional aspects of the aca were modified another twoyear moratorium was implemented on the device tax imposed on the sellers of certain medical devices in the us including those purchased and used by laboratories the tax on health insurers was delayed for a year and the cadillac tax on certain employee benefit plans was also delayed for two years as part of legislation enacted in early 2018 the independent payment advisory board which under the aca was to be responsible annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality was repealed the scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal amend replace or reform the rest of the aca is uncertain but if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the us healthcare system in addition uncertainty regarding the aca prior to any such repeal amendment replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the united states clinical testing industry  beginning on page 17 for example acos idns and patientcentered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care valuebased reimbursement is increasing cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis in recent years reductions in the medicare physician fee schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the aca includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress

periodically considers costsaving initiatives these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

pama is impacting the diagnostic information services industry pursuant to this legislation cms has revised the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for 2018 2019 and 2020 under the revised medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is scheduled to be reduced in 2018 2019 and 2020 pama calls for further revision of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for years after 2020 based on future surveys of market rates further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions 

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services for example since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the aca included provisions including regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

government payers and third parties including health plans may not recognize the value of or compensate or reimburse us for new and innovative solutions 

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer 

in 2017 cms issued a draft national coverage policy for nextgeneration sequencing cancer panels the draft policy were it finalized without change would effect a de facto  requirement that each laboratory test using next generation sequencing technology would need to be approved or cleared by the fda before it is covered by medicare third parties including health plans have not announced any change in approach to coverage for nextgeneration sequencing cancer panels 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing new billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing the adoption of these codes on certain occasions has led and could continue to lead to limited coverage decisions payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and healthcare providers continue to address implementation of the new codes 

these steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our

business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments software test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories 

pursuant to the 21st century cures act the fda has issued guidance regarding the regulation of clinical decision support software which may be used in or in connection with ldts the guidance has created uncertainty regarding whether fda approval of certain tests is required 

in 2017 the fda published a discussion document providing its views on legislative alternatives to regulate ldts new legislation could significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing or modifying the regulation of ldts hindering our ability to develop and market new services causing an increase in the cost of our services delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing 

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups the majority of billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters 

despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyber attack or other security breach 

unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our it systems in december 2016 we reported that an internet application on our it network had been the target of an external cyber attack resulting in the theft of certain patient data the accessed data did not include social security numbers credit card information or insurance and other financial information and there is no indication that patient data has been misused in any way when the intrusion was discovered we immediately took steps to stop any further unauthorized activity we may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation and may suffer reputational damage as a result of the data breach which could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition to the data breach reported in december 2016 our it systems from time to time have experienced other attacks viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems but each was mitigated although none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys it systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data there can be no assurance that we will be able to similarly mitigate future attacks viruses or intrusions 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of better detect and respond to future cyber threats and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems in addition we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with a leading cyber security firm to evaluate and strengthen our systems however cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

table of contents   

 

the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 38 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees  eg  pathologists 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

table of contents   

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information including in compliance with the requirements of the european union general data protection regulation beginning in may 2018 and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation we may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation and may suffer reputational damage as a result of a data breach which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments the following table discusses how we believe the industry is structured 



key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends are discussed in the chart below they present both opportunities and risks we believe that several of the trends including demographics price transparency consolidation increased consumer involvement and valuebased pricing are favorable to our business because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

customers    

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below 



table of contents   



table of contents   



in many cases the customer that orders our services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party the following table provides examples of thirdparty payers 



in light of healthcare reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models increasingly patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories in recent years competition from hospitalaffiliated laboratories has increased our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories in anatomic pathology we compete with anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider those factors include 

table of contents   



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale and marketing of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchises which are responsible for product marketing the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers we have built excellence in our commercial organization employing worldclass processes and tools as well as strong management discipline we continue to invest in talent provide industryleading training and development focus on physician specialty opportunities and foster a customerfocused performancedriven culture 

  

we also maintain sales and marketing organizations for our employer drugsofabuse testing services in diagnostic information services and our offerings in diagnostic solutions 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services 

table of contents   

depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations we expect that our standardization effort will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance   as discussed further under the heading quality  beginning on page 13 our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality and to meet that goal we have adopted the quest diagnostics quality program this program includes policies and procedures that document measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements for clinical laboratory testing we use the quest management system including standard frameworks and methodologies for project and change management to manage our company and have a culture of continuous improvement employing root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring we seek to enhance quality continuously reduce defects streamline processes further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our company 

in addition we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as cms the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs including without limitation proficiency testing programs administered by cap or states cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement act clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major laboratories including our laboratories outside the us and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peerreview evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification for their quality management systems 

intellectual property rights   we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others we also may license our intellectual property to others in the aggregate our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

enterprise risk management program  we maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to assure a culture of risk awareness throughout the companys key business operations and support functions our program which is integrated with the company’s governance performance management and internal control frameworks entails a formal continuous process that identifies assesses mitigates and manages both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the company and influence its business strategy and performance the program is based on the framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso and focuses on the following risk types 



table of contents   

quality and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity supply chain and business disruption and other risks including human capital and reputation 

  

 

 

 

as part of our program executive management routinely assesses our enterprise level risks overall companylevel risk appetite and the effectiveness of risk management and monitors the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation our board of directors plays an active role in overseeing our program our primary risk factors are discussed in risk factors  beginning on page 33 

employees  at december 31 2016 we employed approximately 43000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns acos and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing  eg  disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing costs cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility increased patient financial responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense in recent years additional increases in patient financial responsibility may further negatively impact our bad debt expense the remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers in general due to the nature of our business historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we are taking and plan 

table of contents   

to continue to take steps to reduce our bad debt expense including increasing use of electronic ordering which reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical testing services historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been growth of health insurance providers offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the local medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for diagnostic information services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year pursuant to the federal protecting access to medicare act of 2014 which is targeted for implementation in 2018 cms will revise the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule while we cannot determine the impact until we see the revised pricing schedules we continue to believe that 

the impact will be manageable the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2016 



violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs or federal and state fraud and abuse laws may result in exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs civil and criminal fines and penalties and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

  

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business including some particular to our business and others relating to conducting business generally  eg  export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies the table below highlights the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 

table of contents   



table of contents   



compliance  we strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety and compliance committee of our board of directors oversees and receives periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures 

many of the laws and regulations applicable to us including many of those relating to billing reimbursement for tests and relationships with clinicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science healthcare technology and healthcare organizations they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam  provisions of federal and state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

table of contents   

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials federal and state governments have strengthened their enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud in addition in recent years legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business consolidated financial condition revenues results of operations profitability reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 



the us healthcare system is evolving and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the passage of the affordable care act aca in 2010 the aca provided for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also included a productivity adjustment that reduced the cpi market basket update since 2011 the aca imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the us including those purchased and used by laboratories effective january 2016 congress imposed a twoyear moratorium on the device tax the aca established the independent payment advisory board which is responsible to submit annually proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the aca provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the aca also permits the establishment of acos 

the newlyelected president of the united states has announced that he favors repealing the aca in 2017 and leaders of the republicationcontrolled federal legislature also have expressed a desire to repeal the aca the scope and timing of any 

table of contents   

legislation to repeal amend replace or reform the aca is uncertain but if such legislation were to become law it could have a significant impact on the us healthcare system in addition uncertainty regarding the aca prior to any such repeal amendment replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market 

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the united states clinical testing industry  beginning on page 17 for example acos and patientcentered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care valuebased reimbursement is increasing cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved in coming years patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for their healthcare healthcare industry participants are consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers  eg  physician assistants in nontraditional venues  eg  retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies  eg  telemedicine utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals increased hospital ownership of physician practices enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services that are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis in recent years reductions in the medicare physician fee schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the aca includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements recently state budget pressures 

table of contents   

have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

2014 us federal legislation the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 is impacting the clinical testing industry key parts of this legislation included provisions that provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a marketbased process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule currently it is anticipated that the new fee schedule would be come effective in 2018 if this process does not recognize the value that clinical testing services bring to the healthcare system our business can be materially adversely impacted 

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services for example since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the aca included provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

government payers and third parties including health plans may not recognize the value of or compensate or reimburse us for new and innovative solutions 

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer these steps discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our 

table of contents   

business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their scrutiny and enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has published a discussion document that provides the fdas views on legislation to govern ldts new legislation could significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing or modifying the regulation of ldts hindering our ability to develop and market new services causing an increase in the cost of our services delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing 

failure to accurately bill for our services or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups effective commencing in november 2016 billing and related operations for our company are being provided by a third party under the companys oversight failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures system conversion or standardization initiatives human acts and natural disasters 

despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to unauthorized tampering cyber attack or other security breach 

unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our it systems in december 2016 we reported that an internet application on our it network had been the target of an external cyber attack resulting in the theft of certain patient data the accessed data did not include social security numbers credit card information or insurance and other financial information and there is no indication that patient data has been misused in any way when the intrusion was discovered we immediately took steps to stop any further unauthorized activity we may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation and may suffer reputational damage as a result of the data breach which could have an adverse impact on our business 

in addition to the data breach reported in december 2016 our it systems from time to time have experienced other minor attacks minor viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems like other major companies but each was mitigated and none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys it systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

we have taken and continue to take precautionary measures to prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems in addition we are working with law enforcement as well as a leading cyber security firm to investigate and further evaluate and strengthen our systems and continue to strengthen precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and to detect and respond to future cyber threats however cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 



table of contents   

 

the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some nonroutine and advanced testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 37 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees  eg  pathologists 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

table of contents   

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation in december 2016 we reported that an internet application on our it network had been the target of an external cyber attack resulting in the theft of certain patient data we may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation and may suffer reputational damage as a result of a data breach which could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for tests 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing the adoption of these codes is allowing payers to better determine tests being performed this has led and could continue to lead to limited coverage decisions payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment health plans medicare contractors and medicaid programs continue to consider or implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and healthcare providers continue to address implementation of the new codes

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages

background  clinical testing   

clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition screening monitoring diagnosis prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services 

  clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include blood chemistries urinalysis allergy tests and complete blood cell counts 

esoteric tests are more advanced clinical laboratory tests that are not routine esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics including nextgeneration sequencing protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology these tests may require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals idns acos commercial laboratories or physician office

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments the following table discusses how we believe the industry is structured

key trends 

the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because diagnostic information service is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry

customers    

we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including those discussed below 



table of contents   



table of contents   



in many cases the customer that orders the services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party increasingly even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment patients may bear responsibility for a portion of the payment the following table provides examples of thirdparty payers 



in light of health care reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models increasingly patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices in recent years competition from hospitalaffiliated laboratories has increased our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories as well as manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions there also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider those factors include 

table of contents   



we believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a positive customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more or more convenient locations in a market as a result we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability quality and pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the diagnostic products risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products industry through unique and differentiated products we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale and marketing of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchise organizations which are responsible for product marketing the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to ensure aligned delivery for our customers we maintain a separate sales and marketing organization for our employer drugsofabuse testing services 

in diagnostic solutions we maintain separate sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products healthcare information technology solutions and risk assessment services 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services 

table of contents   

depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to implement more common laboratory information and billing systems across our operations to standardize our processes we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance  in our diagnostic information services business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting the quest diagnostics quality program includes policies and procedures to document measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting the requirements of the agencies that regulate the us clinical laboratory testing industry the quality program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to proactively identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems we track and seek to improve on medical quality and service metrics 

our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens specimen tracking report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry we continue to implement initiatives to enhance our quality and standardization using our bestinclass business performance tools in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification for their quality management systems 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our diagnostic information services for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as cms the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement act clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our laboratories outside the us and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peerreview evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs 

our diagnostic products business maintains extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states and other countries it is regulated by the fda and is required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the united states in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations 

intellectual property rights   we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

table of contents   

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

  

employees  at december 31 2015 we employed approximately 44000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing costs cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility in recent years increased patient responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense to the extent that health plans and other programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact our bad debt expense we are taking and plan to continue to take steps to improve our patient collection experience 

the remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers in general due to the nature of our business historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been growth of health insurance providers offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements 

table of contents   

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the local medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for diagnostic information services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year for 2016 each schedule is changing and reimbursement under each schedule will be different in 2016 than 2015 levels the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare and medicaid in 2015 



violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs or federal and state fraud and abuse laws may result in exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs civil and criminal fines and penalties and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal false claims act including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

  

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business including some particular to our business and others relating to conducting business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies the table below highlights the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 



table of contents   



table of contents   



compliance  we strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement for tests and relationships with clinicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science healthcare technology and healthcare organizations such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam  provisions of federal and state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud in addition in recent years legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 

table of contents   

provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business consolidated financial condition revenues results of operations profitability reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 



the us healthcare system is evolving and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to the passage of the affordable care act aca in 2010 the law provided for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also included a productivity adjustment that reduced the cpi market basket update since 2011 the law imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the us including those purchased and used by laboratories effective january 2016 congress imposed a twoyear moratorium on the device tax the law established the independent payment advisory board which is responsible to submit annually proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the aca established the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the law provided for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the law also permits the establishment of acos 

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the united states clinical testing industry  beginning on page 14 for example acos and patientcentered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care valuebased reimbursement is increasing cms has set goals for valuebased reimbursement to be achieved in coming years healthcare industry participants are consolidating healthcare services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers eg physician assistants in nontraditional venues eg retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies eg telemedicine we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance clinician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis in recent years reductions in the medicare physician fee schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility denying claims and service coverage restrictions 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services copayments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

2014 us federal legislation the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 is impacting the clinical testing industry key parts of this legislation included provisions that provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a marketbased process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule if this process does not recognize the value that clinical testing services bring to the healthcare system our business can be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents   

health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services for example since the passage of aca there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the aca included provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

government payers and third parties including health plans may not recognize the value of or compensate or reimburse us for new and innovative solutions 

government payers and third parties including health plans are taking steps to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for some new and innovative healthcare solutions including new tests and other solutions that we may offer these steps discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others

table of contents   

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their scrutiny and enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion moreover even when an 

table of contents   

investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the us a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business including the application of medical device excise taxes to our business the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new services cause an increase in the cost of our services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing 

failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid clinicians hospitals and employer groups failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business 

attacks on our information technology systems or failure in these systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our it systems moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions computer viruses unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems our information technology systems from time to time have experienced minor attacks minor viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems like other major companies but each was mitigated and none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys information technology systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

we have taken precautionary measures to prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems in addition we continue to strengthen precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and to detect and respond to future cyber threats however cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business 

we are planning to implement common laboratory information and billing systems which will promote standardized processes we expect that this effort will take several years to complete and may result in temporary disruptions in service

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some esoteric testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 37 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

table of contents   

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees eg pathologists at our clinical laboratories or research centers 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for tests 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing the adoption of these codes is allowing payers to better determine tests being performed this has led and could continue to lead to limited coverage decisions payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment health plans medicare contractors and medicaid programs continue to consider or implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and healthcare providers continue to address implementation of the new codes 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set was implemented october 1 2015 clinicians may fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests and our claims for reimbursement using the new codes may be denied further delays in billing historically have resulted in increased costs and decreased collection of payment 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in the us healthcare system including healthcare utilization and increased patient financial responsibility for services 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the united states trends in the utilization of the us healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as underemployed workers decisions to delay medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care declining utilization of the us healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services 

in the current environment patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased financial responsibility for their healthcare our operations also may be adversely impacted by the recent trend to increased patient responsibility for payment for healthcare services including diagnostic information services

our strategy and strengths 

in 2012 quest diagnostics launched a new vision goals and strategy our vision is 

empowering better health with diagnostic insights 

we have three aspirational goals 

 

our values are quality integrity accountability innovation collaboration and leadership 

our strategy    

at our firstever investor day in november 2012 we introduced a fivepoint business strategy to help us achieve our vision and our goals as 2013 concluded we revised the priority of the five points in the strategy establishing restoring growth as our top priority in 2014 we executed our strategy and at our second investor day in november 2014 we shared our progress on the strategy and the commitments that we made at our investor day in november 2012 reaffirmed our strategy and outlined our path forward 

our five point strategy is 

 

the discussion below focuses on our fivepoint strategy and our path forward 

1 restore growth  we are pursuing seven opportunities to restore growth three of these opportunities have a nearterm focus sales and marketing excellence grow esoteric testing through a disease focus and provide professional lab services to hospitals and idns the remaining four opportunities have a longerterm focus lead in precision medicine create value from information assets leverage capabilities into extended care settings and succeed internationally 

since 2012 our efforts to foster sales and marketing excellence have progressed we now maintain one commercial organization in our diagnostic information services business centrally led and focused on local customer needs we employ worldclass management discipline around processes tools and measurement we are investing in talent providing sustained training and focusing on specialty opportunities and have instilled a customerfocused performancedriven culture 

we plan to grow by pursuing strategic partnerships with hospitals and idns we believe that continued price transparency cost and utilization pressure and evolving healthcare payment models will drive demand for our expertise in a range of strategic partnerships we offer a range of solutions including reference testing supply chain management lab management outsourcing outreach acquisition other business solutions and joint ventures we can help our partners to succeed including by consolidating data and delivering insights delivering test management solutions to improve care and help control cost and by providing patientfocused programs to enable effective management of care we announced and implemented six new professional lab services relationships over the past year 

in addition we plan to grow esoteric testing revenues by creating value through scientific and product innovation and delivering comprehensive solutions for major clinical opportunities we are more than just a laboratory we seek to offer solutions using data information services and strategies that enable our customers to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals starting with a clinical focus on a specific disease state or clinical problem we pursue opportunities to create value by providing holistic solutions centered on evidencesupported standards of care and to combine routine guideline mandated testing with esoteric solutions we take advantage of advanced technology for more precise comprehensive and useful information and integrate our extensive clinical data to help manage populations and target health care solutions 

our clinical franchise organizations working with our research and development team focus on these opportunities and coordinate with our commercial organization to deliver new and improved solutions the eight clinical franchise 

table of contents   

organizations focus on cancer cardiovascular metabolic and endocrinology infectious disease and immunology neurology prescription drug monitoring and toxicology sports diagnostics general health and wellness and womens and reproductive health our franchises are designed to enable us to act like a boutique service provider while maintaining the advantages of our scale and identify and tap growing market segments so that we more wisely deploy our resources and target opportunities 

our comprehensive solutions for hepatitis c from screening to treatment and monitoring the growth of our prescription drug monitoring and general health and wellness businesses and as we enter the era of precision medicine the 2014 launch of our oncovantage tm  solution in partnership with memorial sloan kettering cancer center are recent examples of our strategy and the power of our clinical franchises to help us deliver new solutions and grow organically 

in 2013 we launched a multiyear initiative project restore to identify prioritize resource and implement a wide range of activities designed to create consistent profitable growth for example the program leverages centralized analytics and best practice teams to improve sales and marketing effectiveness reduce attrition and bring to local teams lessons learned across the enterprise the investments that weve made and our efforts to improve our sales and marketing effectiveness grow esoteric testing through our clinical franchise organizations and pursue strategic partnerships with hospitals acos and idns have yielded positive results in 2014 we restored growth primarily through acquisitions our goal is to achieve and ultimately exceed market growth rates 

2 drive operational excellence   to enhance operational excellence we are focused on delivering a superior customer experience and driving cost excellence across every portion of our value chain from the time that we receive an order until the time we receive payment including in our supporting operations improving our operations will yield many benefits including enhancing customer satisfaction employee engagement and shareholder value improving our quality and competitiveness and strengthening our foundation for growth 

we have made strong progress driving operational excellence improving our quality and efficiency and improving our overall customer experience for example since 2012 we have consolidated contact centers by nearly 75 and enhanced our supply chain management resulting in improved performance and greater efficiencies the 2014 opening of our new laboratory facility in marlborough ma consolidating work from multiple legacy labs onto a standard more efficient stateoftheart platform is an example of the opportunities that we see to drive operational excellence 

our cost excellence program invigorate has consisted of several flagship programs with structured plans in each to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain these flagship programs include organization excellence information technology excellence procurement excellence service excellence lab excellence and billing excellence invigorate delivered more than 200 million in realized savings in 2014 we also exited 2014 with runrate savings of more than 700 million compared to 2011 surpassing the updated invigorate goal of 600 million goal in runrate savings by the end of 2014 compared to 2011 

in november 2014 we announced a goal to deliver an additional 600 million in runrate savings as we exit 2017 achieving this goal would bring the total savings from the invigorate initiative to 13 billion in runrate savings compared to 2011 in addition to flagship program opportunities we identified new key opportunities to change how we operate in order to meet this goal these new key opportunities include standardizing our processes information technology systems equipment and data enhancing electronic enabling services and enhancing reimbursement for work we perform we believe that our efforts to standardize our information technology systems equipment and data also will foster our efforts to restore growth supporting the value creation initiatives of our clinical franchises by enhancing our operational flexibility empowering and enhancing the customer experience facilitating the delivery of actionable insights and bolstering our large data platform 

3 simplify the organization to enable growth and productivity   in 2012 we concluded that our organization was not structured to align well with our objectives previously the organization was too complex and it failed to let the company take advantage of its scale and capabilities in 2013 and 2014 we revised our senior management team it now is composed of both executives who joined the company prior to our current president and chief executive officer and executives who joined thereafter we also restructured our organization to eliminate silos in our core business provide for leadership in defined geographies and eliminate three unnecessary management layers our new organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities to align upstream and downstream units in our business for seamless execution and to leverage our companywide infrastructure to gain more capability value and efficiency 

we introduced the quest management system to manage our company this system not only provides a foundation for daytoday management including bestinclass business performance tools but also helps us to develop the capabilities that we need to manage the company the system supports our efforts as we build a highperformance culture with employees focused on behaviors to make us more agile transparent customerfocused collaborative and performance oriented we 

table of contents   

continue to simplify the organization and our processes to better focus on our customers speed decisionmaking and to empower employees 

4 refocus on diagnostic information services we have a sharp focus on diagnostic information services since 2012 we have sold our oraldna salivary diagnostics business our hemocue and enterix diagnostic products businesses and ibrutinib royalty rights generating approximately 800 million of proceeds we continue to consider options for several other assets including our products businesses 

5 deliver disciplined capital deployment and strategically aligned accretive acquisitions  we are focused on increasing shareholder returns and returns on invested capital “roic” through a framework that encompasses improving operating performance and disciplined capital deployment 

our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends share repurchases and investment in our business and is intended to improve roic the framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating we expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases consistent with that expectation in january 2015 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 15 from 033 per common share to 038 per common share this represents our fourth increase in the dividend since 2011 we believe that the dividend can grow over time we also believe that opportunities may arise to return incremental capital to shareholders from free cash flow as a result of portfolio actions since 2012 we have returned more than 1 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock 

we will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner we have established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities we expect to generate 1 to 2 percent revenue growth per year through valuecreating strategicallyaligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria we screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations including value creation roic and impact on our earnings since 2012 we have invested approximately 1 billion in seven acquisitions in 2014 we closed acquisitions of solstas lab partners significantly expanding our diagnostic information services business in the southeastern united states and summit health expanding our health and wellness services 

our additional nearterm investments in growth are likely to focus on investments in innovation in the form of licensing collaborations and internal development to grow esoteric testing tools to support commercial excellence and project restore we also expect to make investments to improve operational excellence including for example systems standardization and automation footprint optimization and project invigorate 

our strengths 

we offer high value diagnostic information services and diagnostic solutions including those grounded in pathology and genebased and esoteric testing that are attractive to patients physicians hospitals health plans idns acos employers and others we believe that customers and payers prefer providers that offer a comprehensive and innovative range of tests and services and the most convenient access to those services and that by offering such services we strengthen our market offering market position and reputation

background  clinical testing   

clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical testing to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services 

  clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include blood chemistries urinalysis allergy tests and complete blood cell counts 

esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests that are not routine esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology these tests may require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals idns acos commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory which specializes in performing these complex tests commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests genebased tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen 

anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues such as biopsies and other samples such as human cells anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients

diagnostic products     

we develop and manufacture products that enable healthcare professionals to make healthcare diagnoses we offer these products to a broad spectrum of customers in the united states and through distributors in other countries 

 focus diagnostics develops manufactures and markets diagnostic products which can be performed on a variety of instrument platforms focus diagnostics product lines include simplexa ®  molecular chemistries with a focus on infectious disease and hospitalacquired infections herpeselect ®  hsv serology and a line of dxselect tm  ifa and elisa products for testing for emerging infectious diseases focus diagnostics maintains a global distribution agreement with 3m corporation to bring realtime polymerase chain reaction products to the market using simplexa ®  molecular chemistries and the 3m tm  integrated cycler a compact benchtop instrument 

celera diagnostics offers a number of high complexity molecular diagnostic products in segments such as hiv1 drug resistance testing under the viroseq ®  brand reproductive genetics and transplantation under the atria tm  and alleleseqr ®  brands 

healthcare information technology   

we provide interoperable technologies that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter share and access clinical information without costly information technology implementation or significant workflow disruption 

  our care360 ® ehr product allows physicians to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter automates and streamlines the clinicians workflow and allows for rapid deployment and implementation with minimal workflow disruption the solution allows doctors to electronically create manage and distribute patient encounter notes and allows for patient communication via a patient portal it captures lab and radiology results provides clinical decision support tools and allows doctors to send secure messages and clinical information to other practitioners and secure laboratory results to patients personal health records 

chartmaxx ®  is our enterprise content management system for hospitals clients have contracted for its use at over 225 sites in north america to enable clinical and business workflows 

noncommercial development state drug assets 

as a result of its 2011 acquisition of celera corporation the company also has an interest in noncommercial development state drug assets the company is evaluating options with respect to these interests 

we have an agreement with merck  co inc merck under which merck has a license to our intellectual property for the development of among other things small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin k this agreement was entered into by a predecessor of celera that celera acquired in november 2001 under the agreement we are entitled to receive future milestone payments based on development progress for each potential product under the agreement we are also entitled to receive single digit royalty payments from the sale of drugs if any resulting from the program this drug development program entered phase iii clinical trials in september 2007 and merck has disclosed its intent to file a new drug application in 2015 we do not control the development activities conducted by merck merck may not successfully develop or commercialize any compounds covered by the agreement and may not obtain needed regulatory approvals and we may not receive any further payments under this agreement 

the company may be entitled to milestone payments associated with the small molecule drug discovery and development programs sold by celera to pharmacyclics inc in 2006 these programs are for the treatment of cancer and other diseases including programs that target histone deactylase factor viia and b cell tyrosine kinases involved in immune function in addition we will be entitled to royalty payments in the single digits based on annual sales of any drugs other than ibrutinib commercialized from the three programs if any in 2013 we sold the rights to royalties from ibrutinib we have not received any royalty payments related to these programs 

we have no direct control over the amount or timing of resources devoted to any of these programs the programs may never meet the specified milestones or the programs may be terminated and therefore may never generate milestone payments also even if some milestones are met there is no assurance that these programs will result in any product sales that would generate royalty payments to us 

table of contents   

our small molecule program agreements will remain in effect for as long as any royalties are payable under the respective agreements the obligation to pay royalties generally coincides with the life of the underlying patents each of the third parties with which we have agreements are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a therapeutic product and to pay us amounts due under the terms of the agreements including milestone andor royalty payments promptly after the amounts become payable these agreements generally are terminable upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by either party in addition merck may terminate its agreement with us for any reason upon advance written notice but would lose its license from us and would not be able to commercialize any product under the license 

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments one segment which we believe makes up approximately 40 of the total industry includes hospital inpatient and outpatient testing the second segment which we believe makes up approximately 60 of the total industry includes testing of persons who are not hospital patients including testing done in commercial clinical laboratories physicianoffice laboratories and other locations as well as hospital outreach testing within the second segment we believe that hospital outreach has been increasing share in the last few years we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the total industry commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories and other locations account for the balance 

key trends  the healthcare system in the united states is evolving significant change is taking place in the system we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because diagnostic information service is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

demographics  as the population continues to grow and age the burden of chronic diseases and unmet diagnostic needs may increase the demand for diagnostic information services 

prevention and wellness  we believe that the value of detection prevention wellness and personalized care now is well recognized consumers employers acos idns health plans and government agencies increasingly focus on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive care that helps avoid disease health care providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results there is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management health care providers consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment 

medical innovation  medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing advances in genomics and proteomics are expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for precision medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing and in which data information services and strategies are used to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and health care providers by improving clinical decision support access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management population health management and improving clinical outcomes there is increasing focus on access to patient data and datadriven insights 

customers and payers  our customers and payers including physicians health plans idns acos employers and others have been consolidating and diversifying for example an increased number of hospital systems are considering establishing or have established health insurance plans and health insurance plans increasingly are considering providing or are providing healthcare services consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power and encouraging internalization of clinical testing physicians increasingly are employed by hospital systems idns acos or large group practices integrated with healthcare systems instead of organizing physicianowned practices which is changing the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed by a hospital or a nonhospital valuebased reimbursement is contributing to changes in the healthcare system acos and patientcentered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care health care services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers eg physician assistants in nontraditional venues eg retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies eg telemedicine in addition federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of acos and requires implementation of health insurance 

table of contents   

 exchanges which is resulting in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the united states patients are also our customers increasingly patients are engaged in their own healthcare and are bearing responsibility for payment for the services that we provide to them 

pricing transparency  there has been a trend toward greater pricing transparency in the healthcare marketplace this transparency combined with increased patient financial responsibility for medical care is enhancing purchasing sophistication and changes in behavior in the health care marketplace 

  

competition  the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position new industry entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations 

reimbursement pressure  there is a strong focus in the united states on controlling the overall cost of healthcare healthcare market participants including governments are focusing on controlling costs including potentially by changing reimbursement for healthcare services including but not limited to a shift from fee for service to capitation revising test coding changing medical coverage policies eg healthcare benefits design preauthorization of lab testing requiring copays introducing lab spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as acos and patientcentered medical homes in light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical testing services while pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our company it also creates opportunities such as an opportunity for increased proper utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare we believe that it also creates greater opportunities for high value lowcost providers like our company as compared to other providers 

healthcare utilization  in the past few years growth in healthcare utilization in the united states has varied there may be many factors contributing to this result including sluggish employment growth underemployment in the work force patients delaying medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care however federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient costsharing for preventive services and additional provisions that we believe have increased the number of patients that have health insurance including medicaid and thus better access to diagnostic testing 

legislative regulatory and policy environment  government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing healthcare payment reform is a top issue the fda has announced guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests ldts federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to changes for example approximately half of the states have opted in to medicaid expansion and employers may discontinue offering group health insurance to their employees shifting more people to exchange products 

globalization  there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems outside the united states demographic changes globally also may create opportunities 

informatics  the increased availability of healthcare data including data made available as a result of next generation dna sequencing and the increased ability to effectively analyze that data at population and patient levels is impacting healthcare practices informatics including integrated diagnostic and decision support solutions use of population data and healthcare information technology is spurring advances in precision medicine including medical decision making and value for populations and individuals healthcare market participants including pharmaceutical companies health plans physicians acos and hospitals are striving to leverage interoperability informatics and analytics to positively influence the health of patient populations 

customers    we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including physicians hospitals idns acos health plans patients and employers in many cases the customer that orders the services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party in some cases even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment patients may bear responsibility for a portion of the payment examples of potential thirdparty payers include health plans selfinsured employer benefit funds acos idns patientcentered medical homes the traditional medicare or medicaid program physicians or others eg a hospital another laboratory or an employer in light of health care reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models increasingly patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them 

table of contents   

health plans  health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for diagnostic information services performed reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled less than 20 and no one health plan accounted for 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2014 

health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from diagnostic information services the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain locations health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” or other alternative delivery systems eg physician hospital organizations acos and patientcentered medical homes the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us health plans offer preferred provider organization “ppo” plans pointofservice “pos” plans consumer driven health plans “cdhps” high deductible plans and other coverage programs reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans have limited their diagnostic information services network to only a single national provider seeking to obtain improved pricing health plans also are narrowing their provider networks 

we are also sometimes a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by offering to health plans services and programs that leverage our companys expertise and resources including our superior access extensive test menu medical staff data it solutions and wellness and disease management capabilities 

physicians  physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source of our services physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network quality price it solution integration and depth and breadth of test and service offering 

hospitals  hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer esoteric testing to outside service providers which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing services often are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing services in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospitals histology or clinical laboratory including through our professional laboratory services offerings we believe that we are the industrys leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to improve profitability through cost containment or to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform testing their patients need and may compete with nonhospital providers for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves 

hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals affiliated laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus have been frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services in light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical

testing services we believe that our combination of services including fullservice esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation integrated it solutions and strong focus on quality has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals offering a full range of strategic relationships 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading hospitals or idns in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers serve as our principal facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our joint venture relationships 

idns and acos  an idn is a network of providers and facilities working together in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare an aco is a network of providers and facilities that share financial risk in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare acos and idns are increasing in number and becoming more important constituents in delivering healthcare services acos and idns may exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care acos and idns also may function as a payer thus acos or idns may be able to manage the health of a population group within a defined geography and also may be able to influence the cost and quality of healthcare delivery for example through owned entities and through ancillary services acos and idns actively are considering and adopting bundled payment models for services that they are purchasing like diagnostic information services the impact of acos and idns on the provision of healthcare services to date has varied we are actively engaging with acos and idns to demonstrate the value that our services can provide to them acos may be encouraged to consider exclusive arrangements with health care providers that become part of the aco or to limit service providers to the aco since members of the aco share financial risk 

employers  employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individuals employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high employee turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugsofabuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer health and wellness services including wellness testing analytic services and onsite prevention and customized wellness services to help employers employees and others manage healthcare costs and capitalize on trends in personalized health 

patients  patients also are our customers in the current environment patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased financial responsibility for their healthcare we strive to give patients reasons to choose quest diagnostics including a superior patient experience 

other laboratories and other customers  we also provide diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis to federal state and local governmental agencies and to other commercial clinical laboratories 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices in recent years competition from hospitalaffiliated laboratories has increased our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories as well as manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider including

table of contents   

 

we believe that offering the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test offerings a superior customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality unparalleled access and distribution and datapowered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the diagnostic products risk assessment clinical trials and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products industry through unique and differentiated products we compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the worlds leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers including smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale and downstream marketing of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchise organizations which are responsible for upstream marketing the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to ensure aligned delivery for our customers we maintain a separate sales and marketing organization for our employer drugsofabuse testing services 

in diagnostic solutions we maintain separate sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products healthcare information technology solutions risk assessment services and clinical trials services 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test ordering and reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to implement more common laboratory information and billing systems across our operations to standardize our processes we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment

quality assurance  in our diagnostic information services business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting the quest diagnostics quality program includes policies and procedures to document measure and monitor the effectiveness of laboratory operations in providing quality improving quality and meeting the requirements of the agencies that regulate the us clinical laboratory testing industry the quality program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to proactively identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems we track and seek to improve on numerous medical quality and service metrics 

our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we have implemented a specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry we continue to implement initiatives to enhance our quality and standardization using our bestinclass business performance tools in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification for their quality management systems 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our diagnostic information services for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement act clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peerreview evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states and other countries they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the united states in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations 

intellectual property rights   we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business

employees  at december 31 2014 we employed approximately 45000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

the majority of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility in recent years increased patient responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense to the extent that health plans and other programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact our bad debt expense we are taking and plan to continue to take steps to improve our patient collection experience 

the remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers in general due to the nature of our business historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the local medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for diagnostic information services 

table of contents   

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules historically the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and the medicare physician fee schedule established under that program have been subject to change including each year for 2015 each schedule is changing and reimbursement under each schedule will be different in 2015 than 2014 levels the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2014 



penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for penalties on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government reimbursement from traditional medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 17 of our consolidated net revenues during 2014 over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been growth of health insurance providers offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in other jurisdictions we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 

clia and state clinical laboratory licensing   all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of clia compliance makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices 

  

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests 

fraud and abuse   antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory 

table of contents   

some states also have similar laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

fda   the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore may conduct inspections related to testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugsofabuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro  fertilization a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced guidance initiatives that may significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts 

our diagnostic products businesses are subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies under laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products these regulators possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions 

environmental health and safety  we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the us this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the us postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

physicians  many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the enforceability of these covenants may be limited under state law 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

several jurisdictions including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain jurisdictions business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these jurisdictions to oversee the practice of medicine in some jurisdictions anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

privacy and security of health and personal information  we are required to comply with laws and regulations in the united states at the federal and state levels and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business including the european union regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information these privacy and security laws include the federal health insurance portability and accountability act as amended and the regulations thereunder collectively “hipaa” the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information together these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information we maintain policies and practices designed to meet applicable requirements 

drug testing controlled substances  all us laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to 

table of contents   

controlled substances used to perform drugsofabuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform testing described in this paragraph are certified or licensed as required 

compliance  we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement for tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science healthcare technology and healthcare organizations such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam  provisions of federal and state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business consolidated financial condition revenues results of operations profitability reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 



the us healthcare system is evolving and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

the us healthcare system is evolving in part in response to march 2010 us federal legislation enacted to reform healthcare the law provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the law imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories the law established the independent payment advisory board which is responsible annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the law calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the law provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the law also permits the establishment of acos 

significant change is taking place in the healthcare system including as discussed above under the heading the united states clinical testing industry  beginning on page 12 for example acos and patientcentered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care valuebased reimbursement is increasing health care services increasingly are being provided by nontraditional providers eg physician assistants in nontraditional venues eg retail medical clinics urgent care centers and using new technologies eg telemedicine we expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue and that industry change is likely to be extensive 

table of contents   

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position the formation of acos and idns and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers in addition to the impact of informatics also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis in recent years reductions in the medicare physician fee schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services copayments for clinical laboratory testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions 

2014 us federal legislation the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 is impacting the clinical laboratory testing industry key parts of this legislation include provisions that provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a marketbased process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule if this process does not recognize the value that clinical laboratory testing brings to the healthcare system our business can be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents   

third parties including health plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services for example in light of health care reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models we expect continuing efforts by thirdparty payers including in their rules practices and policies to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services acos and idns also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of or reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan some health plans also are reviewing test coding evaluating coverage decisions and considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

it is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their scrutiny and enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business including the application of medical device excise taxes to our business the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new services cause an increase in the cost of our services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing 

failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business 

attacks on our information technology systems or failure in these systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our it systems moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions computer viruses unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems our information technology systems from time to time have experienced minor attacks minor viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems like other major companies but each was mitigated and none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys information technology systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

we have taken precautionary measures to prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our it systems including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems in addition we continue to strengthen precautionary measures to reduce the risk of and to detect future cyber threats however cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business 

we are planning to implement common laboratory information and billing systems which will promote standardized processes we expect that this effort will take several years to complete and may result in temporary disruptions in service

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new solutions technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new solutions technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our services may become outdated when compared with our competition 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new more costeffective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing including some esoteric testing internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers such as the company 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 38 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered our borrowing costs could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

table of contents   

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong we may lose or fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees eg pathologists at our clinical laboratories or research centers 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks the services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2015 we must adequately implement the new coding set in addition physicians may fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests historically delays in billing have resulted in increased costs and decreased collection of payment 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for tests 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing the adoption of these codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this has led and could continue to lead to limited coverage decisions payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment health plans medicare contractors and medicaid programs continue to consider or implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and health care providers continue to address implementation of the new codes 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in the us healthcare system including healthcare utilization and increased patient financial responsibility for services 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the united states trends in the utilization of the us healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as unemployment underemployed workers decisions to delay medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care declining utilization of the us healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services 

in the current environment patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for and often are bearing increased financial responsibility for their healthcare our operations also may be adversely impacted by the recent trend to increased patient responsibility for payment for healthcare services including diagnostic information services

our strategy and strengths 

in 2012 quest diagnostics launched a new vision and strategy our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights we have three aspirational goals a healthier world build a valuable company and create an inspiring workplace our values were unchanged quality integrity accountability innovation and leadership 

our strategy    

in 2012 we introduced a fivepoint business strategy to help us achieve our vision and our goals in 2013 we executed against our fivepoint strategy and as the year concluded revised the priority of the five points in the strategy the discussion below reflects the current priorities 

1 restore growth  in 2013 we launched a multiyear initiative project restore to identify prioritize resource and implement a wide range of activities designed to create consistent profitable growth for example the program leverages centralized analytics and best practice teams to improve sales and marketing effectiveness reduce attrition and bring to local teams lessons learned across the enterprise our goal is to achieve and ultimately exceed market growth rates over the course of the program 

we are pursuing seven tactical approaches to restore growth three of these approaches have a nearterm focus sales and marketing excellence grow esoteric testing through a disease focus and provide professional lab services to hospitals and idns the remaining four growth approaches have a longterm focus succeed internationally create value from information assets lead in companion diagnostics and extend in adjacent markets 

in 2013 we made progress on our goal to be the preferred partner for diagnostic information services through sales and marketing excellence we created one commercial organization in our diagnostic information services business centrally led and focused on local customer needs we are implementing worldclass management discipline around processes tools and measurement we are building a virtuous circle of talent acquisition and retention and have instilled a customerfocused winning culture our expectation is that the combination of these elements will result in physicians hospitals health plans idns and employers being eager to partner with quest diagnostics 

we plan to grow esoteric testing revenues by creating value through scientific and product innovation for major clinical opportunities further we are pursuing opportunities to create value from the integration of lab testing and clinical information we also plan to provide holistic solutions centered on evidencesupported standards of care and to combine routine guideline mandated testing with esoteric solutions in 2013 we put in place clinical franchise organizations to focus on these opportunities working with our science and innovation team the clinical franchise organizations focus on cancer cardiovascular infectious disease and immunology neurology prescription drug monitoring and toxicology sports diagnostics wellness and womens and reproductive health the october 2013 launch of our brcavantage tm  solution only a few months after the decision of the united states supreme court in the myriad  patent case is an example of the power of our new clinical franchises our franchises are designed to enable us to act like a focused boutique service provider while maintaining the advantages of our scale 

in addition we plan to grow by pursuing strategic partnerships with hospitals and idns we believe that continued price and utilization pressure as well as evolving payment models in healthcare will drive demand for our expertise in a range of strategic partnerships including lab management outsourcing outreach acquisition and joint ventures we can partner with hospitals to drive the success of accountable care organizations including by consolidating data and delivering insights delivering test management solutions to improve care and help control cost and by providing patientfocused programs to enable effective management of care our 2013 agreements with umass memorial medical center and dignity health are examples of the kinds of opportunities we see our laboratory professional services team continues to expand its pipeline of hospitals and idns interested in working with us to improve outcomes and reduce costs 

2 drive operational excellence  improving our operations will yield many benefits including enhancing customer satisfaction employee engagement and shareholder value improving our competitiveness and strengthening our foundation for growth to drive operational excellence we are focusing on four strategic imperatives to deliver a superior customer experience to enhance our endtoend customer value chain with enterprise architecture to develop bestinclass business performance tools and to elevate our cost excellence in 2013 we made strong progress driving operational excellence and improving our quality and efficiency we believe that this will enable us to improve our overall customer experience 

our cost excellence program invigorate consists of seven flagship programs with structured plans in each to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain organization excellence information technology 

table of contents   

excellence procurement excellence service excellence lab excellence billing excellence and business process excellence invigorate delivered more than 250 million in realized savings in 2013 we also exited 2013 with runrate savings of more than 500 million compared to 2011 surpassing the original invigorate goal established in 2011 a year earlier than planned this positions the company to exceed our 600 million goal in runrate savings by the end of 2014 compared to 2011 we now anticipate runrate savings approaching 700 million compared to 2011 we also are pursuing opportunities to increase this total to 1 billion beyond 2014 

3 simplify the organization to enable growth and productivity   in 2012 we concluded that our organization was not structured to align well with our objectives previously the organization was too complex and it failed to let the company take advantage of its scale and capabilities in 2013 we revised our senior management team it now is composed of both executives who joined the company prior to our current president and chief executive officer and several executives who joined thereafter we also restructured our organization to eliminate silos in our core business and provide for leadership in defined geographies these changes included the elimination of three management layers and over 500 management positions our new organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities to align upstream and downstream units in our business for seamless execution and to leverage our companywide infrastructure to gain more capability value and efficiency in 2013 we also introduced new behaviors to make us more agile transparent customerfocused collaborative and performance oriented we continue to simplify the organization to better focus on our customers speed decisionmaking and to empower employees 

the company is made up of two businesses diagnostic information services and diagnostic solutions our diagnostic information services business comprised of two parts develops and delivers diagnostic testing information and services to patients physicians health plans hospitals idns employers and others the value creation side of the business organized by clinical franchise focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace including new test development and upstream marketing the value delivery side includes sales and downstream marketing routine and esoteric laboratory operations field operations logistics and client services diagnostic solutions includes our other businesses including central laboratory testing for pharmaceutical and medical device clinical trials life insurer services diagnostic products and healthcare information technology 

4 refocus on diagnostic information services we are refocusing on diagnostic information services we retained pathology services and our international assets and are evaluating options with respect to the celera corporation celera drug assets and the celera products businesses as 2012 concluded we sold our oraldna salivary diagnostics business in 2013 we sold our hemocue and enterix diagnostic products businesses and the ibrutinib royalty rights 

5 deliver disciplined capital deployment and strategically aligned accretive acquisitions  we are focused on increasing shareholder returns and returns on invested capital “roic” through a framework that encompasses improving operating performance and disciplined capital deployment 

our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends share repurchases and investment in our business and is intended to improve roic the framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating our target debtebitda ratio is in the range of 2  2¼ times we expect to return to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases a majority of our free cash flow consistent with that expectation in january 2014 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10 from 030 per common share to 033 per common share this represents our third increase in the dividend since 2011 we believe that the dividend can grow over time we also believe that opportunities may arise to return incremental capital to shareholders from free cash flow as a result of portfolio actions in 2013 we returned more than 1 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock including approximately 800 million of proceeds from our portfolio actions including the sales of hemocue enterix oraldna and the ibrutinib royalty rights 

we will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner we believe that we have established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities we expect to generate 1 to 2 percent revenue growth per year through valuecreating strategicallyaligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria we screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations including value creation roic and impact on our earnings in 2013 we closed acquisitions of the laboratory assets of umass memorial medical center dignity health advanced toxicology network and converge diagnostics services 

our additional nearterm investments in growth are likely to focus on investments in science and innovation in the form of licensing collaborations and internal development to grow esoteric testing and tools to support commercial excellence we also expect to make investments to improve operational excellence including for example systems standardization and

automation footprint optimization and project invigorate in addition we expect to make additional investments to restore growth including for example project restore 

our strengths 

we offer high value diagnostic information services and diagnostic solutions including those grounded in pathology and genebased and esoteric testing that are attractive to patients physicians hospitals health plans idns employers and others we believe that customers and payers prefer providers that offer a comprehensive and innovative range of tests and services and the most convenient access to those services and that by offering such services we strengthen our market offering market position and reputation 

our assets and capabilities  we are the world leader in the diagnostic information services business we are the leading provider in the united states of routine and genebased and esoteric testing services including anatomic pathology serving approximately onethird of the adult population of the united states each year we have the leading test menu in the industry we offer national access and have the most extensive network in the united states our nationwide specimen collection network includes over 2200 of our own patient service centers and in addition approximately 3200 phlebotomists in physician offices we also operate many additional locations where approximately 5500 paramedical examiners coordinate the provision of paramedical examinations related to life insurance applications we have a medical and scientific staff available for consultation including over 725 mds and phds primarily located in the united states many of whom are recognized leaders in their field and genetic counselors we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the united states we have strong logistics capabilities including approximately 3000 courier vehicles and 20 aircraft that collectively make tens of thousands of stops daily 

innovation   we are a leading innovator in diagnostic information services with outstanding medical and technical expertise we collaborate with multiple organizations including leading academic centers and others and maintain relationships with advisors and consultants that are leaders in key fields such as cardiology oncology neurology and infectious disease our medical and scientific experts publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing including in connection with our research and development efforts in 2013 they authored approximately 150 publications including about 100 articles in peerreviewed journals that provided insights into diagnostic testing introduced novel diagnostic approaches benefiting patients or provided the latest thinking in laboratory testing and disease diagnosis we also publish quest diagnostics health trends tm  reports identifying trends in disease and wellness recent reports focused on cardiovascular health and prescription drug monitoring

diagnostic information services 

background  clinical testing   

clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical testing to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services 

  clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include blood chemistries urinalysis allergy tests and complete blood cell counts 

esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests typically that are not routine esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology these tests may require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory which specializes in performing these complex tests commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests genetic tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations genebased and esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen 

anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues such as biopsies and other samples such as human cells anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients

innovation   

we are a leading innovator in diagnostic information services our capabilities include early discovery technology development and clinical validation of diagnostic tests we develop tests at our laboratories such as quest diagnostics nichols institute and athena diagnostics where appropriate we collaborate with partners that can help us to achieve our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights our partnership with the new york giants professional football team devoted to finding new ways to use diagnostic information services to improve the health and performance of athletes of all ages and abilities is a good example of this 

we collaborate with leading academic centers and maintain relationships with advisers and consultants who are leaders in key fields of science and medicine for example we collaborate with the university of california san francisco the nations leading university focused exclusively on health to accelerate the translation of biomedical research into advanced diagnostics in the field of precision medicine this collaboration has the overarching aim of enabling holistic and integrated diagnostic solutions that close gaps in care or enable new clinical value with initial focus areas including autism oncology neurology and womens health in addition we collaborate with other key groups and organizations to foster important advances in health care our collaboration with the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc to improve public health analysis of hepatitis c screening diagnosis and treatment based on analysis of our national hepatitis c virus hcv diagnostic information and our participation in studies sponsored by the national institutes of health eg nih national children study are good examples of this 

our medical and scientific experts publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing including in connection with our research and development efforts in 2013 they authored approximately 150 publications including about 100 articles in peerreviewed journals that provided insights into diagnostic testing introduced novel diagnostic approaches benefiting patients or provided the latest thinking in laboratory testing and disease diagnosis they also help to shape the latest thinking as the authors of textbooks or chapters therein used by academic institutions to train healthcare providers our experts also participate on scientific committees determining guidelines for diagnostic usage in a number of fields such as hiv hcv and testosterone testing 

we successfully transfer technical innovations to the market through our relationships with technology developers including the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms our inhouse expertise and our collaborations including with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies for example in 2013 we introduced access to a new noninvasive cellfree fetal dna screening test developed by natera a leading innovator in prenatal genetic testing we search for new opportunities and continue to build a robust pipeline of new solutions through our strengths in assay development and the commercialization of test services we believe that we are the partner of choice for developers of new technologies and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we seek technologies that help doctors care for their patients through better predisposition screening monitoring diagnosis prognosis and treatment choices we seek to develop tests that help to determine a patients genotype or gene

healthcare information technology   

we provide interoperable technologies that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter share and access clinical information without costly information technology implementation or significant workflow disruption 

  our care360 ® ehr product allows physicians to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter automates and streamlines the clinicians workflow and allows for rapid deployment and implementation with minimal workflow disruption the solution allows doctors to electronically create manage and distribute patient encounter notes including vital signs and progress notes it captures lab and radiology results provides clinical decision support tools and allows doctors to send secure messages and clinical information to other practitioners and secure webbased laboratory results to their patients personal health records 

chartmaxx ®  is our electronic document management system for hospitals clients have contracted for its use at over 185 sites nationwide 

noncommercial development state drug assets 

as a result of its 2011 acquisition of celera the company also has an interest in noncommercial development state drug assets the company is evaluating options with respect to these interests 

we have an agreement with merck  co inc merck under which merck has a license to our intellectual property for the development of among other things small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin k this agreement was entered into by a predecessor of celera that celera acquired in november 2001 under the agreement we are entitled to receive future milestone payments based on development progress for each potential product under the agreement we are also entitled to receive single digit royalty payments from the sale of drugs if any resulting from the program this drug development program entered phase iii clinical trials in september 2007 and merck has disclosed its intent to file a new drug application in 2014 we do not control the development activities conducted by merck merck may not successfully develop or commercialize any compounds covered by the agreement and may not obtain needed regulatory approvals and we may not receive any further payments under this agreement 

the company may be entitled to milestone payments associated with the small molecule drug discovery and development programs sold by celera to pharmacyclics inc in 2006 these programs are for the treatment of cancer and other diseases including programs that target histone deactylase factor viia and b cell tyrosine kinases involved in immune function in addition we will be entitled to royalty payments in the single digits based on annual sales of any drugs other than ibrutinib commercialized from the three programs if any we have not received any royalty payments related to these programs in 2013 we sold the rights to royalties in respect of ibrutinib a drug candidate that is an inhibitor of the enzyme brutons tyrosine kinase for 485 million in late 2013 the fda announced approval of ibrutinib to treat patients with mantle cell lymphoma 

we have no direct control over the amount or timing of resources devoted to any of these programs the programs may never meet the specified milestones or the programs may be terminated and therefore may never generate milestone payments also even if some milestones are met there is no assurance that these programs will result in any product sales that would generate royalty payments to us 

our small molecule program agreements will remain in effect for as long as any royalties are payable under the respective agreements the obligation to pay royalties generally coincides with the life of the underlying patents each of the third parties with which we have agreements are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a therapeutic product and to pay us amounts due under the terms of the agreements including milestone andor royalty payments promptly after the amounts become payable these agreements generally are terminable upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by either party in addition merck may terminate its agreement with us for any reason upon advance written notice but would lose its license from us and would not be able to commercialize any product under the license

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments one segment which we believe makes up approximately 40 of the total industry includes testing done within hospitals including both inpatient and outpatient testing the second segment which we believe makes up approximately 60 of the total industry includes testing done outside of hospitals including hospital outreach testing and testing done in commercial clinical laboratories physicianoffice laboratories and other locations within the second segment we believe that hospital outreach has been increasing share in the last few years we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the total industry commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories and other locations account for the balance 

key trends  there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because diagnostic information service is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

demographics  as the population continues to grow and age the burden of chronic diseases and unmet diagnostic needs may increase the demand for diagnostic information service 

prevention and wellness  we believe that the value of detection prevention wellness and personalized care now is well recognized consumers employers health plans and government agencies increasingly focus on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive care that helps avoid disease physicians increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results there is increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient costsharing for preventive services and additional provisions that we believe will increase the number of patients that have health insurance including medicaid and thus better access to diagnostic testing 

science and technology advances  medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing advances in genomics and proteomics are expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for personalized or tailored medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is increasing focus on interconnectivity and electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

customers and payers  our customers and payers including physicians health insurance plans idns employers pharmaceutical companies and others have been consolidating and diversifying for example an increased number of hospital systems are considering establishing or have established health insurance plans and health insurance plans increasingly are considering providing or are providing healthcare services consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power enhancing purchasing sophistication and encouraging internalization of clinical testing physicians increasingly are employed by hospital systems or large group practices integrated with healthcare systems instead of organizing physicianowned practices which is changing the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed by a hospital or a nonhospital patientcentered medical homes are increasingly being established to deliver patient care in addition federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of accountable care organizations and requires implementation of health insurance exchanges which may result in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the united states 

competition  the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position new industry entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations 

reimbursement pressure  there is a strong focus in the united states on controlling the overall cost of healthcare healthcare market participants including governments are focusing on controlling costs including potentially by changing reimbursement for healthcare services including but not limited to a shift from fee for service to capitation revising test 

table of contents   

coding changing medical coverage policies eg healthcare benefits design preauthorization of lab testing requiring copays introducing lab spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as accountable care organizations and patientcentered medical homes while pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our company it creates an opportunity for increased utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare we believe that it also creates greater opportunities for lowcost providers like our company as compared to other providers 

healthcare utilization  in the past few years growth in healthcare utilization in the united states has slowed there may be many factors contributing to this result including sluggish employment growth underemployment in the work force patients delaying medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care 

legislative regulatory and policy environment  government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing healthcare payment reform is a top issue the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests ldts and analyte specific reagents federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to potential and impending changes for example states may opt out of medicaid expansion and employers may discontinue offering group health insurance to their employees shifting more people to exchange products 

globalization  there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems outside the united states additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally also may create opportunities 

customers and payers    we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers including physicians hospitals idns patients and employers in many cases the customer that orders the services is not responsible to pay for them depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be the patient or a third party in some cases patients may bear responsibility for a portion of the payment examples of potential thirdparty payers include health insurance plans selfinsured employer benefit funds accountable care organizations patientcentered medical homes the traditional medicare or medicaid program physicians or others eg a hospital another laboratory or an employer in light of health care reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models 

health plans  health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for diagnostic information services performed reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled less than 20 and no one health plan accounted for 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2013 

health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from diagnostic information services the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain locations health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” or other alternative delivery systems eg physician hospital organizations accountable care organizations and patient centered medical homes the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us health plans offer preferred provider organization “ppo” plans pointofservice “pos” plans consumer driven health plans “cdhps” high deductible plans and other coverage programs reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis to the extent that plans and programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans have limited their diagnostics information services network to only a single national provider seeking to obtain improved pricing health plans also are narrowing their provider networks 

we also sometimes are a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of 

table of contents   

its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by offering to health plans services and programs that leverage our companys expertise and resources including our superior access extensive test menu medical staff data and wellness and disease management capabilities 

physicians  physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source of our services physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network quality price and depth and breadth of test and service offering 

hospitals  hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside service providers which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing services often are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing services in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospitals histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industrys leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform testing their patients need and may compete with nonhospital providers for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves 

hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals affiliated laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus have been frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services in light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical testing services we believe that our combination of services including fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation connectivity solutions strong focus on quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals offering a full range of strategic relationships 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading idns in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers serve as our principal facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our joint venture relationships 

idns  an idn is a network of providers and facilities working together in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare with the passage of 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation idns are increasing in number and becoming more important constituents in delivering healthcare services idns may exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care idns also may function as a payer thus idns may be able to manage the health of a population group within a defined geography and also may be able to influence the cost and quality of healthcare delivery for example through owned entities and through ancillary services idns actively are considering bundled payment models for services that they are purchasing like diagnostic information services the impact of idns on the provision of healthcare services to date has varied we are actively engaging with idns to demonstrate the value that our services can provide to them 

employers  employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individuals employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high employee turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugsofabuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer employers our blueprint for wellness ®  program providing wellness screening and analytic services to help employers and their employees manage healthcare costs and capitalize on trends in personalized health

other laboratories and other customers  we also provide diagnostic information services to federal state and local governmental agencies and to other commercial clinical laboratories these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices in recent years competition from hospitalaffiliated laboratories has increased our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider including 

 

we believe that offering the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test and information technology offerings a superior customer experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality and unparalleled access and distribution provides us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers including members of large health plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as pricing in addition market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

the diagnostic products life insurance risk assessment services clinical trials and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products industry through unique and differentiated products we compete in the life insurance risk assessment services business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of integrated services of the highest quality than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the worlds leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale and downstream marketing of most of our services it coordinates closely with our clinical franchise organizations which are responsible for upstream marketing the commercial organization is centrally led and is organized regionally in conjunction with our operations organization to ensure aligned delivery for our customers the commercial organization also is organized to support our clinical franchise organizations we maintain a separate sales and marketing organization for our employer drugsofabuse testing business 

in diagnostic solutions we maintain sales forces devoted to each of our businesses we have sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products and our healthcare information technology solutions we also have dedicated sales teams that focus on selling risk assessment services in the life insurance industry and clinical trials services 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to implement more common laboratory information and billing systems across our operations to standardize our processes we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance  in our diagnostic information services business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we have implemented a specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry we continue to implement initiatives to enhance our quality and standardization using our bestinclass business performance tools in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification for their quality management systems 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our diagnostic information services for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement act clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states and other countries they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the united states in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in 

table of contents   

accordance with iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations 

intellectual property rights  we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

  

employees  at december 31 2013 we employed approximately 41000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility increased patient responsibility and deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact our bad debt expense in general due to the nature of our business we perform the requested testing and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and can be expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the local medicare carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for diagnostic information services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for 2014 is decreased by 75 from 2013 levels in addition reimbursement under the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule continues to be reduced by 2 as a result of federal government sequestration cms implemented changes in the medicare physician fee schedule effective january 1 2014 that are expected to reduce reimbursement for tissue biopsy immunohistochemistry and other services in december 2013 congress delayed by three months a potential decrease of approximately 24 in the medicare physician fee schedule that otherwise would have become effective on january 1 2014 the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2013 



penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for penalties on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government reimbursement from traditional medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 18 of our consolidated net revenues during 2013 over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been growth of health insurance providers offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in other jurisdictions we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 

table of contents   

clia and state clinical laboratory licensing   all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of clia compliance makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices 

  

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests 

fraud and abuse  federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory some states also have similar laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

fda   the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore may conduct inspections related to testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugsofabuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro  fertilization a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts analyte specific reagents and products labeled research use only or investigate use only used in laboratories these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services cause an increase in the cost of our products or services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing the approach also may result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining needed supplies or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain needed supplies these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our diagnostic products businesses are subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro  diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products prior to commercially marketing or selling most diagnostic products in the united states we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda similarly we may need to obtain a license or certification such as a ce mark obtainable where the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device in order to sell diagnostic products outside of the united states compliance with the ivdd allows us to market in europe once we obtain a ce mark following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic inspections and reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions 

environmental health and safety  we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the us this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the us postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to 

table of contents   

dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

physicians  many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

several states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

privacy and security of health and personal information  we are required to comply with laws and regulations in the united states at the federal and state levels and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business including the european union india and mexico regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information these privacy and security laws include the federal health insurance portability and accountability act as amended and the regulations thereunder collectively “hipaa” the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information together these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects provide for penalties for noncompliance and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information we maintain policies and practices designed to meet applicable requirements 

drug testing controlled substances  all us laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugsofabuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform such testing or that utilize controlled substances are so certified or so licensed respectively 

compliance  we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement of tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam  provisions of federal and state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

table of contents   

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices which we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 



us healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare the legislation provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with other providers including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position our failure to provide a broad test menu or services or pricing superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions competitors may compete using advanced technology including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and profitability could be damaged

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services copayments for clinical laboratory testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions if any of these initiatives were implemented it could materially affect us 

in 2014 cms will begin a fiveyear review of 1250 codes on the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule to adjust payment beginning in january 2015 to reflect technological changes that have occurred since the clinical laboratory fee schedule was implemented 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials medicare contractors and medicaid programs continue to implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

third parties including health plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental thirdparty payers including health plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services for example in light of health care reform there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models including bundled payment models 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing some health plans also are considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

table of contents   

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials commercial health plans continue to implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a health plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

government payers and health insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

our new strategic plan may be difficult to implement and may not be successful and in either case it could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

in november 2012 we announced a new strategic plan for our company the success of our new strategy is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing our new strategies and is dependent upon the skills experience and efforts of our management and other employees and our success with third parties restructuring activities involve risks significant costs and potential liabilities among the risks are the following disruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management customer attrition difficulty recruiting hiring motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel increased stock price volatility and changes to our stock price that may be unrelated to our current results of operations and executing the strategy in a timely or efficient manner there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives or that implementation of changes will result in benefits or cost savings at the levels that we anticipate or at all 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from thirdparty claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam  claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their scrutiny and enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse in addition the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

table of contents   

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as ldts the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts analyte specific reagents and products labeled research use only or investigate use only used in laboratories these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services cause an increase in the cost of our products or services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing the approach also may result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining needed supplies or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain needed supplies these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information in addition to the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

attacks on our information technology systems or failure in these systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities 

it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions computer viruses unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems our information technology systems from time to time have experienced minor attacks minor viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems like other major companies but each was mitigated and none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys information technology systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

we are planning to implement common laboratory information and billing systems which will promote standardized processes we expect that this effort will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the 

table of contents   

implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

  

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of common laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for testing in a timely manner 

if we experience systems problems or if we experience unauthorized disclosure of confidential information it could adversely affect our reputation result in a loss of customers and revenues and cause us to suffer financial damage including significant costs to alleviate or eliminate the problem 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our services may become outdated when compared with our competition and our revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions including technology that enables more convenient or costeffective testing competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our revenues 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site thus allowing them to bill for services previously referred to outside pathology service providers such as the company these customers include specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists if our customers continue to internalize testing that we currently perform the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our revenues may be materially adversely impacted

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 33 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and secured receivables facility could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories or research centers our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists particularly those with subspecialties with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

if we do not successfully navigate these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2014 if we do not adequately implement the new coding set our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials 

commercial health plans medicare contractors and medicaid programs continue to implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic testing we perform our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

table of contents   

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liabilities with respect to some of these claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in utilization of the us healthcare system 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the united states trends in the utilization of the us healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as unemployment underemployed workers decisions to delay medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care declining utilization of the us healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the failure to successfully commercialize our development state drug assets may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a result of our 2011 acquisition of celera we have an interest in noncommercial development state drug assets including through a license agreement with merck  co inc and small molecule drug discovery and development programs sold by celera to pharmacyclics inc in 2006 we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on development progress for each potential product and royalty payments from the sale of products if any resulting from these programs however we have no direct control over the amount or timing of resources devoted to developing or commercializing potential products developing and commercializing new products includes inherent risks and uncertainties new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of the patents or intellectual property of others as a result we cannot state with certainty when or whether any products under development will be launched or whether any products will be commercially successful in addition even if some milestones are met there is no assurance that any programs will result in any product sales that would generate royalty payments to us 

  

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement which expires in april 2014 we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends share repurchases and investment in our business and is intended to improve roic the framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating in 2012 the company used the majority of its free cash flow to reduce its outstanding debt and achieve a debtebitda ratio in the range of 2  2¼ times having achieved our targeted leverage ratio we expect to return to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases a majority of our free cash flow consistent with that expectation we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 76 from 017 per common share to 030 per common share in january 2013 this represents a threefold increase in the dividend since 2011 we believe that the dividend can grow over time we also believe that opportunities may arise to return incremental capital to shareholders from free cash flow as a result of portfolio actions 

we will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner we believe that we have established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities and that it is unlikely that we will complete any large strategic acquisitions in the near term our nearterm investments in growth are likely to focus on valuecreating foldin acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria investments in science and innovation in the form of licensing collaborations and internal development to grow esoteric testing and tools to support commercial excellence we will screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations including value creation roic and impact on our earnings we also expect to make investments to improve operational excellence including for example systems standardization and automation footprint optimization and project invigorate

diagnostic information services 

background  clinical testing   

clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical testing to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services 

  clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include blood chemistries urinalysis allergy tests and complete blood cell counts 

esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests typically that are not routine esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology these tests may require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory which specializes in performing these complex tests commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests genetic tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations genebased and esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen 

anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues such as biopsies and other samples such as human cells anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients

noncommercial development state drug assets 

as a result of its 2011 acquisition of celera the company also has an interest in noncommercial development state drug assets the company is evaluating options with respect to these assets 

we have an agreement with merck  co inc merck under which merck has a license to our intellectual property for the development of small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin k for the treatment of osteoporosis this agreement was entered into by a predecessor of celera that celera acquired in november 2001 under the agreement we are entitled to receive future milestone payments based on development progress for each potential product under the agreement we are also entitled to receive single digit royalty payments from the sale of drugs if any resulting from the program this drug development program entered phase iii clinical trials in september 2007 and merck has disclosed its intent to file a new drug application in 2014 we do not control the development activities conducted by merck merck may not successfully develop or commercialize any compounds covered by the agreement may not obtain needed regulatory approvals and we may not receive any further payments under this collaboration agreement 

table of contents   

the company may be entitled to milestone payments associated with the small molecule drug discovery and development programs sold by celera to pharmacyclics inc in 2006 these programs are for the treatment of cancer and other diseases including programs that target histone deactylase or hdac selective hdac enzymes factor viia and b cell tyrosine kinases involved in immune function in addition we will be entitled to royalty payments in the single digits based on annual sales of any drugs commercialized from the three programs if any we have not received any royalty payments related to these programs 

we have no direct control over the amount or timing of resources devoted to any of these programs the programs may never meet the specified milestones or the programs may be terminated and therefore may never generate milestone payments also even if some milestones are met there is no assurance that these programs will result in any product sales that would generate royalty payments to us 

our small molecule program agreements will remain in effect for as long as any royalties are payable under the respective agreements the obligation to pay royalties generally coincides with the life of the underlying patents each of the third parties with which we have agreements are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a therapeutic product and to pay us amounts due under the terms of the agreements including milestone andor royalty payments promptly after the amounts become payable these agreements generally are terminable upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by either party in addition merck may terminate its collaboration agreement with us for any reason upon advance written notice but would lose its license from us and would not be able to commercialize any product under the license 

the united states clinical testing industry 

 the us clinical testing industry consists of two segments one segment which we believe makes up approximately 40 of the total industry includes testing done within hospitals including both inpatient and outpatient testing the second segment which we believe makes up approximately 60 of the total industry includes testing done outside of hospitals including hospital outreach testing and testing done in commercial clinical laboratories physicianoffice laboratories and other locations within the second segment we believe that hospital outreach has been increasing share in the last few years we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the total industry commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories and other locations account for the balance 

key trends  there are a number of key trends that are having and that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because diagnostic information service is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

demographics  the growing and aging population the burden of chronic diseases and unmet diagnostic needs may increase the demand for diagnostic information service 

prevention and wellness  we believe that the value of detection prevention wellness and personalized care now is well recognized consumers employers health plans and government agencies increasingly are focusing on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive care that helps avoid disease physicians increasingly are relying on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results there is an increased focus on a diseaseoriented approach to diagnostics treatment and management physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient costsharing for preventive services and additional provisions that we believe will increase the number of patients that have health insurance including medicaid and thus better access to diagnostic testing 

science and technology advances  medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing advances in genomics and proteomics is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for personalized or tailored medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is an increasing focus on interconnectivity and electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

table of contents   

customers and payers  our customers and payers including physicians health insurance plans idns employers pharmaceutical companies and others have been consolidating and diversifying for example an increased number of hospital systems are considering establishing or have established health insurance plans and health insurance plans increasingly are considering providing or are providing healthcare services consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power enhancing purchasing sophistication and encouraging internalization of clinical testing physicians increasingly are employed by hospital systems or large group practices integrated with healthcare systems instead of organizing physicianowned practices which is changing the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed by a hospital or a nonhospital patientcentered medical homes are increasingly being established to deliver patient care in addition federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of accountable care organizations and requires implementation of health insurance exchanges which may result in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the united states 

competition  the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position new industry entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations 

reimbursement pressure  there is a strong focus in the united states on controlling the overall cost of healthcare healthcare market participants including governments are focusing on controlling costs including potentially by changing reimbursement for healthcare services including but not limited to a shift from fee for service to capitation revising test coding changing medical coverage policies eg healthcare benefits design preauthorization of lab testing requiring copays introducing lab spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as accountable care organizations and patientcentered medical homes while pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our company it creates an opportunity for increased utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare we believe that it also creates opportunities for lowcost providers like our company as compared to other providers 

healthcare utilization  in the past few years growth in healthcare utilization in the united states has slowed there may be many factors contributing to this result including sluggish employment growth benefit plans imposing higher levels of patient responsibility underemployment in the work force and patients delaying medical care 

legislative regulatory and policy environment  government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing healthcare payment reform is a top issue the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts and analyte specific reagents if finalized these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to potential and impending changes for example states may opt out of medicaid expansion and employers may discontinue offering group health insurance to their employees shifting more people to exchange products 

globalization  there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems in these countries additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally also may create opportunities 

customers and payers    we provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers who order such services including physicians hospitals idns and employers in many cases the customer that orders the services is not responsible for the payments for services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients such as a health insurance plan selfinsured employer benefit fund an accountable care organization a patientcentered medical home or the traditional medicare or medicaid program 2 the patient or 3 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who send the testing to us 

health plans  health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for diagnostic information services performed reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled less than 20  and no one health plan accounted for 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2012 

health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from diagnostic information services the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain locations such as california 

table of contents   

health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” or other alternative delivery systems eg physician hospital organizations the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us health plans continue to offer preferred provider organization “ppo” plans pointofservice “pos” plans consumer driven health plans “cdhps” and limited benefit coverage programs reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis to the extent that plans and programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans have limited their diagnostics information services network to only a single national provider seeking to obtain improved pricing health plans also are narrowing their networks 

we also sometimes are a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by offering to health plans services and programs that leverage our companys expertise and resources including our superior access extensive test menu medical staff and data and in such areas as wellness and disease management 

physicians  physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source of our services physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network quality price and depth and breadth of test and service offering 

hospitals  hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside service providers which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing services often are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing services in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospitals histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industrys leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform testing their patients need and may compete with nonhospital providers for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves 

most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals affiliated laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus have been frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services in light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs it is not clear that hospitals will be able to maintain higher reimbursement rates in the future we believe that our combination of services including fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation innovative connectivity products pointofcare testing products strong focus on quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals offering a full range of strategic relationships 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading idns in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and

other local healthcare providers serve as our principal facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our joint venture relationships 

idns  an idn is a network of providers and facilities working together in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare with the passage of 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation idns are increasing in number and becoming more important constituents in delivering healthcare services idns may exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care idns also may function as a payer thus idns may be able to manage the health of a population group within a defined geography and also may be able to influence the cost and quality of healthcare delivery for example though owned entities and through ancillary services the impact of idns on the provision of healthcare services to date has varied we are actively engaging with idns to demonstrate the value that our services can provide to them 

employers  employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individuals employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high employee turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugs of abuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer employers our blueprint for wellness ®  program providing wellness screening and analytic services to help employers and their employees manage increasing healthcare costs and capitalize on trends in personalized health 

other laboratories and other customers  we also provide diagnostic information services to federal state and local governmental agencies and to other commercial clinical laboratories these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

general 

competition  while there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories in recent years competition from hospitalaffiliated laboratories has increased our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider including 

 

we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas we also believe that offering the most attractive service offering in the industry including the most comprehensive test menu innovative test and information technology offerings a superior patient experience a staff including medical and scientific experts strong quality and unparalleled access and distribution provides us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers including members of large health plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing 

table of contents   

to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors in addition recent market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers in addition increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories enhancing the competitive position of hospitalaffiliated laboratories 

the diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients could reduce the demand for our diagnostic information services and negatively impact our revenues 

the diagnostic products life insurance risk assessment services clinical trials and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products industry by attempting to find and exploit unique and differentiated products including products that take advantage of our healthcare information technology solutions we compete in the life insurance risk assessment services business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of highest quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the worlds leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions we compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare institutions patients and physician practices particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing   our diagnostic information services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sales and downstream marketing of most of our services the vision of the commercial organization which has a revitalized customerfocused culture is to be the preferred partner for diagnostic information services to key segments through sales and marketing excellence the organization is centrally led and is organized regionally to in conjunction with our operations organization ensure alignment on delivering for our customers the commercial organization also is organized to support each of our clinical franchises we maintain a separate sales and marketing organization for our employer drugsofabuse testing business 

in diagnostic solutions we maintain sales forces devoted to each of our businesses we have sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products and our healthcare information technology solutions we also have dedicated sales teams that focus on selling risk assessment services in the life insurance industry and clinical trials services 

  

information technology  we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we believe that our healthcare information technology systems help differentiate us favorably we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company patients and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have implemented some common systems and are planning to implement more common laboratory information and billing systems across our operations to standardize our processes we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance  in our diagnostic information services business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we have implemented an enhanced specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens we continue to implement our quality and standardization initiatives building on our six sigma foundation to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry in addition some of our 

table of contents   

laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification for their quality management systems 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our diagnostic information services for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states and other countries they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the united states in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations 

intellectual property rights  we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

  

employees  at december 31 2012 we employed approximately 41000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

billing  we generally bill for diagnostic information services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

  

 

billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals idns and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors 

table of contents   

that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

  

we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact our bad debt expense in general due to the potentially critical nature of our services we perform the requested testing and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements  government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and can be expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years historically many different local carriers administered medicare part b which covers services provided by commercial clinical laboratories they often had inconsistent policies increasing the complexity of the billing process for clinical testing services providers they are being replaced with contractors who will administer both part b and medicare part a benefits for beneficiaries in larger regional areas it is expected that the revised system will reduce the administrative complexity of billing for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

with regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carriers fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule but generally does require copayments for anatomic pathology services certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for diagnostic information services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for 2013 is decreased by 295 excluding sequestration from 2012 levels in december 2012 congress delayed by one year a potential decrease of approximately 26 in the physician fee schedule that otherwise would have become effective january 1 2013 but implemented relative value unit changes significantly impacting physician fee schedule reimbursement for tissue biopsies that are expected to reduce reimbursement for tissue biopsy services also an additional 2 reduction in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for 2013 associated with sequestration was delayed until april 1 2013 the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2012

penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for penalties on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these plans in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for traditional medicaid programs 

regulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in other jurisdictions we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses 

clia and state clinical laboratory licensing   all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

  

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests 

fraud and abuse  federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory some states also have similar laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

table of contents   

fda   the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore may conduct inspections related to testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugs of abuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro  fertilization a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as laboratorydeveloped tests “ldts” the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts and analyte specific reagents if finalized these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services cause an increase in the cost of our products or services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing the approach also may result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining needed supplies or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain needed supplies these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our diagnostic product business is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro  diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products prior to commercially marketing or selling most diagnostic products in the united states we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda similarly we may need to obtain a license or certification such as a ce mark in order to sell diagnostic products outside of the united states compliance with the ivdd allows us to market in europe once we obtain a ce mark obtainable where the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic inspections and reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions 

environmental health and safety  we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the us this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

physicians  many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

several states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

privacy and security of health and personal information  we are required to comply with laws and regulations in the united states at the federal and state levels and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business 

table of contents   

including the european union india and mexico regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information these privacy and security laws include the federal health insurance portability and accountability act as amended and the regulations thereunder collectively “hipaa” the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information together these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects provide for penalties for noncompliance and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of unsecured personal or a patients protected health information the regulations were revised in early 2013 we have maintained policies and practices designed to meet applicable requirements and plan to update them to address the new regulations 

drug testing controlled substances  all us laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform such testing or that utilize controlled substances are so certified or so licensed respectively 

compliance  we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement of tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam  provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on theories as to our current practices that we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs reimbursement from traditional medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 19 of our net revenues during 2012 we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

us healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare the legislation provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories beginning in 2013 the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

the clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospitals laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position our failure to provide a broad test menu or services superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and profitability could be damaged 

our new strategic plan may be difficult to implement and may not be successful and in either case it could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

in november 2012 we announced a new strategic plan for our company including refocusing on diagnostic information services driving operational excellence restoring growth simplifying our organization to enable growth and productivity and delivering disciplined capital management and strategically aligned accretive acquisitions the success of our new strategy is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing our new strategies and is dependent upon the skills experience and efforts of our management and other employees and our success with third parties restructuring activities involve risks significant costs and potential liabilities among the risks are the following disruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management customer attrition difficulty recruiting hiring motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel increased stock price volatility and changes to our stock price that may be unrelated to our current results of operations and executing the strategy in a timely or efficient manner there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives or that implementation of changes will result in benefits or cost savings at the levels that we anticipate or at all

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

government payers and health insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including diagnostic information services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

continued weakness in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the economies of the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business continue to experience significant weakness which in the case of the us has resulted in significant unemployment and reduced economic activity continued weakness or a further decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products thus reducing our revenue these conditions also could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fdas approach to regulation 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as laboratorydeveloped tests “ldts” the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories the fda has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business including by increasing regulation of ldts and analyte specific reagents if finalized these initiatives could have a significant impact on our business the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company the approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services cause an increase in the cost of our products or services delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing the approach also may result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining needed supplies or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain needed supplies these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services 

  

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for diagnostic information services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for traditional medicaid programs recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us congress periodically considers costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services copayments for clinical laboratory testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions if any of these initiatives were implemented it could materially affect us 

table of contents   

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing the 2012 cpt manual adopted approximately 100 of such codes the 2013 cpt manual adopted additional codes and there are now cpt codes covering over 300 molecular tests while cms deferred adoption of the 2012 molecular codes until january 2013 a handful of commercial health plans implemented them in 2012 the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials further in late 2012 cms delegated the payment level determination for the new codes to the medicare contractors currently some contractors are beginning to issue payment and coverage decisions but the payment levels and the methodology for determining how payment will be determined by cms and commercial health plans still remains largely unresolved if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic testing we perform our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

health plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of health services including clinical testing services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including health plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these health plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some health plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing some health plans also are considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among health plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a health plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others

table of contents   

 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 

these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal and state enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 

table of contents   

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for diagnostic information services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

attacks on our information technology systems or failure in these systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities 

information technology “it” systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions computer viruses unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems our information technology systems from time to time have experienced minor attacks minor viruses attempted intrusions or similar problems like other major companies but each was mitigated and none materially disrupted interrupted damaged or shutdown the companys information technology systems materially disrupted the companys performance of its business or to the companys knowledge resulted in material unauthorized access to data 

we are planning to implement common laboratory information and billing systems which will promote standardized processes we expect that this effort will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

  

table of contents   

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of common laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for testing in a timely manner 

if we experience systems problems or if we experience unauthorized disclosure of confidential information it could adversely affect our reputation result in a loss of customers and revenues and cause us to suffer financial damage including significant costs to alleviate or eliminate the problem 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests or services we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our services may become outdated when compared with our competition and our revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 

the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing although physicians operating inoffice laboratories incur additional costs for clia compliance manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits seek to increase their sales by marketing to physicians pointofcare test equipment and test kits that require minimal regulatory oversight further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our revenues 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site thus allowing them to bill for services previously referred to outside pathology service providers such as the company these customers include specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists if our customers continue to internalize testing that we currently perform the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our revenues may be materially adversely impacted

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 34 billion  of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poors moodys investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected attracting and retaining qualified personnel may be more difficult than normal as we simplify and restructure the company in addition if we were to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists particularly those with subspecialties with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of diagnostic information services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

  

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data and other personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

if we do not successfully navigate these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our medical diagnostic products business is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant diagnostic products 

our medical diagnostic products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states including the fda and by regulatory authorities outside the united states including the european commission the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market a medical diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and clearance or approval for future products is never certain securing regulatory clearance or approval of additional indications or uses of existing products is not predictable delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain clearance or approval for future products or new indications or uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarket reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns our diagnostic product facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities failure to comply with applicable rules could result in among other things substantial modifications to our business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of our products or products of our suppliers a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability timely to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation revenues profitability or financial condition 

our efforts to develop commercially successful medical diagnostic products may not succeed 

we may commit substantial efforts funds and other resources to developing commercially successful medical diagnostic products a high rate of failure or costly delay is inherent in the development of new medical diagnostic products there is no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the development process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 

table of contents   

failure to achieve market adoption limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products changing customer preferences or changing industry standards innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our medical diagnostic products under development will be launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire products or whether any diagnostic products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2014 we may be required to incur significant expense in implementing the new coding set and if we do not adequately implement it our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests 

the american medical association cpt ®  editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing the 2012 cpt manual adopted approximately 100 of such codes the 2013 cpt manual adopted additional codes and there are now cpt codes covering over 300 molecular tests while cms deferred adoption of the 2012 molecular codes until january 2013 a handful of commercial health plans implemented them in 2012 the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials further in late 2012 cms delegated the payment level determination for the new codes to the medicare contractors currently some contractors are beginning to issue payment and coverage decisions but the payment levels and the methodology for determining how payment will be determined by cms and commercial health plans still remains largely unresolved if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic testing we perform our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert managements attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liabilities with respect to some of these claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

table of contents   

in november 2011 the senate finance committee and the senate judiciary committee commenced an inquiry into certain alleged practices in the laboratory testing and managed care businesses 

in november 2011 we received a letter from senator charles e grassley ranking member of the us senate committee on the judiciary and senator max baucus chairman of the us senate committee on finance requesting information regarding certain alleged practices in the laboratory testing and managed care businesses a similar letter was sent to other companies that sponsor managed care organizations or which are engaged in the laboratory testing business the company has cooperated with the request the company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of this inquiry or its impact on our business similar inquiries may be made by other governmental authorities regarding this or other topics we may experience negative publicity with respect to these matters 

such inquiries may result in a finding of failure to comply with laws or regulations changes in laws or regulations the commencement of civil or criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties or administrative remedies including the loss of the right to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations if the inquiries continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens on our company 

these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in utilization of the us healthcare system 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the united states trends in the utilization of the us healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as unemployment underemployed workers and decisions to delay medical care declining utilization of the us healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

 i tem 1 business 

quest diagnostics incorporated is the world’s leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services we provide insights that enable patients and physicians to make better healthcare decisions 

quest diagnostics was incorporated in delaware in 1990 its predecessor companies date back to 1967 we conduct business through our headquarters in madison new jersey and our laboratories patient service centers offices and other facilities around the united states and in selected locations outside the united states unless the context otherwise requires the terms “quest diagnostics” the “company” “we” and “our” mean quest diagnostics incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries 

during 2011 we generated net revenues of 75 billion and processed approximately 146 million test requisitions additional financial information concerning quest diagnostics including our consolidated subsidiaries and business segments for each of the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “financial statements and supplementary data” in part ii item 8 

o ur strategy and strengths 

our mission is to be the undisputed world leader in diagnostic testing information and services we are dedicated to improving the health of patients through unsurpassed diagnostic insights and innovation and we focus on patients growth and people to help achieve our goals 

  growth strategy we offer high value diagnostic testing services and products attractive to patients physicians payers employers and others we believe that successful execution of our strategy will drive continued growth of our business additionally we believe that over the long term we will be able to grow at a rate above the us clinical laboratory industry growth rate and to expand margins the elements of our growth strategy are described below

  shareholder focus 

we are focused on increasing shareholder returns and returns on invested capital “roic” through a framework that encompasses improving operating performance and disciplined capital deployment to improve our operating performance we are taking steps to accelerate organic revenue growth and to reduce our operating costs we have launched a program to reduce our operating costs by 500 million by the end of 2014 

our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends share repurchases and investment in our business and is intended to improve roic the framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating in 2012 the company expects to use the majority of its free cash flow to reduce its outstanding debt and achieve a debtebitda ratio in the range of 2 – 2¼ times upon achieving our targeted leverage ratio we expect to return to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases a majority of our free cash flow consistent with that expectation we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 70 from 010 per share to 017 per share in january 2012 we expect that the dividend will grow over time commensurate with earnings and cash flows 

we will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner which should require significantly less capital than in recent years as a result of our 2011 acquisitions of athena diagnostics and celera we believe that we have established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities and that it is unlikely that we will complete any large strategic acquisitions in the near term our nearterm investments are likely to focus on smaller foldin acquisitions investments in science and innovation in the form of licensing collaborations and internal development and investments in technology that will improve quality and efficiency in our laboratories and in other parts of our business we anticipate that selective acquisitions will enable us to add capabilities and further strengthen our access and distribution 

b usiness operations 

quest diagnostics is the world’s leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services providing insights that enable patients and physicians to make better healthcare decisions we offer us patients and physicians the broadest access to diagnostic testing services through our nationwide network of laboratories and companyowned patient service centers we provide interpretive consultation through the largest medical and scientific staff in the industry including hundreds of mds and phds primarily located in the united states many of whom are recognized leaders in their fields we are the leading provider of clinical testing including genebased and esoteric testing and anatomic pathology services and the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry we also are a leading provider of testing for clinical trials and testing for drugs of abuse our diagnostics products business manufactures and markets diagnostic test kits and specialized pointofcare testing we empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with robust information technology solutions our activities are described below 

patients are at the center of everything that we do we are leveraging our diagnostic testing capabilities and our assets to serve multiple customer bases most of our services are provided in the united states for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we derived approximately 4 3 and 3 respectively of our revenues from foreign operations and held approximately 6 7 and 7 respectively of our longlived assets outside the united states the following chart shows the percentage of our 2011 net revenues generated by the activities identified 

   clinical testing we are the world’s largest commercial clinical testing company clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services we offer customers the broadest access to the most extensive test menu of clinical laboratory and anatomic pathology tests in the united states clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests typically that are not routine require professional “handson” 

attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory which specializes in performing these complex tests anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues such as biopsies and other samples such as human cells as tests increasingly become more complex we believe that providing sound medical and scientific consultation regarding our tests and test results will help spur the integration of new tests into clinical practice and help physicians best utilize these tests to improve patient outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction to this end our inhouse experts including medical directors scientific directors genetic counselors and board certified geneticists are available for consultation with our customers regarding testing that we perform 

routine clinical testing we are the leading provider of routine clinical testing including testing for drugs of abuse we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories and rapid response laboratories rapid response laboratories are smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times we also perform routine testing at hospital laboratories that we manage we operate laboratories 24 hours a day 365 days a year the majority of test results are delivered electronically 

routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include 

 anatomic pathology testing we are the leading provider of anatomic pathology services in the united states through our ameripath ®  dermpath diagnostics ® and quest diagnostics brands anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients we provide inpatient anatomic pathology and medical director services at hospitals throughout the country and through our major laboratories 

we provide a full range of services to all anatomic pathology subspecialties our experienced staff of hundreds of medical doctors including luminaries in their field have a passion for providing the highest quality service to patients we provide integrated comprehensive reports that include both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology tests enabling our pathologists to offer patients and physicians a complete analysis our approach fosters personalized patient care 

we have a strong history of leadership and innovation in cancer diagnostics we introduced the leumeta ® family of tests for leukemia and lymphoma these proprietary plasmabased molecular tests may some day eliminate the need for painful bone marrow biopsies as discussed below under the heading “scientific innovation” we continue to develop and release new tests to aid in the detection and treatment of cancer 

genebased and esoteric testing we are the leading provider in the united states of genebased and esoteric testing genebased and esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests genetic tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations in 2011 we acquired athena diagnostics ®  a provider of neurology testing establishing the leading position in the growing neurology testing market in 2011 we also acquired celera ® corporation providing immediate access to increased genetic tests as part of this acquisition we also acquired berkeley heartlab enhancing our leading position in advanced cardiovascular testing we conduct complex and specialized testing including molecular diagnostics in our world renowned quest diagnostics nichols institute laboratory facilities and in a number of other locations including focus diagnostics and athena diagnostics 

our esoteric laboratories provide reference testing services to physicians large academic medical centers hospitals and other commercial laboratories our esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of complex tests that are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories including but not limited to the following fields 

 we also offer genebased tests for the predisposition diagnosis treatment and monitoring of cancers we believe that offering a full range of genebased and other esoteric tests strengthens our market offering and market position and enhances our reputation as the nation’s leading test provider 

scientific innovation we are a leading innovator in the clinical testing industry with capabilities ranging from early discovery to validation of clinical tests we develop tests at our laboratories such as quest diagnostics nichols institute we also develop innovative techniques and services in anatomic pathology we collaborate with leading academic centers and maintain relationships with advisors and consultants who are leaders in key fields such as cardiology oncology and infectious disease in connection with our research and development efforts our medical and scientific experts publish in peerreviewed journals research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing in 2011 they published more than 50 articles that provided fundamental insights into the biology of diseases or introduced novel diagnostic testing approaches benefitting patients including in such areas as cardiovascular genetics mass spectrometry small molecule and protein diagnostics and novel cancer diagnostic markers they also help to shape the latest thinking as the authors of textbooks or chapters therein used by academic institutions to train healthcare providers 

we successfully transfer technical innovations to the market through our relationships with technology developers including the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms our inhouse expertise and our collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we search for new opportunities and continue to build a robust pipeline of new tests in predisposition screening diagnosis prognosis and treatment choice which assists physicians in early detection of diseases and may reduce healthcare costs in 2011 we acquired celera adding leading genetic ivd products and development capabilities celera develops manufactures and commercializes test kits and reagents and is a leading provider of molecular test products for transplantation genetics cystic fibrosis hiv drug resistance and fragile x syndrome as part of our 2011 acquisition of celera we also gained access to a pipeline of biomarkers to drive sustainable growth in 2011 we also announced a multiyear exclusive collaboration with genomic vision a biotechnology company involving genomic vision’s proprietary molecular combing genomicanalysis technology under the agreement we have exclusive rights to develop and offer clinical and research use laboratory testing services based on genomic vision’s molecular combing technique in the united states india and mexico we expect to release laboratory developed tests based on molecular combing technology and also may offer molecular combingbased laboratory testing services for new drug development to pharmaceutical companies through our clinical trials business and for research use to academic institutions through our strengths in assay development and the commercialization of test services we believe that we are the partner of choice for developers of new technologies and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we focus our resources on key disease states including cancer cardiovascular disease infectious disease and neurological conditions we seek technologies that help doctors care for their patients through better predisposition screening monitoring diagnosis prognosis and treatment choices we also look for tests that are less invasive than currently available options to increase the choices that physicians and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples with these priorities in mind we recently introduced a number of new or enhanced tests including those discussed below

   healthcare information technology we provide interoperable technologies that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter share and access clinical information without costly it implementation or significant workflow disruption including through our care360 ® suite of products and our chartmaxx ® electronic document management system for hospitals these solutions offer access to a large national healthcare provider network including approximately 200000 networked physicians and clinicians using quest diagnostics’ care360 connectivity products we believe that these products enhance the value we provide to our customers and result in increased customer loyalty by providing more convenient ordering and reporting of clinical tests greater convenience in electronically prescribing medication and providing better access to clinical information we believe that our healthcare information technology capabilities differentiate us from the competition 

the care360 products including our care360 labs and meds enable physicians electronically to order diagnostic tests and review test results from quest diagnostics and electronically to prescribe medication at the end of 2011 prescriptions were written through care360 eprescribing at an annualized rate of 32 million medications our care360 ehr product which is certified as a complete electronic health record by the certification commission for health information technology allows physicians to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter automates and streamlines the clinician’s workflow and allows for rapid deployment and implementation with minimal workflow disruption the solution allows doctors to electronically create manage and distribute patient encounter notes including vital signs and progress notes it captures lab and radiology results provides clinical decision support tools and allows doctors to send secure messages and clinical information to other practitioners and secure webbased laboratory results to their patients’ personal health records physicians also take advantage of our new care360 mobile application that lets them review results and order medications using their smartphones or mobile devices care360 was named the top standalone eprescribing system of 2011 by black book rankings 

in 2011 for the eighth time in the past ten years chartmaxx was awarded the best in klas award for the document management and imaging category it is being used by over 400000 clinical and administrative users in hospitals and other clinical locations our care360 data exchange is the delivery mechanism for clinical transactions including bidirectional transmission of orders and results involving the acute care and ambulatory settings 

we are a leader in providing patients with advanced tools to manage their health using our care360 connectivity products physicians can securely provide diagnostic and other data to a patient’s account we offer gazelle ®  a secure mobile health platform that allows users to receive their quest diagnostics laboratory results manage their personal health information find a quest diagnostics location and schedule appointments directly from their smartphone 

  clinical trials testing we believe that we are the second largest provider of central laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs vaccines and certain medical devices clinical research trials are required by the fda and nonus international regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs vaccines and some medical devices we see opportunities to develop pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic tests to help speed drug approval processes for our clinical trials customers and capitalizing on the trend to personalized medicine to better focus patient therapy based on a patient’s genetic markers we have biomarker capabilities that advance our efforts to develop these tests in 2011 we acquired celera enhancing our ability to provide biomarker discovery and develop ivd test kits as a result we now offer an “end to end” array of services for companion diagnostics 

we have clinical trials testing centers in the united states the united kingdom and india and we provide clinical trials testing in argentina brazil china and singapore through affiliated laboratories we serve most of the major pharmaceutical companies 

  life insurer services we are the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in north america we also provide risk assessment services for insurance companies doing business in many countries outside the united states 

our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life insurance industry including laboratory testing electronic data collection specimen collection and paramedical examinations medical record retrieval case management motor vehicle reports telephone inspections prescription histories and credit checks the laboratory tests that we perform and data we gather are designed to assist insurance companies to objectively evaluate the mortality risks of policy applicants the majority of the testing is performed on specimens of life insurance applicants but also includes specimens of applicants for other types of insurance factors such as the number of applications for underwritten life insurance policies can affect the utilization of clinical testing and other services we provide to our insurance customers most of our specimen collections and paramedical examinations are performed by 

our network of approximately 5000 contracted paramedical examiners at the applicant’s home or workplace we also offer paramedical examinations through approximately 500 of our patient service centers and operate approximately 80 locations other than patient service centers in the united states and canada where we provide paramedical examinations bringing to approximately 580 the total number of sites where we can provide these examinations we also contract with third parties at over an additional 200 locations globally to coordinate providing these exams 

we seek to grow our risk assessment services revenues by increasing our market share and by offering new and innovative laboratory tests data collection and analytics and other services for example in 2011 we were the first in the industry to offer online lab results to life insurance applicants we charge our life insurance customers on a feeforservice basis typically under multiyear agreements 

  employer services we believe that we are a leading provider of testing to employers for the detection of employee use of drugs of abuse our quest diagnostics drug testing index tm  which is an annual report of our aggregate drug testing results is used by employers the federal government and the media to help identify and quantify drug abuse among the nation’s workforce 

we provide a full range of solutions for drugs of abuse including urine hair blood and oral fluid tests we regularly look for opportunities to enhance our test offerings in 2011 we introduced oraleze ®  our own innovative oral fluid collection system that simplifies the collection of oral samples for routine drug testing the oraleze ® oral fluid collector provides all the advantages of previous collection systems with the added benefit of our indicator window technology 

as healthcare costs have increased so has the value of preventive care employers grappling with rising healthcare costs increasingly use wellness screening as a key tool to reduce their healthcare costs and the healthcare risks of their employees we provide wellness testing and analytic services to employers to enable them and their employees to take an active role in improving their health and empower employers with aggregated health information our blueprint for wellness ® program offers employers actionable data to power their health improvement and cost containment programs we are leveraging our patient service centers and paramedical examiner network to deliver wellness screening nationwide we also are exploring offering blueprint for wellness ® through additional channels 

  diagnostic products including pointofcare or nearpatient testing technology advances are enabling testing to move closer to the patient and are becoming increasingly available accurate and cost effective over time some testing that is now done in clinical laboratories will cease to be performed in clinical laboratories and will be performed closer to the patient we believe that our pointofcare testing strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment we are well positioned to offer options and integrated solutions to physicians hospitals and clinics for the testing methods that are most appropriate for each patient and practice 

we develop and manufacture products that enable healthcare professionals to make healthcare diagnoses including products for pointofcare or nearpatient testing for the professional market we have several companies including focus diagnostics hemocue and celera that enhance our offerings and better enable us to serve these markets 

focus diagnostics ® is a leading provider of infectious disease testing that has established a reputation for being first to introduce new tests to the market including diagnostic tests for lyme disease west nile virus sars and most recently h1n1 focus diagnostics develops manufactures and markets diagnostic products such as herpeselect ® elisa tests that detect patient antibodies to specific types of herpes simplex virus which can be performed on a variety of instrument platforms focus diagnostics sells its diagnostic products to large academic medical centers hospitals and commercial laboratories globally focus diagnostics has an agreement with 3m corporation for global human diagnostic rights to a compact integrated benchtop instrument for use with real time polymerase chain reaction “pcr” assays these tests are sold under the simplexa ® brand name in 2011 focus diagnostics received the ce mark to offer several new simplexa tests in europe including tests for cytomegalovirus epstein barr virus bk virus and clostridium difficile  focus diagnostics now offers one of the most comprehensive molecular transplanttesting menus in europe focus diagnostics also registered the simplexa dengue molecular test with the national agency of sanitary vigilance an office of brazil’s federal government for use in public and private health testing in brazil in 2011 focus diagnostics received fda 510k clearance for its simplexa test offering for flu abrsv in 2011 the simplexa3m technology won a gold medical design excellence award in the ivd category and an edison award for new science and medical diagnostics product we intend to develop and pursue fda clearance and ce marking for additional simplexa tm tests 

hemocue ® innovates manufactures and distributes pointofcare testing products globally hemocue is the leading global provider in pointofcare testing for hemoglobin with a growing market share for glucose microalbumin and white blood cell testing hemocue offers its white blood cell differential system in europe and plans in 2012 to 

seek 510k clearance and waived status under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” for this product which if granted would permit physicians to use these products in a much larger segment of physician offices the hemocue handheld systems are used in physician’s offices blood banks hospitals diabetes clinics and public health clinics approximately sixty percent of hemocue products are sold outside the united states 

celera offers a number of market leading high complexity molecular diagnostic products in segments such as hiv1 drug resistance testing reproductive genetics transplantation and cardiovascular genetics celera products which are distributed by a third party worldwide span the various levels of regulatory registrations and are sold to a broad spectrum of customers who require high quality and regulatory approved products we also manufacture and offer the insure ® fecal immunochemical test fit tm  for screening for colorectal cancer 

  international we have laboratory facilities in gurgaon india heston england mexico city mexico and san juan puerto rico these laboratories support clinical testing in their local markets and also may support our clinical trials business we have an office in ireland that supports our activities in that country and also have sales representatives dedicated to offering our diagnostic test products in countries outside the united states we see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic testing and pointofcare products to international markets particularly developing countries where the testing markets are highly fragmented and less mature including by leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets 

t he united states clinical testing market 

most clinical tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories commercial clinical laboratories or physicianoffice laboratories we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

key trends there are a number of key trends that we expect will have a significant impact on the clinical testing business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because clinical testing is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

demographics the growing and aging population the burden of chronic diseases and unmet diagnostic needs may increase the demand for clinical testing 

prevention and wellness we believe that the value of detection prevention wellness and personalized care is recognized more now than ever before consumers employers health plans and government agencies increasingly are focusing on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive care that helps avoid disease physicians increasingly are relying on diagnostic testing to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient costsharing for preventive services and additional provisions that we believe will increase the number of patients that have health insurance and thus better access to diagnostic testing 

science and technology advances medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for personalized or tailored medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is an increasing focus on interconnectivity and electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

customers and payers our customers and payers including physicians health insurance plans employers pharmaceutical companies and others have been consolidating we expect that this trend will continue consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power enhancing purchasing sophistication and encouraging internalization of testing patientcentered medical homes are increasingly being established to deliver patient care in addition federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of “accountable care organizations” and requires implementation of health insurance exchanges which may result in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the united states 

competition the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position new market entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations we also are expanding into new diagnostic testing areas that are highly competitive 

reimbursement pressure  there is a strong focus in the united states on controlling the overall cost of healthcare healthcare market participants including governments are focusing on controlling costs including by potentially changing reimbursement for healthcare services revising test coding changing medical coverage policies preauthorization of lab testing introducing lab spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as accountable care organizations and patientcentered medical homes while pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our company it also creates an opportunity for increased utilization of diagnostic testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare 

healthcare utilization  recently utilization of the healthcare system in the united states has been lower there may be many factors contributing to this result including reduced employment levels benefit plans imposing higher levels of patient responsibility underemployment in the work force and patients delaying medical care 

legislative regulatory and policy environment government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing during 2011 the fda issued several draft guidance documents that if finalized could have a significant impact on our business including among others guidance documents regarding applications for mobile telecommunication devices companion diagnostics products labeled research use only “ruo” or investigational use only “iuo” and modifications to the 510k process federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 and court challenges to that legislation has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to potential and impending changes 

globalization there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems in these countries additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally also may create opportunities 

  customers and payers we provide testing services to a broad range of customers who order clinical testing including physicians hospitals and employers in most cases the customer that orders the testing is not responsible for the payments for services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients such as a health insurance plan selfinsured employer benefit fund an accountable care organization a patient centered medical home or the traditional medicare or medicaid program 2 the patient or 3 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 

  health plans health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for clinical testing services performed reimbursement from our two largest health plans totaled approximately 12 of our consolidated net revenues in 2011 our largest health plan accounted for approximately 8 of our consolidated net revenues in 2011 

health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from clinical testing the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain markets such as california health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” or other alternative delivery systems eg physician hospital organizations the ability to negotiate for clinical testing services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that clinical test service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us health plans continue to offer preferred provider organization “ppo” plans pointofservice “pos” plans consumer driven health plans “cdhps” and limited benefit coverage programs reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements we do not expect that the design of these plans will pose a significant barrier to patients accessing clinical testing services to the extent that plans and programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans however have limited their laboratory network to only a single national laboratory seeking to obtain improved pricing 

although noncontracted providers historically generally were reimbursed at “reasonable and customary” rates health plans today are employing several approaches to limit reimbursement to noncontracted providers contracted rates generally are lower than “reasonable and customary” rates 

we also sometimes are a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of testing services by offering health plans services and programs that leverage our company’s expertise and resources including our superior access extensive test menu medical staff and data and in such areas as wellness and disease management 

physicians physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical testing volume physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network quality price and depth and breadth of test and service offering physicians also purchase and utilize our pointofcare tests 

hospitals hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing often are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospital’s histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform tests their patients need and may compete with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves we believe that our combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation innovative connectivity products pointofcare testing products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals 

most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory in recent years there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices and as a result an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus are frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships 

employers employers use clinical tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individual’s employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high employee turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugs of abuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer employers our blueprint for wellness ® program providing wellness screening and analytic services to employers to help employers and their employees manage increasing healthcare costs and to capitalize on trends in personalized health 

other laboratories and other customers  we also provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and perform esoteric testing services for other commercial clinical laboratories these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

g eneral 

  competition while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a testing provider including 

 we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas we also believe that offering the most comprehensive test menu in the industry innovative test and information technology offerings a superior patient experience a staff including medical and scientific experts six sigma quality and unparalleled access and distribution provide us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve customers including members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical testing industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors in addition recent market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national clinical laboratories from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional laboratories and increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our revenues with our pointofcare test strategy we are positioning ourselves to service this growing market for physicians and hospitals we also believe that our overall pointofcare test strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment 

the markets for diagnostic products life insurance risk assessment services clinical trials and healthcare information technology are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these markets and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products market 

by attempting to find and exploit unique differentiated products including products that take advantage of our healthcare information technology solutions we compete in the life insurance risk assessment services business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of highest quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the world’s leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions we compete in the healthcare information technology market by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare institutions patients and physician practices particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices 

  sales and marketing our sales force is organized to focus on customer groups and service types the majority of representatives focus on physician services cancer diagnostics and hospital clients the physician services team is our largest and includes specialty representatives our cancer diagnostics team focuses on physicians who routinely screen for or treat cancer our hospital client sales organization focuses on meeting the unique clinical testing needs of hospitals and other commercial clinical laboratories a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling drugs of abuse and wellness testing to employers in addition we have sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products and instruments including pointofcare tests and our healthcare information technology products we also have dedicated sales teams that focus on selling risk assessment services in the life insurance market and clinical trials services 

  information technology we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical laboratory testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we believe that our healthcare information technology systems help differentiate us favorably we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company patients and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our it systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and as a result we continue to use multiple information systems we have standardized some of our systems and are implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems across our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

  quality assurance in our clinical testing business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we have implemented an enhanced specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification these certifications are international standards for quality management systems in 2011 we continued to take steps to enhance our quality assurance program 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our clinical laboratory operations for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states and other countries they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the united states in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with or audited by the deemed authority for iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations 

  intellectual property rights we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we generally actively defend our intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

  employees at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 42000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

b illing and reimbursement 

  billing we generally bill for clinical testing services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

 billing for clinical testing services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact our bad debt expense in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

  government coverage and reimbursements government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and can be expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years historically many different local carriers administered medicare part b which covers services provided by commercial clinical laboratories they often had inconsistent policies increasing the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories they are being replaced with contractors who will administer both part b and medicare part a benefits for beneficiaries in larger regional areas it is expected that the revised system will reduce the administrative complexity of billing for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

with regard to the clinical test services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing reimbursed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing medicare patients generally are required to make copayments for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services and for pathology and other physician services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule for 2012 is increased by 065 from 2011 levels in december 2011 congress delayed by two months a potential 274 decrease in the physician fee schedule that otherwise would have become effective january 1 2012 the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2011 

 penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for penalties on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these plans in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for traditional medicaid programs 

r egulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in other jurisdictions we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory areas applicable to our businesses 

  clia and state clinical laboratory licensing regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests 

  fraud and abuse rules federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory some states also have similar laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

  fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore may conduct inspections related to testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugs of abuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as laboratorydeveloped tests “ldts” the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories during 2011 the fda issued several draft guidance documents related to our business including among others guidance documents regarding software applications used for handheld devices companion diagnostics products labeled ruo or iuo and enhancements to the 510k process during 2012 the fda plans to issue three guidance documents regarding regulation of ldts and clinical laboratories the first concerns how laboratories will register and list ldts with the fda the second sets forth the riskbased scheme for ldt classification and the third advises laboratories how to become compliant with quality systems regulations if finalized each of these guidance documents could have a significant impact on our business the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests 

our diagnostic product business is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products prior to commercially marketing or selling most diagnostic products in the united states we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda similarly we may need to obtain a license or certification such as a ce mark in order to sell diagnostic products outside of the united states compliance with the ivdd allows us to market in europe once we obtain a ce mark obtainable where the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic inspections and reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions where appropriate voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls may be undertaken 

  environmental health and safety we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the us this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to 

protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

  physicians many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

several states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

  privacy and security of health and personal information we are required to comply with laws and regulations in the united states at the federal and state levels and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business including the european union india and mexico regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information these privacy and security laws include the federal health insurance portability and accountability act as amended and the regulations thereunder collectively “hipaa” the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding electronic protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information together these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects provide for penalties for noncompliance and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of unsecured personal or a patient’s protected health information we have implemented policies and practices designed to meet applicable requirements 

  drug testing controlled substances all us laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform such testing or that utilize controlled substances are so certified or so licensed respectively 

  compliance we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement of tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and 

authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on theories as to our current practices that we believe are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs reimbursement from traditional medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 18 of our net revenues during 2011 we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

 i tem 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 

this report also includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks or uncertainties our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the 

risks we face described below and elsewhere see “cautionary factors that may affect future results” on page 30 

continued weakness in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the economies of the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business continue to experience significant weakness which in the case of the us has resulted in significant unemployment and reduced economic activity continued weakness or a further decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products thus reducing our revenue these conditions also could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical test providers other commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position our failure to provide a broad test menu or service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and profitability could be damaged 

us healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare the legislation provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories beginning in 2013 the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations a new healthcare delivery model while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

government payers and healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

our business could be adversely impacted by the fda’s approach to regulation 

during 2011 the fda issued several draft guidance documents related to our business including among others guidance documents regarding software applications used for handheld devices companion diagnostics products labeled ruo and iuo and enhancements to the 510k process 

laboratories use analyte specific reagents “asrs” in some ldts under current fda guidance manufacturers of certain products marketed as asrs must comply with fda regulations in order to be marketed in the united states in its draft guidance on ruo and iuo labeled products the fda proposes to increase its scrutiny of reagents kits instruments and software labeled ruo and iuo and threatened to take regulatory action against manufacturers who know or should know that laboratories are using them in clinical diagnostics testing 

during 2012 the fda plans to issue three guidance documents regarding regulation of ldts and clinical laboratories the first concerns how laboratories will register and list ldts with the fda the second sets forth the riskbased scheme for ldt classification and the third advises laboratories how to become compliant with quality systems regulations 

if finalized each of the fda’s guidance documents could have a significant impact on our business for example the proposed guidance regarding ruo and iuo labeled products could result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining needed supplies or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain the supplies the fda’s guidance documents may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services or cause an increase in the cost of our products or services they also may hinder our ability to perform tests these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis cms changes add to our costs by increasing complexity and administrative requirements for billing medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for traditional medicaid programs recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us during 2011 congress considered several costsaving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions these initiatives included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services copayments for clinical laboratory tests and further laboratory fee schedule reductions if any of these initiatives were implemented it could materially affect us 

the american medical association cpt® editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular tests the 2012 cpt manual adopts approximately 100 of such codes and it is anticipated that such codes will eventually cover hundreds of molecular tests while cms has deferred adoption of the new molecular codes until 2013 a handful of commercial health plans are implementing them the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payors to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials further payment levels for the new codes or even the methodology for determining how payment will be determined remains unresolved if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic tests we perform our revenues and 

earnings could be adversely impacted 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

healthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including healthcare plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these healthcare plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing some healthcare plans also are considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among healthcare plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as strategic acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that was previously operated independently and has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the 

operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal and state enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of 

operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information customers and business opportunities 

information technology “it” systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions computer viruses unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems nevertheless we may experience damages to our systems system failures and interruptions and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and our data could be compromised 

in addition we are in the process of implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems which we expect will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for tests in a timely manner 

if we experience systems problems or if we experience unauthorized disclosure of confidential information it could adversely affect our reputation result in a loss of customers and revenues and cause us to suffer financial damage including significant costs to alleviate or eliminate the problem 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests that may result in a decrease in the demand for our tests or cause us to reduce the prices of our tests our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients or the internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices although physicians operating inoffice laboratories incur additional costs for clia compliance manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing to physicians pointofcare test equipment and test kits that require minimal regulatory oversight further diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our revenues 

some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services have added inoffice histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site thus allowing them to bill for services previously referred to outside pathology service providers such as the company these customers include specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures such as dermatologists gastroenterologists urologists and oncologists if our customers continue to internalize tests that we currently perform the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our revenues may be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 40 billion of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn 

entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees including a qualified new chief executive officer is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel including a qualified new chief executive officer or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists particularly those with subspecialties with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of clinical testing services including anatomic pathology services and related services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

the failure of our it systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 

public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology “hcit” standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including test orders and test results could require costly modifications to our existing hcit systems while we do not expect hcit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing hcit standards we could lose customers and business opportunities 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data or personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

if we do not successfully navigate these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our medical diagnostic products business is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant diagnostics products 

our medical diagnostic products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states including the fda and by regulatory authorities outside the united states including the european commission the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market a medical diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and clearance or approval for future products is never certain securing regulatory clearance or approval of additional indications or uses of existing products is not predictable delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain clearance or approval for future products or new indications or uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarket reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns our diagnostic product facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities failure to comply with applicable rules could result in among other things substantial modifications to our business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of our products or products of our suppliers a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability timely to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation revenues profitability or financial condition 

our efforts to develop commercially successful medical diagnostic products may not succeed 

we may commit substantial efforts funds and other resources to developing commercially successful medical diagnostic products a high rate of failure or costly delay is inherent in the development of new medical diagnostic products there is no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the development process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals failure to achieve market adoption limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products changing customer preferences or changing industry standards innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our medical diagnostic products under development will be launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire products or whether any diagnostic products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees’ ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2013 we may be required to incur significant expense in implementing the new coding set and if we do not adequately implement it our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests 

the american medical association cpt® editorial panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular tests the 2012 cpt manual adopts approximately 100 of such codes and it is anticipated that such codes will eventually cover hundreds of molecular tests while cms has deferred adoption of the new molecular codes until 2013 a handful of commercial health plans are implementing them the adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payors to better determine tests being performed this could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials further payment levels for the new codes or even the methodology for determining how payment will be determined remains unresolved if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic tests we perform our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management’s attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

the senate finance committee and the senate judiciary committee are conducting an inquiry into certain alleged practices in the laboratory testing and managed care businesses 

in november 2011 we received a letter from senator charles e grassley ranking member of the us senate committee on the judiciary and senator max baucus chairman of the us senate committee on finance requesting information regarding certain alleged practices in the laboratory testing and managed care businesses a similar letter was sent to other companies that sponsor managed care organizations or which are engaged in the laboratory testing business the company is cooperating with the request the company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of this inquiry or its impact on our business similar inquiries may be made by other governmental authorities regarding 

this or other topics we may experience negative publicity with respect to these matters 

such inquiries may result in a finding of failure to comply with laws or regulations changes in laws or regulations the commencement of civil or criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties or administrative remedies including the loss of the right to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations if the inquiries continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens on our company 

these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in utilization of the us healthcare system 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the united states trends in the utilization of the us healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as the unemployment rate underemployed workers and decisions to delay medical care declining utilization of the us healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

patients are at the center of everything that we do we are leveraging our diagnostic testing capabilities and our assets to serve multiple customer bases most of our services are provided in the united states for each of the years ended december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 we derived approximately 3 of our revenues from foreign operations and held approximately 7 of our longlived assets outside the united states the following chart shows the percentage of our 2010 net revenues generated by the activities identified 

 clinical testing we are the world’s largest commercial clinical testing company clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services we offer customers the broadest access to the most extensive test menu of clinical laboratory and anatomic pathology tests in the united states clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests that are not routine require highly skilled personnel and generally require more sophisticated equipment anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues such as biopsies and 

other samples such as human cells as tests increasingly become more complex we believe that providing sound medical and scientific consultation regarding our tests and test results will help spur the integration of new tests into clinical practice and help physicians best utilize these tests to improve patient outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction to this end our inhouse experts including medical directors scientific directors genetic counselors and board certified geneticists are available for consultation with our customers regarding testing that we perform 

  routine clinical testing  we are the leading provider of routine clinical testing including testing for drugsofabuse we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories and rapid response laboratories rapid response laboratories are smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times we also perform routine testing at hospital laboratories that we manage we operate laboratories 24 hours a day 365 days a year performing and reporting most routine tests within 24 hours the majority of test results are delivered electronically 

routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include 

   anatomic pathology testing  we are the leading provider of anatomic pathology services in the united states through our ameripath tm  dermpath diagnostics tm and quest diagnostics brands anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients we provide inpatient anatomic pathology and medical director services at hospitals throughout the country and through our major laboratories 

we provide a full range of services to all anatomic pathology subspecialties we have approximately 725 medical doctors including luminaries in their field with a passion for providing the highest quality service to patients among them are approximately 700 pathologists we provide integrated comprehensive reports that include both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology tests enabling our pathologists to offer patients and physicians a complete analysis our approach fosters personalized patient care 

we have a strong history of leadership and innovation in cancer diagnostics we introduced the leumeta ® family of tests for leukemia and lymphoma these proprietary plasmabased molecular tests may some day eliminate the need for painful bone marrow biopsies as discussed below under the heading “scientific innovation” recently we introduced our lung cancer mutation panel designed to aid treatment selection for lung cancer patients this panel detects mutations in the efgr alk and kras genes this panel together with our numerous individual tests for lung cancer mutations provides the most comprehensive lung cancer test offerings available from a commercial laboratory 

  genebased and esoteric testing  we are the leading provider in the united states of genebased and esoteric testing genebased and esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations esoteric tests typically require professional “handson” attention from highlyskilled technical personnel generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests it is not practical from a costeffectiveness or infrastructure perspective for most hospitals commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory which specializes in performing these complex tests we conduct complex and specialized testing including molecular diagnostics in our world renowned quest diagnostics nichols institute laboratory facilities and in a number of other locations including focus 

diagnostics 

our esoteric laboratories provide reference testing services to physicians large academic medical centers hospitals and other commercial laboratories our esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of complex tests that are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories including but not limited to the following fields 

 we also offer genebased tests for the predisposition diagnosis treatment and monitoring of cancers we believe that offering a full range of genebased and other esoteric tests strengthens our market offering and market position and enhances our reputation as the nation’s leading test provider 

  scientific innovation  we are a leading innovator in the clinical testing industry with capabilities ranging from early discovery to validation of clinical tests we develop tests at our laboratories such as quest diagnostics nichols institute we also develop innovative techniques in anatomic pathology we collaborate with leading academic centers and maintain relationships with advisors and consultants that are leaders in key fields such as cardiology oncology and infectious disease in connection with our research and development efforts our medical and scientific experts publish in peerreviewed journals research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing in 2010 they published more than 30 articles that provided fundamental insights into the biology of diseases or introduced novel diagnostic testing approaches benefitting patients they also help to shape the latest thinking as the authors of textbooks or chapters therein used by academic institutions to train healthcare providers we successfully transfer technical innovations to the market through our relationships with technology developers including the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms our inhouse expertise and our collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we search for new opportunities and continue to build a robust pipeline of new tests in predisposition screening diagnosis prognosis and treatment choice which assists physicians in early detection of diseases and may reduce healthcare costs through our strengths in assay development and the commercialization of test services we believe that we are the partner of choice for developers of new technologies and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we focus our resources on key disease states and technologies that help doctors care for their patients through better predisposition screening monitoring diagnosis prognosis and treatment choices we also look for tests that are less invasive than currently available options to increase the choices that physicians and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples with these priorities in mind we recently introduced a number of new or enhanced tests including those discussed below

 healthcare information technology we empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with information technology solutions that can help improve patient care and medical practice through our care360 tm suite of products centergy data exchange and the chartmaxx ® electronic document management system for hospitals we provide interoperable technologies that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter share and access clinical information without costly it implementation or significant workflow disruption these solutions offer access to a large national healthcare provider network including approximately 160000 networked physicians using quest diagnostics’ care360 connectivity products we believe that these products enhance the value we provide to our customers and result in increased customer loyalty by providing more convenient ordering and reporting of clinical tests greater convenience in 

electronically prescribing medication and providing better access to clinical information 

the care360 products including our care360 labs and meds enable physicians electronically to order diagnostic tests and review test results from quest diagnostics and electronically to prescribe medication since december 2009 the number of medications written through care360 eprescribing has grown to an annualized rate of approximately 22 million our care360 ehr product allows physicians to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter automates and streamlines the clinician’s workflow and allows for rapid deployment and implementation with minimal workflow disruption the solution allows doctors to electronically create manage and distribute patient encounter notes including vital signs and progress notes it captures lab and radiology results provides clinical decision support tools and allows doctors to send secure messages and clinical information to other practitioners and secure webbased laboratory results to their patients’ personal health records physicians also take advantage of our new care360 mobile application that lets them review results and order medications using their apple ® iphone ® or ipad ®  

in december 2010 the care360 ehr solution received oncatcb 201112 certification as a complete ehr from the certification commission for health information technology the 20112012 criteria support the stage 1 meaningful use measures required to qualify eligible providers and hospitals for funding under the american recovery and reinvestment act which included laws designed to expedite the implementation of electronic health records and build a national electronic health infrastructure in the united states we believe that we are well positioned to enable physicians to participate in this government stimulus program 

in 2010 for the seventh time in the past nine years chartmaxx was awarded the 1 in klas award for the document management and imaging category it is being used by over 400000 clinical and administrative users in hospitals and other clinical locations our centergy ® data exchange is the delivery mechanism for clinical transactions including bidirectional transmission of orders and results involving the acute care and ambulatory settings 

we are a leader in providing patients with advanced tools to manage their health we collaborate with keas microsoft and google in connection with their personal health records offerings using our care360 connectivity products physicians can securely provide diagnostic and other data to a patient’s account in 2010 we introduced gazelle tm  a secure mobile health platform that allows users to receive their quest diagnostics laboratory results and manage their personal health information directly from their smartphone with gazelle users can see store and share their vital health information with ease and security on a mobile basis gazelle also features a mobile appointment scheduling application and allows patients to find a quest diagnostics location 

we believe that our healthcare information technology capabilities and our collaboration with others regarding healthcare information technology initiatives differentiate us from the competition 

clinical trials testing we believe that we are the second largest provider of central laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs vaccines and certain medical devices clinical research trials are required by the fda and other international regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs and vaccines we see opportunities to develop pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic tests to help speed drug approval processes for our clinical trials customers and capitalizing on the trend to personalized medicine to better focus patient therapy based on a patient’s genetic markers we have biomarker capabilities that advance our efforts to develop these tests 

we have clinical trials testing centers in the united states and the united kingdom and we provide clinical trials testing in argentina australia brazil china and singapore through affiliated laboratories while we serve most of the major pharmaceutical companies approximately 32 of our net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2010 represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc “gsk” we are the primary provider of central laboratory testing to support gsk’s clinical trials testing requirements worldwide 

life insurer services we are the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in north america we also provide risk assessment services for insurance companies doing business in many countries outside the united states 

our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life insurance industry including clinical testing teleunderwriting specimen collection and paramedical examinations medical record retrieval case management motor vehicle reports telephone inspections prescription histories and credit checks the clinical tests that we perform and data we gather are designed to assist insurance companies to objectively evaluate the mortality risks of policy applicants the majority of the testing is performed on specimens of life insurance applicants but also includes specimens of applicants for other types of insurance factors such as the number of applications for underwritten life insurance policies can affect the utilization of clinical testing and other services we provide to our 

insurance customers most of our specimen collections and paramedical examinations are performed by our network of approximately 5275 contracted paramedical examiners at the applicant’s home or workplace we also offer paramedical examinations through approximately 500 of our patient service centers and operate approximately 75 locations other than patient service centers in the united states and canada where we provide paramedical examinations bringing to approximately 575 the total number of sites where we can provide these examinations we also contract with third parties at over an additional 120 locations across the united states and canada to coordinate providing these exams 

we seek to grow our insurance revenues by increasing our market share and by offering new and innovative clinical tests data collection and analytics and other services our life insurance customers have been consolidating which has resulted in increased individual customer purchasing power we expect that this trend will continue we charge our life insurance customers on a feeforservice basis typically under multiyear agreements 

employer services we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical testing to employers for the detection of employee use of drugsofabuse our quest diagnostics drug testing index tm  which is an annual report of our aggregate drug testing results is used by employers the federal government and the media to help identify and quantify drug abuse among the nation’s workforce 

as healthcare costs have increased so has the value of preventative care employers grappling with increased healthcare costs use wellness testing as a key tool to reduce their healthcare costs and the healthcare risks of their employees we provide wellness testing and analytic services to employers to enable them and their employees to take an active role in improving their health and empower employers with aggregated health information our blueprint for wellness ® program offers employers actionable data to power their health improvement and cost containment programs we are leveraging our patient service centers and paramedical network to deliver wellness screening nationwide we also offer blueprint for wellness ® directly to individuals 

diagnostic products including pointofcare or near patient testing technology advances are enabling testing to move closer to the patient and are becoming increasingly available accurate and cost effective over time some testing that is now done in clinical laboratories will cease to be performed in clinical laboratories and will be performed closer to the patient we believe that our pointofcare testing strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment we are well positioned to offer options and integrated solutions to physicians hospitals and clinics for the testing methods that are most appropriate for each patient and practice 

we develop and manufacture products that enable healthcare professionals to make healthcare diagnoses including products for pointofcare or near patient testing for the professional market we have several companies including focus diagnostics enterix and hemocue that enhance our offerings and better enable us to serve these markets we will consider additional acquisitions or licenses of selective products to complement the products and services we provide the results of several of our pointofcare tests can be entered into our care360 tm system and hospital laboratory information systems so that they are available in electronic medical records we intend to offer additional data links in the future this will differentiate our pointofcare test products from other products that are not integrated into an electronic repository 

focus diagnostics is a leading provider of infectious disease testing that has established a reputation for being first to introduce new tests to the market including diagnostic tests for lyme disease west nile virus sars and most recently h1n1 focus diagnostics develops manufactures and markets diagnostic products such as herpeselect ® elisa tests that detect patient antibodies to specific types of herpes simplex virus which can be performed on a variety of instrument platforms focus diagnostics sells its diagnostic products to large academic medical centers hospitals and commercial laboratories globally focus has an agreement with 3m corporation for global human diagnostic rights to a compact integrated benchtop instrument for use with real time polymerase chain reaction “pcr” assays these tests are sold under the simplexa tm brand name in 2010 focus received fda 510k clearance for the benchtop instrument the simplexa tm h1n1 influenza test and the simplexa tm flu ab and rsv test for the instrument each test also has received the ce mark for sale in europe we intend to develop and pursue fda clearance and ce marking for additional simplexa tm tests 

hemocue manufactures and distributes pointofcare testing products hemocue is the leading global provider in pointofcare testing for hemoglobin with a growing market share for glucose microalbumin and white blood cell testing in 2010 hemocue added a room temperature version of its high sensitivity glucose test in the eu hemocue is seeking fda 510k clearance for this test in the us hemocue also began to market and deliver its white blood cell analyzer a wholeblood test performed on fingerstick samples in both single worldwide and differential in europe counts we are seeking 510k clearance and waived status under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” for this product which if granted would permit physicians to use these products in a much larger segment of 

physician offices the hemocue handheld systems are used in physician’s offices blood banks hospitals diabetes clinics and public health clinics approximately onehalf of hemocue products are sold outside the united states we believe that hemocue has a strong product development pipeline based on its pioneering use of its patented microfluidic systems 

enterix an australiabased company manufactures the insure ® fecal immunochemical test fit tm  for screening for colorectal cancer 

international we have laboratory facilities in gurgaon india heston england mexico city mexico and san juan puerto rico these laboratories support clinical testing in their local markets and also may support our clinical trials business we have an office in ireland that supports our activities in that country and also have sales representatives dedicated to offering our pointofcare test products in countries outside the united states we see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic testing and pointofcare products to international markets particularly developing countries where the testing markets are highly fragmented and less mature including by leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets 

t he united states clinical testing market 

most clinical tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories commercial clinical laboratories or physicianoffice laboratories we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

key trends there are a number of key trends that we expect to have a significant impact on the clinical testing business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks however because clinical testing is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

  demographics  the growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing 

  prevention and wellness  we believe that the value of detection prevention wellness and personalized care is recognized more now than ever before consumers employers health plans and government agencies increasingly are focusing on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease physicians increasingly are relying on diagnostic testing to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient costsharing for preventative services and additional provisions that we believe will increase the number of patients that have health insurance and thus better access to diagnostic testing 

  science and technology advances  medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for personalized or tailored medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is an increasing focus on interconnectivity and electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

  customers and payers  our customers and payers including physicians health insurance plans employers pharmaceutical companies and others have been consolidating we expect that this trend will continue consolidation is increasing bargaining power enhancing purchasing sophistication and encouraging internalization of testing in addition federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of “accountable care organizations” and requires implementation of health insurance exchanges which may result in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the united states 

  competition  the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position new market entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations we also are expanding into new diagnostic testing areas that are highly competitive 

  legislative regulatory and policy environment  government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act included laws designed to expedite the implementation of electronic health records and build a national electronic health infrastructure in the united states during 2010 the fda publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to potential and impending changes 

  globalization  there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems in these countries additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally may also create opportunities 

customers and payers we provide testing services to a broad range of customers with orders for clinical testing generally generated by physicians hospitals and employers in most cases the customer that orders the testing is not responsible for the payments for services depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients such as a health insurance plan selfinsured employer benefit fund or the traditional medicare or medicaid program 2 the patient or 3 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 

  health plans  health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for clinical testing services performed reimbursement from our two largest health plans totaled approximately 13 of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 our largest health plan accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 

health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from clinical testing the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain markets such as california health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” the ability to negotiate for clinical testing services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that clinical test service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically lower than our overall average reimbursement rate health plans continue to offer preferred provider organization “ppo” plans pointofservice “pos” plans consumer driven health plans “cdhps” and limited benefit coverage programs reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements we do not expect that the design of these plans will pose a significant barrier to accessing clinical testing services to the extent that plans and programs require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans however have limited their laboratory network to only a single national laboratory seeking to obtain improved pricing although noncontracted providers historically generally were reimbursed at “reasonable and customary” rates health plans today are employing several approaches including “reasonable and customary” rates to reimburse noncontracted providers contracted rates generally are lower than “reasonable and customary” rates 

we also sometimes are a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of testing services by offering health plans services and programs that leverage our company’s expertise and resources including our superior access extensive test menu medical staff and data and in such areas as wellness and disease management 

  physicians  physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical testing volume physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network price and depth and breadth of test and service offering physicians also purchase and utilize our pointofcare tests 

  hospitals  hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing typically are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospital’s histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform tests their patients need and may compete with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves we believe that our combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation innovative connectivity products pointofcare testing products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals 

most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus are frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships 

  employers  employers use clinical tests for drugsofabuse to determine an individual’s employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high employee turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugsofabuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer employers our blueprint for wellness program providing wellness screening and analytic services to employers to help employers and their employees manage increasing healthcare costs and to capitalize on trends in personalized health 

  other laboratories and other customers  we also provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and perform esoteric testing services for commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

g eneral 

competition while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized esoteric laboratories and laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities andor bring pathologists into their practices thereby reducing referrals from these practices 

we believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a testing provider including 

 11 

 we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas we also believe that offering the most comprehensive test menu in the industry innovative test and information technology offerings a superior patient experience six sigma quality and unparalleled access and distribution provides us with a competitive advantage 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve customers including members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical testing industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors in addition recent market activity may increase the competitive environment for example health plan actions to exclude large national clinical laboratories from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional laboratories and increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospitalaffiliated laboratories 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our revenues with our pointofcare test strategy we are positioning ourselves to service this growing market for physicians and hospitals we also believe that our overall pointofcare test strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment 

the diagnostic product life insurance services clinical trials and healthcare information technology markets are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these markets and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products market by attempting to find and exploit unique differentiated products including products that take advantage of our healthcare information technology solutions we compete in the life insurance services business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of highest quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the world’s leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions we compete in the healthcare information technology market by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare institutions patients and physician practices particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices 

sales and marketing our sales force is organized to focus on customer groups and service types the majority of representatives focus on marketing clinical laboratory testing anatomic pathology and related services to physicians including physician specialists supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex tests in the insurance market we have a sales force that focuses on regional and national insurance organizations as well as a sales team that sells risk assessment services to life insurance companies we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on meeting the unique clinical testing needs of hospitals a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling drugsofabuse and wellness testing to employers we also have a sales force that focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to local insurance agents and brokers in addition we have a sales organization that focuses on selling diagnostic products and instruments to hospitals commercial clinical laboratories physician office laboratories blood banks and clinics and a sales force that sells our pointofcare tests to customers globally given the highly specialized requirements of drug developers we also have a dedicated sales force that sells our clinical trials services in addition we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and profitability of all accounts 

information technology we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical laboratory testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we believe that our healthcare information technology systems help differentiate us favorably we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company patients and customers the successful delivery of our 

services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and we continue to use nonstandardized billing laboratory or other core information systems we have standardized some of our systems and are implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems across our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance in our clinical testing business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on preanalytic analytic and postanalytic processes including positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we have implemented an enhanced specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification these certifications are international standards for quality management systems in 2010 we took a number of steps to further enhance our quality assurance program including actions to reduce errors to measure and monitor performance and to drive process discipline 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our clinical laboratory operations for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states europe and australia they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the us in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with or audited by the deemed authority for iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations in addition the diagnostics products businesses maintain procedures designed to ensure that products we purchase conform to their specifications 

intellectual property rights we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we generally actively defend our intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty 

testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

employees at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 42000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

b illing and reimbursement 

billing we generally bill for clinical testing services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees may be negotiated or discounted the types of fee schedules are 

 billing for clinical testing services is very complicated and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

in 2010 our bad debt expense was 4 of our net revenues we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact our bad debt expense in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and can be expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients in addition the final 2011 physician fee schedule rule includes a requirement that all laboratory requisitions with the exception of electronic orders contain the ordering physician’s signature in order to be billable to medicare cms had postponed this requirement until the beginning of the second quarter of 2011 recent published reports indicate that cms plans to rescind this requirement however cms has not officially announced its decision 

the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years historically many different local carriers administered medicare part b which covers services provided by commercial clinical laboratories they often had inconsistent policies increasing the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories they are being replaced with contractors who will administer part b benefits for beneficiaries in larger regional areas it is expected that the revised system will reduce the administrative complexity of billing for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

with regard to the clinical test services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in 

addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing medicare patients generally are required to make copayments for anatomic pathology services 

part b of the medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services and for pathology and other physician services performed for covered patients including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare clinical testing fee schedules the medicare national fee schedule for clinical testing services for 2011 is reduced by 175 from 2010 levels as a result of the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation this reduction is the first of a series of such annual reductions effective from 2011 to 2015 in december 2010 congress delayed by one year a potential 30 decrease in the physician fee schedule that otherwise would have become effective january 1 2011 the following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2010 

 penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for penalties on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these plans in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for traditional medicaid programs 

r egulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations over aspects of our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting our business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory areas applicable to our businesses 

clia and state clinical laboratory licensing regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests 

  fraud and abuse rules federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory some states also have similar laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugsofabuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization a number of esoteric tests we develop internally are first offered as laboratorydeveloped tests “ldts” the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories during 2010 the fda publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over ldts and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach the fda has indicated that it will use a riskbased approach to regulation and will direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation the fda has not announced a framework or timetable for implementing its new regulatory approach the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our company including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests 

laboratories use analyte specific reagents “asrs” in some ldts under current fda guidance manufacturers of certain products previously marketed as asrs must file for fda clearance of these products in order to market them in the united states in addition the fda recently has increased its scrutiny of reagents and kits labeled research use only “ruo” or investigational use only “iuo” and has announced that it plans to issue guidance on ruo and iuo labeled products the regulation of asr ruo or iuo products could result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining them or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain the product these factors may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services or cause an increase in the cost of our products or services 

our diagnostic product business is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products prior to commercially marketing or selling most diagnostic products in the us we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda similarly we may need to obtain a license or certification such as a ce mark in order to sell diagnostic products outside of the us compliance with the ivdd allows us to market in europe once we obtain a ce mark obtainable where the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic inspections and reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions where appropriate voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls may be undertaken 

  environmental health and safety we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the us this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

  physicians many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

several states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

  privacy and security of health and personal information we are required to comply with laws and regulations in the united states at the federal and state levels and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business including the european union regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information these privacy and security laws include the federal health insurance portability and accountability act as amended and the regulations thereunder collectively “hipaa” the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding electronic protected health information the hipaa privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information together these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects provide for penalties for noncompliance and may require a healthcare provider to notify patients or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of unsecured personal or a patient’s protected health information we have implemented practices to meet applicable requirements 

  drug testing controlled substances all us laboratories that perform drug testing for public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugsofabuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform such testing or that utilize controlled substances are so certified or so licensed respectively 

  compliance we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement of tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statutes regulations and other laws including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on theories as to our current practices that we believe 

are lawful the federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs reimbursement from traditional medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 18 of our net revenues during 2010 we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 

this report also includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks or uncertainties our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks we face described below and elsewhere see “cautionary factors that may affect future results” on page 28 

continued weakness in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the economies of the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business continue to experience significant weakness which in the case of the us has resulted in significant unemployment and reduced economic activity continued weakness or a further decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products thus reducing our revenue these conditions also could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical test providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their 

medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position our failure to provide a broad test menu or service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and profitability could be damaged 

us healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare the legislation provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories beginning in 2013 the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations a new healthcare delivery model while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fda regulation of ldts and clinical laboratories may result in significant change and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

during 2010 the fda publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over ldts and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach the fda has indicated that it will use a riskbased approach to regulation and will direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation the fda has not announced a framework or timetable for implementing its new regulatory approach the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests while the ultimate impact of the fda’s approach is unknown it may be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis cms changes add to our costs by increasing complexity and administrative requirements for billing medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for 

traditional medicaid programs recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

healthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including healthcare plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these healthcare plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among healthcare plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as strategic acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that was previously operated independently and has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 21 

 if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

as noted above government payers and healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal and state enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business opportunities 

information technology “it” systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems we also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems nevertheless we may experience damages to our systems and system failures and interruptions 

in addition we are in the process of implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems which we expect will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for tests in a timely manner if our operations are interrupted it could 

adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and revenues 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests that may result in a decrease in the demand for our tests or cause us to reduce the prices of our tests our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients or the internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices although clia compliance costs make it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to both physicians and patients of test kits approved by the fda for pointofcare testing or home use development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our revenues 

some of our customers such as hospitals and physicians are internalizing tests that we currently perform including anatomic pathology tests if our customers continue to internalize tests that we currently perform and we do not develop new or alternative tests attractive to our customers the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our revenues may be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 30 billion of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings there can be no 

assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists particularly those with subspecialties with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of clinical testing services including anatomic pathology services and related services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

the failure of our it systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 

public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology “hcit” standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including test orders and test results could require costly modifications to our existing hcit systems while we do not expect hcit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing hcit standards we could lose customers and business opportunities 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data or personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our expanding international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in local jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

we expect to expand further our international operations through acquisition or otherwise which would increase these risks as a result of these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our medical diagnostic products business is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant diagnostics products 

our medical diagnostic products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states including the fda and by regulatory authorities outside the united states including the european commission the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market a medical diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and clearance or approval for future products is never certain securing regulatory clearance or approval of additional indications or uses of existing products is not predictable delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain clearance or approval for future products or new indications or uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarket reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns our diagnostic product facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities failure to comply with applicable rules could result in among other things substantial modifications to our business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of our products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability timely to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation revenues profitability or financial condition 

our efforts to develop commercially successful medical diagnostic products may not succeed 

we may commit substantial efforts funds and other resources to developing commercially successful medical diagnostic products a high rate of failure is inherent in the development of new medical diagnostic products there is no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point 

in the development process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals failure to achieve market adoption limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products changing customer preferences or changing industry standards innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our medical diagnostic products under development will be launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire products or whether any diagnostic products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees’ ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2013 we may be required to incur significant expense in implementing the new coding set and if we do not adequately implement it our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests 

in october 2010 the american medical association cpt editorial panel approved 27 new analyte specific codes and will consider additional codes in 2011 to describe several molecular genetic tests that currently require multiple cpt codes for billing purposes the new codes could replace the current codes for payers including medicare beginning january 1 2012 reimbursement levels for the new codes have yet to be determined if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic tests our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management’s attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 

this report also includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks or uncertainties our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks we face described below and elsewhere see “cautionary factors that may affect future results” on page 28 

continued weakness in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the economies of the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business continue to experience significant weakness which in the case of the us has resulted in significant unemployment and reduced economic activity continued weakness or a further decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products thus reducing our revenue these conditions also could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical test providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their 

medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position our failure to provide a broad test menu or service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and profitability could be damaged 

us healthcare reform legislation may result in significant changes and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare the legislation provides for reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 the legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories beginning in 2013 the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms including the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage fixed percentages on medical loss ratios expansion in medicaid and other programs employer mandates individual mandates creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations a new healthcare delivery model while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fda regulation of ldts and clinical laboratories may result in significant change and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt 

during 2010 the fda publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over ldts and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach the fda has indicated that it will use a riskbased approach to regulation and will direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation the fda has not announced a framework or timetable for implementing its new regulatory approach the regulatory approach adopted by the fda may lead to an increased regulatory burden including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests while the ultimate impact of the fda’s approach is unknown it may be extensive and may result in significant change our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis cms changes add to our costs by increasing complexity and administrative requirements for billing medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation is intended to control the growth of medicare advantage programs encourage beneficiaries to switch back to traditional medicare programs and expand the eligibility for 

traditional medicaid programs recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

healthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including healthcare plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these healthcare plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among healthcare plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer the 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges that may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as strategic acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that was previously operated independently and has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 21 

 if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

as noted above government payers and healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal and state enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business opportunities 

information technology “it” systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems we also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems nevertheless we may experience damages to our systems and system failures and interruptions 

in addition we are in the process of implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems which we expect will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for tests in a timely manner if our operations are interrupted it could 

adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and revenues 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests that may result in a decrease in the demand for our tests or cause us to reduce the prices of our tests our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients or the internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices although clia compliance costs make it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to both physicians and patients of test kits approved by the fda for pointofcare testing or home use development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our revenues 

some of our customers such as hospitals and physicians are internalizing tests that we currently perform including anatomic pathology tests if our customers continue to internalize tests that we currently perform and we do not develop new or alternative tests attractive to our customers the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our revenues may be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 30 billion of debt outstanding except for operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings there can be no 

assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in that case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists particularly those with subspecialties with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of clinical testing services including anatomic pathology services and related services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

the failure of our it systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 

public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology “hcit” standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including test orders and test results could require costly modifications to our existing hcit systems while we do not expect hcit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing hcit standards we could lose customers and business opportunities 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data or personal information if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our expanding international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in local jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

we expect to expand further our international operations through acquisition or otherwise which would increase these risks as a result of these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our medical diagnostic products business is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant diagnostics products 

our medical diagnostic products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states including the fda and by regulatory authorities outside the united states including the european commission the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market a medical diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and clearance or approval for future products is never certain securing regulatory clearance or approval of additional indications or uses of existing products is not predictable delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain clearance or approval for future products or new indications or uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarket reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns our diagnostic product facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities failure to comply with applicable rules could result in among other things substantial modifications to our business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of our products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability timely to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation revenues profitability or financial condition 

our efforts to develop commercially successful medical diagnostic products may not succeed 

we may commit substantial efforts funds and other resources to developing commercially successful medical diagnostic products a high rate of failure is inherent in the development of new medical diagnostic products there is no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point 

in the development process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals failure to achieve market adoption limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products changing customer preferences or changing industry standards innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our medical diagnostic products under development will be launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire products or whether any diagnostic products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees’ ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2013 we may be required to incur significant expense in implementing the new coding set and if we do not adequately implement it our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests 

in october 2010 the american medical association cpt editorial panel approved 27 new analyte specific codes and will consider additional codes in 2011 to describe several molecular genetic tests that currently require multiple cpt codes for billing purposes the new codes could replace the current codes for payers including medicare beginning january 1 2012 reimbursement levels for the new codes have yet to be determined if reimbursement levels for the new codes do not recognize the value of the molecular genetic tests our revenues and earnings could be adversely impacted 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management’s attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

 item 2 properties 

our executive offices are located in madison new jersey we maintain clinical testing laboratories in major metropolitan areas and elsewhere throughout the continental united states in several instances a joint venture of which we are a partner maintains the laboratory we also maintain offices data centers billing centers call centers an assembly center distribution centers patient service centers and a clinical trials testing laboratory at locations throughout the united states in addition we maintain offices manufacturing facilities patient service centers and clinical laboratories in locations outside the united states including in sweden puerto rico mexico the united kingdom india ireland and australia our properties that are not owned are leased on terms and for durations that are reflective of commercial standards in the communities where these properties are located we believe that in general our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated future levels of operation and are adequately maintained we believe that if we were unable to renew a lease on any of our facilities we could find alternative space at competitive market rates and relocate our operations to such new location without material disruption to our business several of our principal facilities are highlighted below 

 


 item 3 legal proceedings 

in addition to the matters described below in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a provider of diagnostic testing information and services these legal actions may include lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims these actions could involve claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages and could have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding our business including among other matters operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these reviews investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the healthcare services industry including our company 

we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims 

we contest liability or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations or proceedings are in the early stages we cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss if any related to such matters how or if such matters will be resolved when they ultimately will be resolved or what the eventual settlement fine penalty or other relief if any might be subject to the foregoing we believe based on current knowledge that the outcome of pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although the outcome of such matters could be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period that such matters are determined or paid 

in 2006 and 2008 the company and several of its subsidiaries received subpoenas from the california attorney general’s office seeking documents relating to the company’s billings to medical the california medicaid program the company cooperated with the government’s requests subsequently the state of california intervened as plaintiff in a civil lawsuit california ex rel hunter laboratories llc v quest diagnostics incorporated et al the 

“california lawsuit” filed in california superior court against a number of clinical laboratories including the company and several of its subsidiaries the complaint was originally filed by a competitor laboratory in california under the whistleblower provisions of the california false claims act the complaint was unsealed on march 20 2009 

the complaint alleges that among other things the company overcharged medical for testing services and violated the california false claims act violations of this statute and related regulations could lead to an injunction fines or penalties and exclusion from medical as well as claims by third parties 

in the third quarter of 2010 the california department of health care services the “department” conducted an audit of the company’s billing to medical the department contends that the company’s billings are not consistent with applicable california regulations as currently interpreted by the department while the company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with california requirements applicable to billing for clinical laboratory testing the company entered into an interim agreement under which it has agreed to temporarily suspend billing medical for a period of up to six months through march 1 2011 during which it continues to provide services if the california lawsuit is not resolved by march 1 2011 the company and the department have agreed to negotiate in good faith the terms of a further agreement the company has continued to recognize revenue from medical for services provided in accordance with its interpretation of california regulations related to billing for clinical laboratory testing an unfavorable outcome of the california lawsuit could among other consequences noted above result in reduced reimbursement from the medical program revenue from the medical program in 2010 was approximately 66 million at december 31 2010 amounts due from medical totaled approximately 25 million including those amounts related to services performed during the temporary suspension of billing under the interim agreement described above 

the company has been engaged in discussions in an attempt to resolve the matters described above during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company reached an understanding which was highly conditioned to settle these matters pursuant to which the company would pay 241 million conditions included but were not limited to reaching an agreement regarding the manner in which the company’s future billings would be treated by the department however as of this date the company has been unable to reach an agreement to settle these matters and no assurance can be given that an agreement will be reached if the company cannot resolve these matters through these discussions it will continue to vigorously defend itself and will pursue any available collateral actions to enforce its rights if necessary based on the current facts and circumstances a liability if any is not determinable at this time although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition the outcome may be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

in 2005 the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of inspector general seeking business records including records regarding the company’s relationship with health maintenance organizations independent physician associations group purchasing organizations and preferred provider organizations relating back to 1995 the company has cooperated with the investigation subsequently in november 2009 the us district court for the southern district of new york partially unsealed a civil complaint us ex rel fair laboratory practices associates v quest diagnostics incorporated filed against the company under the whistleblower provisions of the federal false claims act the complaint alleges among other things violations of the federal antikickback statute and the federal false claims act in connection with the company’s pricing of laboratory services the complaint seeks damages for alleged false claims associated with laboratory tests reimbursed by government payors treble damages and civil penalties 

in june 2009 a shareholder plaintiff filed a purported derivative action in the superior court of new jersey morris county on behalf of the company against certain present and former directors and officers of the company based on among other things their alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the manufacture marketing sale and billing related to certain test kits manufactured by nid the complaint includes claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and seeks among other things damages and remission of compensation received by the individual defendants the company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on june 30 2010 the motion was granted and the time for an appeal has expired 

in april 2010 a putative class action was filed against the company and nid in the us district court for the eastern district of new york on behalf of entities that allegedly purchased or paid for certain of nid’s test kits the complaint alleges that certain of nid’s test kits were defective and that defendants among other things violated rico and state consumer protection laws the complaint alleges an unspecified amount of damages 

in august 2010 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the superior court of new jersey morris county 

on behalf of the company against the directors and certain present officers of the company the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with among other things alleged overcharges by the company to medical for testing services and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and equitable relief 

in november 2010 a putative class action was filed against the company and certain present and former officers of the company in the superior court of new jersey essex county on behalf of the company’s sales people nationwide who were over forty years old and who either resigned or were terminated after being placed on a performance improvement plan the complaint alleges that the defendants’ conduct violates the new jersey law against discrimination and seeks among other things unspecified damages the defendants removed the complaint to the united states district court for the district of new jersey 

in addition the company and certain of its subsidiaries have received subpoenas from state agencies in five states and from the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services which seek documents relating to the company’s billing practices the company is cooperating with the requests 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on new theories as to the company’s practices which management believes to be in compliance with law in addition certain federal and state statutes including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers the company is aware of certain pending individual or class action lawsuits and has received several subpoenas related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act andor other federal and state statutes regulations or other laws the company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” as to which the company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability 

several of these matters are in their early stages of development and involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas while the company believes that at least a reasonable possibility exists that losses may have been incurred based on the nature and status of the investigations the losses are either currently not probable or a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries m anagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company 

quest diagnostics is the world’s leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services providing insights that enable patients physicians and others to make better healthcare decisions quest diagnostics with a leading position in most of its domestic geographic markets and service offerings is well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry over 90 of our revenues are derived from clinical testing with the balance derived from insurer services clinical trials testing diagnostic products and healthcare information technology clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services clinical laboratory testing is generally performed on whole blood serum plasma and other body fluids such as urine and specimens such as microbiology samples anatomic pathology services are principally for the detection of cancer and are performed on tissues such as biopsies and other samples such as human cells we are the leading cancer diagnostics testing provider focused on anatomic pathology and molecular diagnostics and provide interpretive consultation through the largest medical and scientific staff in the industry with approximately 900 mds and phds primarily located in the united states in addition we are the leading provider of genebased and esoteric testing and testing for drugsofabuse in the united states and the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry in north america we are also a leading provider of testing for clinical trials our diagnostics products business manufactures and markets diagnostic test kits and specialized pointofcare testing we also empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with robust information technology solutions that can improve patient care and medical practice 

the clinical testing industry 

clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions 

most laboratory tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories or physicianoffice laboratories in 2010 we estimate that hospitalaffiliated laboratories accounted for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

orders for laboratory testing are generated from physician offices hospitals and employers and can be affected by a number of factors for example changes in the united states economy can affect the number of unemployed and uninsured and design changes in healthcare plans can affect the number of physician office and hospital visits and can impact the utilization of laboratory testing 

while the economic slow down in the united states has temporarily reduced industry growth rates we believe the clinical testing industry will continue to grow over the long term because clinical testing is an essential healthcare service and because of the following key trends 

 the diagnostic testing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows typically testing volume declines during the summer months yearend holiday periods and other major holidays reducing net revenues and operating cash flows below annual averages testing volume is also subject to declines due to severe weather or other events which can deter patients from having testing performed and which can vary in duration and severity from year to year 

healthcare reform 

in march 2010 us federal legislation was enacted which is likely to have a significant impact on among other things access to and the cost of healthcare in the united states the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms and expands coverage for approximately 32 million previously uninsured americans which will result in expanded access to healthcare in addition the legislation eliminates patient costsharing for certain prevention and wellness benefits for health insurance plans that are not “grandfathered” we believe these changes will benefit our industry by leading to increased utilization of our services 

these benefits are expected to be partially offset by provisions of the legislation aimed at reducing the overall cost of healthcare impacting laboratories specifically the legislation provides for annual reductions in the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 175 for five years beginning in 2011 and includes a productivity adjustment which reduces the cpi market basket update beginning in 2011 in 2010 approximately 12 of our consolidated revenues were reimbursed by medicare under the clinical laboratory fee schedule the legislation also imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the united states including those purchased and used by laboratories beginning in 2013 

in addition the legislation is focused on reducing the growth of healthcare costs the legislation establishes the independent payment advisory board which will be responsible beginning in 2014 annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets further the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs 

we believe that the legislation will be a net positive for our industry over the long term due to expanded coverage and the elimination of patient costsharing for certain prevention and wellness benefits and that we are well positioned to respond to the evolving healthcare environment and related market forces however our failure to adapt to these changes could be detrimental to our business 

reimbursement for services 

payments for clinical testing services are made by physicians hospitals employers healthcare insurers patients and the government physicians hospitals and employers are typically billed on a feeforservice basis based on negotiated fee schedules fees billed to healthcare insurers and patients are based on the laboratory’s patient fee schedule subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the healthcare insurers or with physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid as well as healthcare insurers and larger employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical testing services in december 2010 congress delayed by one year a potential 30 decrease in the medicare fee schedule for pathology and other physician services performed for patients and billed under part b of the medicare program in 2010 approximately 3 of our consolidated revenues were reimbursed based on this fee schedule 

healthcare insurers which typically negotiate directly or indirectly on behalf of their members represent approximately onehalf of our clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from our clinical testing business larger healthcare insurers typically contract with large commercial clinical laboratories because they can provide services to their members on a national or regional basis in addition larger commercial clinical laboratories are better able to achieve the lowcost structures necessary to profitably service the members of large healthcare insurers and can provide test utilization data across various products in a consistent format in certain markets such as california healthcare insurers may delegate their covered members to independent physician associations which in turn negotiate with laboratories for clinical testing services on behalf of their members 

the trend of consolidation among physicians hospitals employers healthcare insurers and other intermediaries has continued resulting in fewer but larger customers and payers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories healthcare insurers often require that clinical testing service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the utilization risk associated with providing testing services to their members enrolled in highlyrestricted plans through capitated payment arrangements under these capitated payment arrangements we and the healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member enrolled in a restricted plan generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us our cost to perform testing services reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements is not materially different from our cost to perform testing services reimbursed under other arrangements with healthcare insurers since average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically less 

than our overall average reimbursement rate the testing services reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements are generally less profitable in 2010 we derived approximately 13 of our testing volume and 4 of our clinical testing net revenues from capitated payment arrangements 

most healthcare insurers also offer programs such as preferred provider organizations “ppos” and consumer driven health plans that offer a greater choice of healthcare providers pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements most of our agreements with major healthcare insurers are nonexclusive arrangements as a result under these nonexclusive arrangements physicians and patients have more freedom of choice in selecting laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on the basis of service and quality than they may otherwise it is increasingly important for healthcare providers to differentiate themselves based on quality service convenience and unique test offerings to avoid competing on price alone 

despite the general trend of increased choice for patients in selecting a healthcare provider some healthcare insurers may actively seek to limit the choice of patients and physicians if they feel it will give them increased leverage to negotiate lower fees by consolidating services with a single or limited network of contracted providers historically healthcare insurers which had limited their network of laboratory service providers encouraged their members and sometimes offered incentives to utilize only contracted providers patients who use a noncontracted provider may have a higher coinsurance responsibility which may result in physicians referring testing to contracted providers to minimize the expense to their patients in cases where members choose to use a noncontracted provider the noncontracted provider would be reimbursed at rates considered “reasonable and customary” contracted rates are generally lower than “reasonable and customary” rates 

we also may be a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers which provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we expect that reimbursements for the diagnostic testing industry will continue to remain under pressure today the federal and many state governments face serious budget deficits and healthcare spending is subject to reductions and efforts to reduce reimbursements and stringent cost controls by government and other payers for existing tests may continue however we believe that as new tests are developed which either improve on the effectiveness of existing tests or provide new diagnostic capabilities the government and other payers will add these tests as covered services because of the importance of laboratory testing in assessing and managing the health of patients we continue to emphasize the importance and the high value of laboratory testing with healthcare insurers and government payers at the federal and state level 

six sigma as a means to improve quality and operating efficiency 

the diagnostic testing industry is labor intensive employee compensation and benefits constitute approximately onehalf of our total costs and expenses cost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining transporting and testing specimens selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts billing operations including bad debt expense and general management and administrative support in addition performing diagnostic testing involves significant fixed costs for facilities and other infrastructure required to obtain transport and test specimens therefore relatively small changes in volume can have a significant impact on profitability in the shortterm 

we intend to become recognized as the quality leader in the healthcare services industry through utilizing the six sigma approach and lean six sigma principles six sigma is a management approach that enhances quality and requires a thorough understanding of customer needs and experience root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring of key metrics lean six sigma streamlines processes and eliminates waste we utilize the six sigma approach and lean six sigma principles to improve the quality and efficiency of our operations we use six sigma to deploy best practices and implement initiatives designed to reduce the cost of our operations and to provide a better customer experience we expect to continue deploying best practices and developing additional initiatives designed to further improve quality and the efficiency of our operations 

growth through acquisition 

the clinical testing industry in the united states remains fragmented and highly competitive we expect to grow through a combination of organic and acquired growth we expect to continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of domestic clinical laboratories both routine and esoteric that can be integrated into our existing laboratories thereby increasing access for patients and enabling us to reduce costs and improve efficiencies while over the long term we believe positive industry factors in the united states diagnostic testing industry and the differentiated services we offer to our customers will enable us to grow organically we believe there will continue to be opportunities to grow beyond our current principal business of offering clinical testing in the united states technology is enabling testing to be performed closer to the patient whether in the physician’s office or at the hospital bedside in the form of pointofcare testing given that physicians and hospitals are primary sources for both pointofcare testing and laboratory performed tests we believe providing both forms of testing will strengthen our relationships with customers and accelerate our growth 

additionally diagnostic testing in international markets particularly developing countries is highly fragmented and less mature continued expansion into pointofcare testing and international markets will diversify our revenue base and provide increased access to fast growing markets 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

while many operational aspects of our business are subject to complex federal state and local regulations the accounting for most of our business is generally straightforward with net revenues primarily recognized upon completion of the testing process our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions and about onehalf of our total costs and expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits due to the nature of our business several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates and judgments 

 the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our clinical testing business involves significant assumptions and judgments billings for services reimbursed by thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid are generally recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payers adjustments to the allowances based on actual receipts from the thirdparty payers are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenues 

we have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of our receivables based on a number of factors including the period they have been outstanding historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to revenues and allowances for doubtful accounts in addition we regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectibility of receivables or allowance estimates we believe that the collectibility of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide as such we have implemented “best practices” to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling general and administrative expenses we believe that our collection and allowance estimation processes along with our close monitoring of our billing operations help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates less than 5 of our net accounts receivable as of december 31 2010 were outstanding more than 150 days 

the following table shows current estimates of the percentage of our total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical testing business during 2010 applicable to each payer group 

   healthcare insurers 

  reimbursements from healthcare insurers represent approximately onehalf of our clinical testing net revenues reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated feeforservice schedules and on capitated payment rates 

receivables due from healthcare insurers represent approximately 27 of our clinical testing net accounts receivable substantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare insurers represent amounts billed under negotiated feeforservice arrangements we utilize a standard approach to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for such receivables which considers the aging of the receivables and results in increased allowance requirements as the aging of the related receivables increases our approach also considers historical collection experience and other factors collection of such receivables is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines for healthcare insurers collection typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing provided we have billed healthcare plans accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline there has historically been little to no collection risk if there has been a delay in billing we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline and if so we will reserve accordingly for the billing 

approximately 4 of our clinical testing net revenues are reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements in which case the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month services are performed essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at monthend if any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and if so would reserve accordingly 

government payers 

payments for clinical testing services made by the government are based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities receivables due from government payers under the medicare and medicaid programs represent approximately 18 of our clinical testing net accounts receivable collection of such receivables is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines collection typically occurs within 30 days of billing our processes for billing collecting and estimating uncollectible amounts for receivables due from government payers as well as the risk of noncollection are similar to those noted above for healthcare insurers under negotiated feeforservice arrangements see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding amounts due from medical 

client payers 

client payers include physicians hospitals employers and other commercial laboratories and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule receivables due from client payers represent approximately 33 of our clinical testing net accounts receivable credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers we utilize a standard approach to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for such receivables which considers the aging of the receivables and results in increased allowance requirements as the aging of the related receivables increase our approach also considers specific account reviews historical collection experience and other factors 

patient receivables 

patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers or physicians on behalf of their patients receivables due from patients represent approximately 22 

of our clinical testing net accounts receivable collection of receivables due from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay we utilize a standard approach to establish allowances for doubtful accounts for such receivables which considers the aging of the receivables and results in increased allowance requirements as the aging of the related receivables increases our approach also considers historical collection experience and other factors patient receivables are generally fully reserved for when the related billing reaches 210 days outstanding balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies reserves are adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience which is regularly monitored 

  reserves for general and professional liability claims 

as a general matter providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims these suits could involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims while the basis for claims reserves considers actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience the process of analyzing assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on our results of operations principally costs of services and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised or paid although we believe that our present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures it is possible that we may incur liabilities in excess of our recorded reserves or insurance coverage 

  reserves for other legal proceedings 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations including inspections and audits by governmental agencies in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we have in the past entered into several settlement agreements with various government and private payers relating to industrywide billing and marketing practices that had been substantially discontinued the federal or state governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our practices which management believes to be in compliance with law in addition certain federal and state statutes including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices we are aware of certain pending lawsuits including class action lawsuits and have received several subpoenas related to billing practices see notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that involve the company 

we have a comprehensive compliance program that is intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies management regularly reports to the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors regarding compliance operations as an integral part of our compliance program we investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments upon becoming aware of potential overpayments we consider all available facts and circumstances to estimate and record the amounts to be reimbursed while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate the government may not in each instance accept these actions as sufficient 

the process of analyzing assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment management has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles changes in facts and circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant revisions to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are revised or paid 

  accounting for and recoverability of goodwill 

we evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill annually the annual impairment test is a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any our estimate of 

fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company as well as i the financial projections and future prospects of our business including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements and ii comparable sales prices if available as part of the first step to assess potential impairment we compare our estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit we determine the fair value of the reporting units based on the income approach under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the book value is greater than our estimate of fair value we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment if any the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess we believe our estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices 

on a quarterly basis we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the company and its goodwill if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred we would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter consistent with the annual impairment test performed at the end of our fiscal year on december 31st and record any noted impairment loss 

  accounting for stockbased compensation expense 

we record stockbased compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards as such we recognize stockbased compensation cost only for those stockbased awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing stockbased compensation cost over their requisite service periods involves significant assumptions and judgments 

we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a latticebased optionvaluation model which requires management to make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of the company’s common stock ii dividend yield iii riskfree interest rates and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period the expected volatility under the latticebased optionvaluation model is based on the current and historical implied volatilities from traded options of our common stock the dividend yield is based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities ranging from one month to ten years the expected holding period of the awards granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees in addition we estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stockbased compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest we use historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from our estimates stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period we periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates as considered necessary the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision 

the terms of our performance share unit grants allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards for performance share unit awards the actual amount of any stock award earned is based on the compound annual growth rate of the company’s earnings per share from continuing operations over a threeyear period as measured in accordance with the provisions of the amended and restated quest diagnostics incorporated employee longterm incentive plan stockbased compensation expense associated with performance share units is recognized based on management’s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned if the actual number of performance share units earned is different from our estimates stockbased compensation could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision while the assumptions used to calculate and account for stockbased compensation awards represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if revisions are made to our assumptions and estimates our stockbased compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period in addition the number of awards made under our equity compensation plans changes in the design of those plans the price of our shares and the performance of our company can all cause stockbased compensation expense to vary from period to period 

results of operations 

our clinical testing business currently represents our one reportable business segment the clinical testing business for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 accounted for more than 90 of net revenues from continuing operations our other operating segments consist of our risk assessment services clinical trials testing healthcare information technology and diagnostic products businesses on april 19 2006 we decided to discontinue the operations of a test kit manufacturing subsidiary nid during the third quarter of 2006 we completed the wind down of nid therefore the operations of nid are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented our business segment information is disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  year ended december 31 2010 compared with year ended december 31 2009 

continuing operations 

 results for the year ended december 31 2010 reflect lower revenues compared to the prior year which has served to reduce income from continuing operations below the prior year level actions we have taken to adjust our cost structure reduced costs for performancebased compensation improved experience associated with professional liability claims and continued progress in reducing bad debt expense have served to partially mitigate the impact to earnings from lower revenues lower outstanding share counts resulting from share repurchases contributed 023 to the earnings per share improvement 

results for the year ended december 31 2010 include 270 million of pretax charges or 009 per share principally associated with workforce reductions in the first and fourth quarters of these costs 64 million and 206 million respectively were included in cost of services and selling general and administrative expenses results for the year ended december 31 2010 also include a 96 million fourth quarter pretax charge or 003 per share associated with the settlement of employee litigation and a benefit of 012 per share primarily associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies in addition we estimate that the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 adversely affected the full year comparison of operating income to the prior year by 143 million or 005 per share 

results for the year ended december 31 2009 include pretax charges of 204 million or 007 per share associated with the early extinguishment of debt and 70 million or 002 per share associated with the writedown of an investment these charges were offset by a 155 million gain or 005 per share associated with an insurance settlement for stormrelated losses and a benefit of 004 per share resulting from certain discrete tax benefits 

net revenues 

the decrease in net revenues from the prior year was principally related to lower revenues from our clinical testing business for the year ended december 31 2010 revenues from our clinical testing business which accounts for over 90 of our net revenues were 13 below the prior year level 

clinical testing volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 10 we believe that clinical testing volume was adversely affected by a general slowdown in physician office visits compared to the prior year and severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 published survey data estimates that physician office visits declined approximately 5 in 2010 compared to 2009 

revenue per requisition decreased 02 for the year ended december 31 2010 revenue per requisition benefitted from an increased mix of genebased and esoteric testing and an increase in the number of tests ordered per requisition offsetting these benefits were a 19 medicare fee schedule decrease which went into effect on january 1 2010 and served to reduce revenue per requisition by 04 business and payer mix changes including an increase in lower priced drugsofabuse testing and a decrease in higher priced anatomic pathology testing and pricing changes in connection with several large contract extensions entered into in 2009 and in the first half of 2010 

our businesses other than clinical laboratory testing accounted for approximately 9 of our net revenues in 2010 and 2009 these businesses contain most of our international operations and include our risk assessment services clinical trials testing healthcare information technology and diagnostic products businesses for the year ended december 31 2010 aggregate revenues for these businesses approximated the prior year level 

operating costs and expenses 

 total operating costs and expenses 

lower revenues in our clinical testing business including the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 and charges associated with actions we have taken to adjust our cost structure partially offset by reduced costs for performancebased compensation improved experience associated with professional liability claims and continued progress in reducing bad debt expense served to increase total operating costs as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 270 million of pretax charges principally associated with workforce reductions of which 64 million was recorded in cost of services and 206 million was recorded in selling general and administrative expenses operating costs for the year ended december 31 2010 also included a 96 million fourth quarter charge associated with the settlement of employee litigation 

operating costs for the year ended december 31 2009 included a 155 million gain related to an insurance settlement for storm related losses which served to decrease total operating costs as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 

also yearoveryear comparisons for the year ended december 31 2010 were favorably impacted by 27 million associated with gains and losses on investments in our supplemental deferred compensation plans the impact can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on investment performance under our supplemental deferred compensation plans employee compensation deferrals together with company matching contributions are invested in a variety of investments held in trusts gains and losses associated with the investments are recorded in earnings within other income expense net a corresponding and offsetting adjustment is also recorded to the deferred compensation obligation to reflect investment gains and losses earned by employees such adjustments to the deferred compensation obligation are recorded in earnings principally within selling general and administrative expenses and offset the amount of investment gains and losses recorded in other income expense net results for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 included increases in operating costs of 57 and 84 million respectively representing increases in the deferred compensation obligation to reflect investment gains earned by employees participating in our deferred compensation plans 

  cost of services 

cost of services includes the costs of obtaining transporting and testing specimens for the year ended december 31 2010 cost of services increased as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of lower revenues in our clinical testing business including the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 and charges associated with workforce reductions in response to lower testing volume partially offset by actions taken to reduce our cost structure reduced performancebased compensation and improved experience associated with professional liability claims 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include the costs of the sales force billing operations bad debt expense and general management and administrative support for the year ended december 31 2010 selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from prior year primarily as a result of reduced bad debt expense in addition activities in 2010 to adjust our cost structure in response to lower testing volume and reduced performancebased compensation partially offset by charges principally associated with workforce reductions reduced selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues continued progress in our billing and collection processes has resulted in improvements in bad debt and the cost of our billing operation 

  other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities and for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following 

   operating income 

 operating income for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased as a percentage of net revenues from the prior year primarily as a result of the impact of lower revenues in our clinical testing business including the estimated impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 charges associated with workforce reductions and employee litigation partially offset by actions taken to adjust our cost structure reduced cost of performancebased compensation improved experience associated with professional liability claims and lower bad debt expense the estimated impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2010 combined with charges associated with actions we have taken to adjust our cost structure and the settlement of employee litigation adversely impacted the yearoveryear change in operating income as a percentage of net revenues by 07 compared to the prior year in addition the yearoveryear change in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was also adversely impacted by 02 associated with a 155 million gain recorded in 2009 related to an insurance settlement for stormrelated losses 

  interest expense net 

 interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 increased from the prior year primarily due to higher average outstanding debt in 2010 compared to the prior year 

  other income expense net 

other income expense net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to nonoperating activities such as gains and losses associated with investments and other nonoperating assets and losses on the early extinguishment of debt for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 other income expense net consisted of the following 

   income tax expense 

 the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in income from continuing operations before income taxes of 436 million and a decrease in the effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies results for the year ended december 31 2010 included 221 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies results for the year ended december 31 2009 included 70 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with certain discrete tax benefits 

  discontinued operations 

loss from discontinued operations net of taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 was 18 million or 001 per diluted share compared to 12 million or 001 per diluted share in 2009 on april 15 2009 the company entered into a final settlement agreement with the federal government and paid 308 million which had been previously reserved in connection with the final settlement see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details

 the increase in income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2009 from the prior year was principally driven by improved operating performance and lower interest expense results for the year ended december 31 2009 include pretax charges of 204 million or 007 per share associated with the early extinguishment of debt and 70 million or 002 per share associated with the writedown of an investment these charges were offset by a 155 million gain or 005 per share associated with an insurance settlement for storm 

related losses and a benefit of 004 per share resulting from certain discrete tax benefits 

results for the year ended december 31 2008 include a third quarter charge of 89 million or 003 per share associated with the writedown of an equity investment and pretax charges of 162 million or 005 per share primarily associated with workforce reductions these charges were offset by favorable resolutions of various tax contingencies in 2008 which increased earnings per share by 008 in addition we estimate the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter of 2008 adversely impacted operating income for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 8 million or 002 per share 

  net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 grew by 28 over the prior year level to 75 billion changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2009 by 04 

for 2009 revenues of our clinical testing business which accounts for over 90 of our net revenues grew 32 above the prior year level declines in preemployment drug testing which is part of our clinical testing business reduced consolidated revenues by 07 

clinical testing volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 07 for the year ended december 31 2009 preemployment drug testing volume which accounted for approximately 5 of our total clinical testing volume in 2009 declined approximately 22 and reduced consolidated volume by 15 we believe the volume decrease in preemployment drug testing continued to be principally due to reduced hiring by employers served by this business our decision to exit certain laboratory management agreements that did not meet our profitability thresholds also reduced volume by 04 

revenue per requisition increased 39 for the year ended december 31 2009 with the increase primarily driven by a positive test mix and a 45 increase in the medicare laboratory fee schedule which went into effect january 1 2009 and contributed approximately a onehalf percent increase in revenue per requisition 

our businesses other than clinical testing accounted for approximately 8 of our net revenues in 2009 these businesses include our risk assessment services clinical trials testing healthcare information technology and diagnostic products businesses these businesses contain most of our international operations and in the aggregate reported revenues for 2009 were comparable to the prior year level despite the impact of foreign exchange which reduced the combined revenues of these businesses by approximately 4 

  operating costs and expenses 

   total operating costs and expenses 

total operating costs and expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from the prior year and decreased as a percentage of net revenues due to actions we have taken to improve our operating efficiency and reduce the size of our workforce along with discrete cost containment actions taken during 2009 which have enabled us to realize modest cost increases on increased net revenues these efforts coupled with higher revenue per requisition served to reduce operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenues in addition results for the year ended december 31 2009 include a 155 million second quarter gain related to an insurance settlement for stormrelated losses while results for the year ended december 31 2008 include fourth quarter charges of 162 million primarily associated with workforce reductions 77 million included in cost of services and 85 million included in selling 

general and administrative 

also yearoveryear comparisons were adversely impacted by approximately 18 million associated with gains and losses on investments in our supplemental deferred compensation plans the impact can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on investment performance under our supplemental deferred compensation plans employee compensation deferrals together with company matching contributions are invested in a variety of participantdirected investments held in trusts gains and losses associated with the investments are recorded in earnings within other income expense net a corresponding and offsetting adjustment is also recorded to the deferred compensation obligation to reflect investment gains and losses earned by employees such adjustments to the deferred compensation obligation are recorded in earnings principally within selling general and administrative expenses and offset the amount of investment gains and losses recorded in other income expense net results for 2009 included an increase in operating costs of 84 million representing an increase in the deferred compensation obligation to reflect investment gains earned by employees participating in our deferred compensation plans results for 2008 included a reduction in operating costs of 99 million representing a decrease in the deferred compensation obligation to reflect investment losses incurred by employees participating in our deferred compensation plans 

  cost of services 

cost of services decreased as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the prior year due to actions taken to reduce our cost structure and higher revenue per requisition 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to prior year primarily due to actions taken to reduce our cost structure and higher revenue per requisition in addition yearoveryear comparisons of selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were adversely impacted by 02 associated with investment gains and losses earned by employees on assets held in trust under our supplemental deferred compensation plans discussed earlier days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days at december 31 2009 compared to 44 days at december 31 2008 continued progress in our billing and collection processes has resulted in stable bad debt and improvements in days sales outstanding and the cost of our billing operations 

  other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities and for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following 

   operating income 

 the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher revenue per requisition and progress we are making with our cost reduction program as well as discrete cost containment actions we took during 2009 operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 also includes a 155 million gain associated with an insurance settlement for stormrelated losses which contributed 02 to the improvement the operating income percentage for the year ended december 31 2009 also reflects the impact of the various items which served to reduce cost of services and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues results for the year ended december 31 2008 

include a charge of 162 million primarily associated with workforce reductions which reduced operating income as a percentage of net revenues by 02 in addition yearoveryear comparisons were adversely impacted by approximately 18 million or 02 associated with investment gains and losses earned by employees on assets held in trust under our supplemental deferred compensation plans 

  interest expense net 

 the decrease in interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower interest rates on our variableinterest rate debt 

  other income expense net 

other income expense net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to nonoperating activities such as gains and losses associated with investments and other nonoperating assets and losses on the early extinguishment of debt for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 other income expense net consisted of the following 

   income tax expense 

 the increase in income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of 1773 million and an increase in the effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies reflected in the effective income tax rate for 2008 results for the year ended december 31 2009 included 70 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with certain discrete tax benefits results for the year ended december 31 2008 included 165 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies 

  discontinued operations 

loss from discontinued operations net of taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 was 12 million or 001 per diluted share compared to 51 million or 026 per diluted share in 2008 during the third quarter of 2008 the company and nid reached an agreement in principle to settle the previously disclosed federal government investigation of nid a test kit subsidiary voluntarily closed in 2006 as a result of the agreement in principle during 2008 the company recorded charges of 75 million in discontinued operations to increase its reserves for the settlement and related matters on april 15 2009 the company entered into a final settlement agreement with the federal government and paid 308 million which had been previously reserved in connection with the final settlement see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we address our exposure to market risks principally the market risk of changes in interest rates through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes we believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodities prices are not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our financial instruments and hedging activities 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately 31 billion and 33 billion respectively using quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments at december 31 2010 and 2009 the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by 80 million and 151 million respectively a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates representing 45 basis points and 46 basis points at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately 89 million and 96 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our secured receivables credit facility and our term loan due may 2012 are subject to variable interest rates interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on rates that are intended to approximate commercial paper rates for highlyrated issuers interest rates on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan due may 2012 are subject to a pricing schedule that can fluctuate based on changes in our credit ratings as such our borrowing cost under these credit arrangements will be subject to both fluctuations in interest rates and changes in our credit ratings as of december 31 2010 the borrowing rates under these credit facilities were for our secured receivables credit facility 116 for our senior unsecured credit facility libor plus 040 and for our term loan due may 2012 libor plus 040 at december 31 2010 the weighted average libor was 026 at december 31 2010 there was 742 million outstanding under our term loan due may 2012 and no borrowings outstanding under our 750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility or our 525 million secured receivables credit facility 

we seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt obligations in order to achieve this objective we have entered into interest rate swaps interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 

in november 2009 the company entered into various fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our 475 senior notes due 2020 to variableinterest rate debt based on libor plus 133 at december 31 2010 the interest rate swap agreements which expire in january 2020 have a notional amount totaling 350 million the fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding 475 senior notes due 2020 based on our net exposure to interest rate changes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness representing 3 basis points would impact annual interest expense by approximately 03 million assuming no changes to the debt outstanding at december 31 2010 

the fair value of the fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2010 was an asset of 105 million a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates representing 30 basis points would potentially change the fair value of the asset of these instruments by approximately 9 million 

for details regarding our outstanding debt and our financial instruments see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  risk associated with investment portfolio 

our investment portfolio includes equity investments in publicly held companies that are classified as availableforsale securities and other strategic equity holdings in privately held companies these securities are exposed to price fluctuations and are generally concentrated in the life sciences industry the carrying values of our availableforsale equity securities and privately held securities were 176 million at december 31 2010 

we regularly evaluate the fair value measurements of our equity investments to determine if losses in value are other than temporary and if an impairment loss has been incurred the evaluation considers if the security has the ability to recover and if so the estimated recovery period other factors that are considered in this evaluation include the amount of the otherthantemporary decline and its duration the issuer’s financial condition and shortterm prospects and whether the market decline was caused by overall economic conditions or conditions specific to the individual security 

we do not hedge our equity price risk the impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on among other things the enterprises’ ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers or private sales 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2010 totaled 449 million compared to 534 million at december 31 2009 cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2010 cash flows from operating activities of 11 billion together with cash onhand were used to fund investing and financing activities of 217 million and 986 million respectively cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2009 totaled 534 million compared to 254 million at december 31 2008 cash flows from operating activities in 2009 of 10 billion were used to fund investing and financing activities of 196 million and 521 million respectively

dividends 

during each of the quarters of 2010 and 2009 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 010 per common share we expect to fund future dividend payments with cash flows from operations and do not expect the dividend to have a material impact on our ability to finance future growth 

share repurchases 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we repurchased 147 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 5104 per share for 750 million including 45 million shares purchased in the first quarter at an average price of 5621 per share for 251 million under an accelerated share repurchase transaction with a bank for the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 10 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 4983 per share for 500 million including 45 million shares repurchased from sb holdings capital inc a whollyowned subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc “gsk” at an average price of 4433 per share for 200 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we reissued 21 million shares and 30 million shares respectively for employee benefit plans since the inception of our share repurchase program in may 2003 we have repurchased approximately 74 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 4713 for 35 billion at december 31 2010 250 million of our share repurchase authorization remained available in january 2011 our board of directors authorized 750 million of additional share repurchases bringing the total available under share repurchase authorizations which have no set expiration or termination date to 1 billion

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 interest payments on our longterm debt have been calculated after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements using the interest rates as of december 31 2010 applied to the december 31 2010 balances which are assumed to remain outstanding through their maturity dates 

a full description of the terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements and our future payments under certain of our contractual obligations is contained in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements a full discussion and analysis regarding our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases and noncancelable commitments to purchase product or services at december 31 2010 is contained in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2010 our total liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits were approximately 152 million which were excluded from the table above we believe it is reasonably possible that these liabilities may decrease by up to 14 million within the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations settlements andor the conclusion of tax examinations on certain tax positions for the remainder we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of the future payments of these liabilities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our contingent tax liability reserves 

our credit agreements and our term loan due may 2012 contain various covenants and conditions including the maintenance of certain financial ratios that could impact our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the various financial covenants included in our credit agreements and we do not expect these covenants to adversely impact our ability to execute our growth strategy or conduct normal business operations 

unconsolidated joint ventures 

we have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in phoenix arizona indianapolis indiana and dayton ohio which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting we believe that our transactions with our joint ventures are conducted at arm’s length reflecting current market conditions and pricing total net revenues of our unconsolidated joint ventures equal less than 6 of our consolidated net revenues total assets associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures are less than 2 of our consolidated total assets we have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to or in support of our unconsolidated joint ventures and their operations 

requirements and capital resources 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 220 million during 2011 for capital expenditures including assets under capitalized leases to support and expand our existing operations principally related to investments in information technology equipment and facility upgrades 

as of december 31 2010 13 billion of borrowing capacity was available under our existing credit facilities consisting of 525 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and 750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility after funding the repurchase which closed on february 4 2011 700 million of borrowing capacity was available under our existing credit facilities consisting of 25 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and 675 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit 

facility 

we believe the banks participating in our various credit facilities are predominantly highlyrated banks and that the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities described above is currently available to us should one or several banks no longer participate in either of our credit facilities we would not expect it to impact our ability to fund operations we expect that we will be able to replace our existing secured receivable credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility with alternative arrangements prior to their expiration 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents onhand and cash from operations together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet seasonal working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures debt service requirements and other obligations cash dividends on common shares share repurchases and additional growth opportunities for the foreseeable future we believe that our credit profile should provide us with access to additional financing if necessary to fund growth opportunities that cannot be funded from existing sources 

outlook 

as discussed in the overview despite the continued consolidation among healthcare insurers and their continued efforts to reduce reimbursement for providers of diagnostic testing and the general economic conditions we believe that the underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry will continue to improve and that over the longterm the industry will continue to grow as the world’s leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the growth expected in our industry 

we believe our focus on delivering a superior patient experience and six sigma quality as well as the investments we are making in sales service science and information technology will further differentiate us over the longterm and strengthen our industry leadership position in addition we plan to leverage our knowledge and expertise in diagnostic testing to further expand into international markets and pointofcare testing 

our strong cash generation exisiting credit facilities and access to additional financing position us well to take advantage of these growth opportunities 

inflation 

we believe that inflation generally does not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition because the majority of our contracts are short term 

impact of new accounting standards

 principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of any variable interest entities where the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both the company assesses the requirements related to the consolidation of variable interest entities “vies” including a qualitative assessment of power and economics that considers which entity has the power to direct the activities that “most significantly impact” the vie’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie the company’s relationships with variable interest entities were not material at both december 31 2010 and 2009 investments in entities which the company does not control but in which it has a substantial ownership interest generally between 20 and 49 and can exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the company’s investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled 449 million and 463 million respectively the company’s share of equity earnings from investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method totaled 296 million 332 million and 297 million respectively for 2010 2009 and 2008 all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

basis of presentation 

during the third quarter of 2006 the company completed its winddown of nid a test kit manufacturing subsidiary and classified the operations of nid as discontinued operations the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures have been prepared to report the results of nid as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 16 for a further discussion of discontinued operations 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year’s presentation 

use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

revenue recognition 

the company primarily recognizes revenue for services rendered upon completion of the testing process billings for services reimbursed by thirdparty payers including medicare and medicaid are recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payers adjustments to the allowances based on actual receipts from the thirdparty payers are recorded upon settlement approximately 18 of the company’s consolidated net revenues were generated by billings to the medicare and medicaid programs in each of the years ending december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 under capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers the company recognizes revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer’s health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by the company in 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 4 4 and 5 respectively of the company’s consolidated net revenues were generated under capitated arrangements 

revenues from the company’s risk assessment services clinical trials testing and diagnostics products businesses are recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price of the product or service is fixed or determinable and collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured the company’s healthcare information technology business primarily uses the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting and recognizes revenue as performance takes place over an extended period of time 

taxes on income 

the company uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 

earnings per share 

the company’s unvested restricted common stock and unvested restricted stock units that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and therefore are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the twoclass method for all periods presented basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and performance share units granted under the company’s amended and restated employee longterm incentive plan “eltip” and its amended and restated nonemployee director longterm incentive plan “dltip” 

stockbased compensation 

the company records stockbased compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards as such the company recognizes stockbased compensation cost only for those stockbased awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision the terms of the company’s performance share unit grants allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards for performance share unit awards the actual amount of any stock award earned is based on the compound annual growth rate of the company’s earnings per share from continuing operations over a threeyear period as measured in accordance with the eltip stockbased compensation expense associated with performance share units is recognized based on management’s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned the cumulative effect on current and prior

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense related to the company’s amended employee stock purchase plan “espp” based on the 15 discount at purchase see note 13 for a further discussion of stockbased compensation 

fair value measurements 

the company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market the principal market is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability absent a principal market to measure fair value the company has used the most advantageous market which is the market in which the company would receive the highest selling price for the asset or pay the lowest price to settle the liability after considering transaction costs however when using the most advantageous market transaction costs are only considered to determine which market is the most advantageous and these costs are then excluded when applying a fair value measurement 

inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a threelevel hierarchy the basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with level 1 having the highest priority and level 3 having the lowest 

 foreign currency 

the company predominately uses the us dollar as its functional currency the functional currency of the company’s foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency assets and liabilities denominated in nonus dollars are translated into us dollars at exchange rates as of the end of the reporting period income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year the translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included within other operating expense income net in the consolidated statements of operations transaction gains and losses have not been material for a discussion of the company’s use of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure for changes in foreign currency rates refer to the caption entitled “ derivative financial instruments – foreign currency risk ” below 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents include all highlyliquid investments with original maturities at the time acquired by the company of three months or less 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments the company’s policy is to place its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in highlyrated financial instruments and institutions concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the company’s payers and their dispersion across many different geographic regions and is limited to certain payers who are large buyers of the company’s services to reduce risk the company routinely assesses the financial strength of these payers and consequently believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure with respect to these payers is limited while the company has receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies the company does not 

f8 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal and state governments and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation as of december 31 2010 and 2009 receivables due from government payers under the medicare and medicaid programs represent approximately 16 and 12 respectively of the company’s consolidated net accounts receivable see note 15 for a discussion regarding certain amounts due from medical the california medicaid program the portion of the company’s accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk at both december 31 2010 and 2009 receivables due from patients represent approximately 19 of the company’s consolidated net accounts receivable the company applies assumptions and judgments including historical collection experience for assessing collectibility and determining allowances for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable from patients 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

accounts receivable are reported at realizable value net of allowances for doubtful accounts which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded the company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on a number of factors including the period they have been outstanding historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts in addition the company regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectibility of these receivables or reserve estimates revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling general and administrative expenses receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are writtenoff recoveries of receivables previously writtenoff are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

inventories which consist principally of testing supplies and reagents are valued at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment is recorded at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internaluse software payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internaluse software project and interest costs incurred when material while developing internaluse software capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose certain costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the expected useful lives of the assets depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over expected useful asset lives as follows buildings and improvements ranging from ten to thirty years laboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures ranging from three to seven years leasehold improvements the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or lease as applicable and computer software developed or obtained for internal use ranging from three to seven years 

goodwill 

goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of assets acquired including separately recognized intangible assets less the fair value of liabilities assumed in a business combination on january 1 2009 the company adopted a new accounting standard related to business combinations using the acquisition method goodwill arising from acquisitions completed on or after january 1 2009 represents the excess of the fair value of the acquiree including the fair value of noncontrolling interests over the recognized bases of the net identifiable assets acquired the company uses a nonamortization approach to account for goodwill arising from acquisitions goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically reviewed for impairment 

f9 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

intangible assets 

intangible assets are recognized at fair value as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable intangible assets principally representing the cost of customer relationships customer lists and noncompetition agreements acquired are capitalized and amortized on the straightline method over their expected useful life which generally ranges from five to twenty years intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consisting principally of acquired tradenames are not amortized but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment 

recoverability and impairment of goodwill 

the company reviews goodwill and certain intangible assets periodically for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value the goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment the annual impairment test of goodwill was performed at the end of each of the company’s fiscal years and indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december 31 2010 or 2009 

the annual impairment test is a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any management’s estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as i the financial projections and future prospects of the company’s business including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements and ii comparable sales prices if available as part of the first step to assess potential impairment management compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit if the book value is greater than the estimate of fair value the company would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment if any the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess management believes its estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 

on a quarterly basis management performs a review of the company’s business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the company and its goodwill if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred the company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter consistent with the annual impairment test and record any noted impairment loss 

recoverability and impairment of intangible assets and other longlived assets 

the company reviews the recoverability of its longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable evaluation of possible impairment is based on the company’s ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset 

investments 

the company accounts for investments in trading and availableforsale equity securities which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value both realized and unrealized gains and losses for trading securities are recorded currently in earnings as a component of nonoperating expenses within other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations unrealized gains and losses net of tax for availableforsale securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity 

f10 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

recognized gains and losses for availableforsale securities are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations gains and losses on securities sold are based on the average cost method 

the company periodically reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the primary factors considered in the determination are the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below carrying value the financial condition operating performance and near term prospects of the investee and the company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value if the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value 

investments at december 31 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following 

 investments in availableforsale equity securities consist of equity securities in public corporations investments in trading equity securities represent participantdirected investments of deferred employee compensation and related company matching contributions held in a trust pursuant to the company’s supplemental deferred compensation plan see note 13 the company purchases life insurance policies with the company named as beneficiary of the policies for the purpose of funding a nonqualified deferred compensation program changes in the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments other investments do not have readily determinable fair values and consist of investments in preferred and common shares of privately held companies and are accounted for under the cost method 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the company had no gross unrealized losses from availableforsale equity securities for the year ended december 31 2009 other income expense net within the consolidated statements of operations includes 78 million of charges principally associated with the writedown of an investment accounted for under the cost method for the year ended december 31 2008 other income expense net includes 89 million of charges associated with the writedown of availableforsale equity securities for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 gains losses from trading equity securities totaled 33 million 60 million and 99 million respectively and are included in other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 gains from changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies totaled 24 million and 24 million respectively and are included in other income expense net

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its debt obligations interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change however due to their relatively short maturities the company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material the company’s debt obligations consist of fixedrate and variablerate debt instruments the company’s primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within 

f11 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

an acceptable range in order to achieve these objectives the company has entered into interest rate swaps interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts net settlements between the counterparties are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 

the company formally documents its hedge relationships including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction on the date the derivative is entered into the company designates the type of derivative as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge and accounts for the derivative in accordance with its designation as prescribed by the standards on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities at inception and at least quarterly thereafter the company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item all components of each derivative financial instrument’s gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 

the company accounts for its derivatives as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value the fair value is based upon quoted market prices obtained from thirdparty financial institutions and includes an adjustment for the credit risk of the obligor’s nonperformance for a derivative instrument that has been formally designated as a fair value hedge fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in earnings together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged for derivatives that have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recorded in earnings upon maturity or early termination of an effective interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period the company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are classified into earnings immediately 

foreign currency risk 

the company is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates primarily under certain intercompany receivables and payables foreign exchange forward contracts are used to mitigate the exposure of the eventual net cash inflows or outflows resulting from these intercompany transactions the objective is to hedge a portion of the forecasted foreign currency risk over a rolling 12month time horizon to mitigate the eventual impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates on the cash flows of the intercompany transactions as of december 31 2010 the total notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts in us dollars was 559 million and principally consist of contracts in swedish krona and british pounds notional amounts represent the face amount of contractual arrangements and the basis on which currencies are exchanged and are not a measure of market or credit risk exposure the company does not designate these derivative instruments as hedges under current accounting standards unless the benefits of doing so are material the company’s foreign exchange exposure is not material to the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations the company does not hedge its net investment in nonus subsidiaries because it views those investments as longterm in nature 

comprehensive income loss

4 fair value measurements 

the following tables provide summaries of the recognized assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

 the company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a supplemental deferred compensation plan a participant’s deferrals together with company matching credits are invested in a variety of participantdirected stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held exclusive of any transaction costs a corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation the deferred compensation liabilities are classified within level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the trading securities 

f15 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

the company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation program a participant’s deferrals together with company matching credits are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator the company purchases life insurance policies with the company named as beneficiary of the policies for the purpose of funding the program’s liability changes in the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units the cash surrender value and the deferred compensation obligations are classified within level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments 

  the fair value measurements of foreign currency forward contracts are obtained from a thirdparty pricing service and are based on market prices in actual transactions and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the fair value measurements of the company’s interest rate swaps are modelderived valuations as of a given date in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past present and future market conditions the company does not believe that the changes in the fair values of its foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps will materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on its results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

investments in availableforsale equity securities consist of the revaluation of an existing investment in unregistered common shares of a publiclyheld company this investment is classified within level 3 because the unregistered securities contain restrictions on their sale and therefore the fair value measurement reflects a discount for the effect of the restriction 

in the second quarter of 2009 the company recorded a charge of 70 million associated with the writedown of an investment due to the uncertainty of recoverability from an otherthantemporary impairment loss a fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs has been applied to this asset on a nonrecurring basis 

the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments at december 31 2010 and 2009 the fair value of the company’s debt was estimated at approximately 31 billion and 33 billion respectively using quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments at december 31 2010 and 2009 the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by 80 million and 151 million respectively

  contingent lease obligations

f31 

quest diagnostics incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – continued dollars in thousands unless otherwise indicated 

under the leases cannot be precisely determined but are likely to total several hundred million dollars a claim against the company would be made only upon the current lessee’s default and after a series of claims and corresponding defaults by third parties that precede the company in the order of liability the company also has certain indemnification rights from other parties to recover losses in the event of default on the lease obligations the company believes that the likelihood of its performance under these contingent obligations is remote and no liability has been recorded for any potential payments under the contingent lease obligations 

  legal matters 

the company is involved in various legal proceedings some of the proceedings against the company involve claims that are substantial in amount 

in 2006 and 2008 the company and several of its subsidiaries received subpoenas from the california attorney general’s office seeking documents relating to the company’s billings to medical the california medicaid program the company cooperated with the government’s requests subsequently the state of california intervened as plaintiff in a civil lawsuit california ex rel hunter laboratories llc v quest diagnostics incorporated et al the “california lawsuit” filed in california superior court against a number of clinical laboratories including the company and several of its subsidiaries the complaint was originally filed by a competitor laboratory in california under the whistleblower provisions of the california false claims act the complaint was unsealed on march 20 2009 

the complaint alleges that among other things the company overcharged medical for testing services and violated the california false claims act violations of this statute and related regulations could lead to an injunction fines or penalties and exclusion from medical as well as claims by third parties 

in the third quarter of 2010 the california department of health care services the “department” conducted an audit of the company’s billing to medical the department contends that the company’s billings are not consistent with applicable california regulations as currently interpreted by the department while the company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with california requirements applicable to billing for clinical laboratory testing the company entered into an interim agreement under which it has agreed to temporarily suspend billing medical for a period of up to six months through march 1 2011 during which it continues to provide services if the california lawsuit is not resolved by march 1 2011 the company and the department have agreed to negotiate in good faith the terms of a further agreement the company has continued to recognize revenue from medical for services provided in accordance with its interpretation of california regulations related to billing for clinical laboratory testing an unfavorable outcome of the california lawsuit could among other consequences noted above result in reduced reimbursement from the medical program revenue from the medical program in 2010 was approximately 66 million at december 31 2010 amounts due from medical totaled approximately 25 million including those amounts related to services performed during the temporary suspension of billing under the interim agreement described above 

the company has been engaged in discussions in an attempt to resolve the matters described above during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company reached an understanding which was highly conditioned to settle these matters pursuant to which the company would pay 241 million conditions included but were not limited to reaching an agreement regarding the manner in which the company’s future billings would be treated by the department however as of this date the company has been unable to reach an agreement to settle these matters and no assurance can be given that an agreement will be reached if the company cannot resolve these matters through these discussions it will continue to vigorously defend itself and will pursue any available collateral actions to enforce its rights if necessary based on the current facts and circumstances a liability if any is not determinable at this time although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition the outcome may be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

in 2005 the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of inspector general seeking business records including records regarding the company’s relationship with health maintenance organizations independent physician associations group purchasing organizations and preferred provider

organizations relating back to 1995 the company has cooperated with the investigation subsequently in november 2009 the us district court for the southern district of new york partially unsealed a civil complaint us ex rel fair laboratory practices associates v quest diagnostics incorporated filed against the company under the whistleblower provisions of the federal false claims act the complaint alleges among other things violations of the federal antikickback statute and the federal false claims act in connection with the company’s pricing of laboratory services the complaint seeks damages for alleged false claims associated with laboratory tests reimbursed by government payors treble damages and civil penalties 

in june 2009 a shareholder plaintiff filed a purported derivative action in the superior court of new jersey morris county on behalf of the company against certain present and former directors and officers of the company based on among other things their alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the manufacture marketing sale and billing related to certain test kits manufactured by nid the complaint includes claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and seeks among other things damages and remission of compensation received by the individual defendants the company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on june 30 2010 the motion was granted and the time for an appeal has expired 

in april 2010 a putative class action was filed against the company and nid in the us district court for the eastern district of new york on behalf of entities that allegedly purchased or paid for certain of nid’s test kits the complaint alleges that certain of nid’s test kits were defective and that defendants among other things violated rico and state consumer protection laws the complaint alleges an unspecified amount of damages 

in august 2010 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the superior court of new jersey morris county on behalf of the company against the directors and certain present officers of the company the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with among other things alleged overcharges by the company to medical for testing services and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and equitable relief

in addition the company and certain of its subsidiaries have received subpoenas from state agencies in five states and from the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services which seek documents relating to the company’s billing practices the company is cooperating with the requests 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on new theories as to the company’s practices which management believes to be in compliance with law in addition certain federal and state statutes including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers the company is aware of certain pending individual or class action lawsuits and has received several subpoenas related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act andor other federal and state statutes regulations or other laws the company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers” as to which the company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability 

several of these matters are in their early stages of development and involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas while the company believes that at least a reasonable possibility exists that losses may have been incurred based on the nature and status of the investigations the losses are either currently not probable or a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

management has established reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the matters discussed above such reserves totaled approximately 10 million as of december 31 2010 management cannot predict the outcome of such matters although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition the outcome may be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid

as a general matter providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims these suits could involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the company’s client base and reputation the company maintains various liability insurance coverages for among other things claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures the company’s insurance coverage limits its maximum exposure on individual claims however the company is essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims reserves for such matters including those associated with both asserted and incurred but not reported claims are established by considering actuarially determined losses based upon the company’s historical and projected loss experience such reserves totaled approximately 130 million and 135 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively management believes that established reserves and present insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the company although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition the outcome may be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or paid

we believe that our healthcare information technology capabilities and our collaboration with others regarding healthcare information technology initiatives differentiate us from the competition 

t he united states clinical testing market 

most clinical tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories commercial clinical laboratories or physicianoffice laboratories we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

  key trends there are a number of key trends that we expect to have a significant impact on the clinical testing business in the united states and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks the current economic slowdown may temporarily reduce industry growth rates however because clinical testing is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

  demographics the growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing 

increased testing we believe that we have entered the decade of diagnostics moving from dominant focus on curative care to a greater recognition of the value of detection prevention and personalized care physicians increasingly are relying on diagnostic testing to help identify risk for a disease to detect the symptoms of disease earlier to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection prevention and treatment 

  science and technology advances medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests these advances also are spurring interest in and demand for personalized or tailored medicine which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing in addition pharmacogenetic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumorspecific genetic markers 

  health information technologies demand is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is an increasing focus on interconnectivity the ability to interact with other software and systems and real time data aggregation electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

customer and payer consolidation our customers and payers including physicians health insurance plans employers pharmaceutical companies and others have been consolidating we expect that this trend will continue consolidation is increasing customer and payer bargaining power enhancing purchasing sophistication and encouraging internalization of testing 

  highly competitive the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors new market entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations we also are expanding into new diagnostic testing areas that are highly competitive 

  legislative regulatory and policy environment government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and increasing the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act included laws designed to expedite the implementation of electronic health records and build a national electronic health infrastructure in the united states in addition there has been extensive discussion of us federal legislation to reform healthcare it is not possible to predict whether us federal legislation to reform healthcare will be enacted or the nature or impact of any such legislation 

prevention and wellness  there is an increased awareness of the benefits of and increased interest in preventative medicine and wellness consumers employers health plans and government agencies increasingly are focusing on helping the healthy stay healthy detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease 

  globalization there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems in these countries additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally may also create opportunities 

  customers and payers we provide testing services to a broad range of customers with orders for clinical testing generally generated by physicians hospitals and employers in most cases the customer that orders the testing is not responsible for the payments for services we consider a party that refers a test to us a “customer” and a party that reimburses us a “payer” depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients such as a health insurance plan selfinsured employer benefit fund or the traditional medicare or medicaid program 2 the patient or 3 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 

the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the percentage of our total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical testing business during 2009 applicable to each payer group 

 health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for clinical testing services performed reimbursement from our two largest health plans totaled approximately 14 of our consolidated net revenues in 2009 our largest health plan accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated net revenues in 2009 

  physicians physicians including both primary care physicians and specialists requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical testing volume physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including participation in a health plan network price and depth and breadth of test and service offering physicians also purchase and utilize our pointofcare tests 

health plans health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from clinical testing the trend of consolidation among health plans has continued in certain markets such as california health plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” the ability to negotiate for clinical testing services on behalf of certain members 

health plans and ipas often require that clinical test service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically lower than our overall average reimbursement rate health plans continue to focus product offerings on pointofservice “pos” plans and consumer driven health plans “cdhps” that offer a greater choice of healthcare providers reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements in addition several health plans have made strategic acquisitions or have developed products to more broadly serve the individual nongroup market we do not expect that the design of these plans will pose a significant barrier to accessing clinical testing services increased number of patients in cdhps and high deductible plans such as those offered in the individual market generally require greater levels of patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health plans however have limited their laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved pricing in cases where members choose to use a noncontracted provider due to service quality or convenience the noncontracted provider is generally reimbursed at rates considered “reasonable and customary” contracted rates are generally lower than “reasonable and customary” rates 

we also may be a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers a member of a health plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of testing services by offering health plans services and programs that leverage our company’s expertise and resources including in such areas as wellness and disease management 

  hospitals hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing typically are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states including esoteric testing in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospital’s histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform tests their patients need and compete with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves we believe that our combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals available for consultation innovative connectivity products pointofcare testing products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospital customers 

most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus are frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships 

employers employers use clinical tests for drugsofabuse to determine an individual’s employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high turnover safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugsofabuse testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace we also offer employers our blueprint for wellness program providing wellness screening and analytic services to employers to help employers and their employees manage increasing healthcare costs and to capitalize on trends in personalized health 

  other laboratories and other customers  we also provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and perform esoteric testing services for commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

g eneral 

competition while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized esoteric laboratories and laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to bring pathologists into those practices thereby reducing referrals from those practices 

 we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas we also believe that offering the most comprehensive test menu in the industry innovative test and information technology offerings a superior patient experience six sigma quality and unparalleled access and distribution provides us with a competitive advantage that enables us to compete on more than price alone 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers and members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical testing industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability in addition recent market activity including actions by payers to exclude large national clinical laboratories from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional laboratories 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without 

requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our net revenues with our pointofcare test strategy we are positioning ourselves to service this growing market for physicians and hospitals we also believe that our overall pointofcare test strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment 

the diagnostic product life insurance services clinical trials and healthcare information technology markets are highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in these markets and some of which have greater resources we compete in the diagnostic products market by attempting to find and exploit unique differentiated products including products that take advantage of our healthcare information technology solutions we compete in the life insurance services business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience faster services completion and a wider array of highest quality integrated services than our competitors we compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the world’s leading diagnostic testing company including the depth and breadth of our testing menu our superior scientific expertise our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions we compete in the healthcare information technology market by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare institutions patients and physician practices particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices there is no guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets 

sales and marketing our sales force is organized to focus on customer groups and service types the majority of representatives focus on marketing clinical laboratory testing anatomic pathology and related services to physicians including physician specialists supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex tests in addition we have a sales force that focuses on regional and national insurance organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on meeting the unique clinical testing needs of hospitals a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling drugsofabuse and wellness testing to employers we also have a sales force that focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to life insurance companies in addition we have a sales organization that focuses on selling diagnostic products to hospitals commercial clinical laboratories physician office laboratories blood banks and clinics and a sales force that sells our pointofcare tests to customers globally we also have a sales force that focuses on selling our clinical trials services to drug developers we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and profitability of all accounts 

information technology we use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical laboratory testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we believe that our healthcare information technology systems help differentiate us favorably we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our company patients and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and we continue to use nonstandardized billing laboratory or other core information systems we have standardized some of our systems and are implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems across our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improved operating efficiency more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment 

quality assurance in our clinical testing business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection handling storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on positive patient identification of specimens report accuracy proficiency testing reference range relevance process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we also focus on the licensing credentialing training and competence of our professional and technical staff we are implementing an enhanced specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that will enable us to better track specimens we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry in addition some of our laboratories have achieved international organization for standardization or iso certification these certifications are international standards for quality management systems in 2009 we took a number of steps to further enhance our quality assurance program including devoting additional resources to the program and taking advantage of technology advances designed to improve quality assurance 

as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program we utilize internal proficiency testing extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our clinical laboratory operations for most clinical laboratory tests quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes 

we participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the college of american pathologists “cap” and certain states all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by cap as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by clia cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories including our facility in india and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states europe and australia they are regulated by the fda and are required to be in compliance with the quality systems regulations 21 cfr part 820 and with applicable standards outside the us in addition our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with or audited by the deemed authority for iso 13485 2003 standards we endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with quality systems regulations so that the finished products are safe and effective in addition the diagnostics products businesses maintain procedures designed to ensure that products we purchase conform to the manufacturer’s specifications 

intellectual property rights we own significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries from time to time we also license us and nonus patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights or trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business we believe however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole 

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we generally actively defend our intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business 

employees at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 43000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

b illing and reimbursement 

billing we generally bill for clinical testing services on a feeforservice basis under one of two types of fee schedules these fees are generally subject to negotiation with or discounted to nongovernmental payers the types of fee schedules are 

 billing for clinical testing services is very complicated and we have compliance policies and procedures that increase our billing costs patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all have different billing requirements some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers and there are several other factors that complicate billing eg disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to coverage billing and reimbursement changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process 

as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

in 2009 our bad debt expense was 43 of our net revenues we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and advance beneficiary notices abns received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact our bad debt expense in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

government coverage and reimbursements government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and can be expected to continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services for example medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years historically many different local carriers administered medicare part b which covers services provided by commercial clinical laboratories they often had inconsistent policies increasing the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories they are being replaced with contractors who will administer part b benefits for beneficiaries in larger regional areas it is expected that the revised system will reduce the administrative complexity of billing for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

with regard to the clinical test services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing medicare patients generally are required to make copayments for anatomic pathology services 

federal law contains a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for clinical testing services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program and a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare fee schedules during 2009 medicare and medicaid programs represented approximately 18 of our net revenues effective january 1 2010 the national fee schedule for clinical testing services was decreased 19 

federal law also contains a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for pathology and other physician services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program in december 2009 congress enacted a 60day hold on a potential 212 decrease in this schedule that would otherwise have gone into effect january 1 2010 in 2009 approximately 3 of our net revenues were reimbursed based on this fee schedule 

cms is permitted to adjust statutorily prescribed fees for clinical test services if the standard rules by which those payments are calculated will result in fees that are “grossly excessive” cms rules set forth a process and factors for establishing a “realistic and equitable” payment amount for clinical test services under medicare part b and services paid under a prospective payment system if existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be considered unreasonable if they are either grossly excessive or deficient under cms rules if cms or a carrier determines that an overall payment adjustment of less than 15 is needed to produce a realistic and equitable payment amount then the payment amount is not considered “grossly excessive or deficient” however if a determination is made that a payment adjustment of 15 or more is justified cms could provide an adjustment of less than 15 but not more than 15 in any given year fees payable by medicare could be reduced prospectively as a result of the application of these rules 

we are generally permitted to bill medicare beneficiaries directly for statutorily excluded testing services an advance beneficiary notice “abn” is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patient’s informed decision to personally assume financial liability for tests which are likely to be denied and not reimbursed by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically necessary for the patient these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests ordered on a patient at a 

frequency greater than covered by medicare we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the physician’s office staff who must obtain the abn on our behalf if the abn is not timely provided to the beneficiary or is not completed properly we may end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient if payment is denied by medicare due to coverage limitations 

penalties for violations of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for damages on a per violation basis plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs directly administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these plans in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements if these efforts continue to be successful we may experience a further shift of traditional medicare and medicaid beneficiaries to private health insurance options 

r egulation 

our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business these laws and regulations include regulations over aspects of our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting our business generally eg export controls laws us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions including in the united states and in the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business we also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory areas applicable to our businesses 

clia and state clinical laboratory licensing regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests before approval for use or marketing of services 

fraud and abuse rules federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory some states also have laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over among other areas instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the united states the fda also regulates clinical trials and therefore testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials drugsofabuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization a number of 

esoteric tests we develop internally are first offered as laboratorydeveloped tests “ldts” the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all ldts but has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most ldts performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories however the fda has been petitioned to exercise regulatory authority over certain ldts and to initiate enforcement action against companies that make effectiveness claims about ldts that are without sufficient analytical and clinical support in addition the fda has issued two drafts of a guidance document describing certain ldts it refers to as “in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays” the fda could finalize this guidance document clarifying its intention to regulate these tests as medical devices and the laboratories that offer this subset of ldts if fda regulation of this subset of ldts occurs or if increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing ensues it would lead to an increased regulatory burden resulting in additional costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests this may hinder us from developing and marketing certain new products or services 

in september 2007 the fda finalized its guidance relating to analyte specific reagents “asrs” which laboratories use in ldts as a result manufacturers of certain products previously marketed as asrs must file for fda clearance of these products in order to market them in the united states failure to act diligently and to cooperate with the fda may result in enforcement action against the manufacturer the increased regulation of these products could result in increased product cost a delay in obtaining them or if a manufacturer withdraws its products from the market an inability to obtain the product these factors may hinder our ability to develop and market new products or services or cause an increase in the cost of our products or services 

our diagnostic product business is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and postmarket surveillance of diagnostic products prior to commercially marketing or selling most diagnostic products in the u s we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda similarly we may need to obtain a license or certification such as a ce mark in order to sell diagnostic products outside of the u s compliance with the ivdd allows us to market in europe once we obtain a ce mark obtainable where the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic inspections and reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for noncompliance such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions where appropriate voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls may be undertaken 

environmental health and safety we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment the health and safety of employees and the handling transportation and disposal of medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials for example the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the u s this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick injuries for purposes of transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies the us department of transportation the us public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association we generally use thirdparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

contracts and relationships with physicians we employ pathologists many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

many states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these laws vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which 

medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

some states restrict the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and nonphysicians these laws may apply to some of the arrangements that we have with pathologists the laws vary from state to state 

privacy and security of health and personal information healthcare providers and others involved in providing healthcare services to patients are required to comply with the federal health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare information as well as hipaa standards for electronic healthcare transactions in the united states the hipaa regulations on adoption of national provider identifiers required healthcare providers to adopt new unique identifiers for reporting on claims transactions the security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding electronic patient information the privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information new federal laws adopted in 2009 impose additional obligations on healthcare providers regarding the privacy and security of protected health information increase the penalties associated with the failure to meet the hipaa regulatory requirements allow state attorneys general to enforce violations of the hipaa privacy and security regulations and require healthcare providers to notify patients and the government if they discover certain breaches of the patient’s unsecured protected health information these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects we have implemented practices that we believe meet the requirements 

we also must comply with privacy and security laws and regulations adopted by states in the united states and jurisdictions outside the united states in which we conduct business including the european union some of these laws and regulations relate to the privacy and security of personal information such as social security numbers some of the laws and regulations impose reporting and disclosure requirements in the event of certain security breaches we have implemented practices that we believe meet applicable requirements 

drug testing controlled substances all us laboratories that perform drug testing for public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the substance abuse and mental health services administration to obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugsofabuse testing in the united states laboratories must be licensed by the drug enforcement administration all of our laboratories that perform such testing or that use controlled substances are so certified or so licensed respectively 

compliance we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including many of those relating to billing reimbursement of tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statues regulations and other laws including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on theories as to our current practices that we believe are lawful the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 18 

of our net revenues during 2009 we believe that based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its enforcement efforts against healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

 i tem 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report including the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of our securities the risks below are not the only ones that we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also negatively impact us our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors 

this report also includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks or uncertainties our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks we face described below and elsewhere see “cautionary factors that may affect future results” on page 29 

continued weakness in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the economies of the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business have recently experienced significant weakness which in the case of the us has resulted in significant unemployment and reduced economic activity a continued decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products thus reducing our revenue these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical test providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the practices to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality of service our failure to provide a broad test menu or service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our net revenues and profitability could be damaged 

our business could be adversely impacted if healthcare reform focuses on reducing healthcare costs but does not recognize the value and importance of diagnostic testing 

government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and may increase there has been extensive discussion of us federal legislation to reform healthcare while it is not possible to predict whether us federal legislation to reform healthcare will be enacted or the nature or impact of any such legislation our business could be adversely impacted if healthcare reform legislation focuses on reducing healthcare costs but does not appropriately recognize the value and importance of diagnostic testing 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis cms changes add to our costs by increasing complexity and administrative requirements for billing medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements if these efforts continue to be successful we may experience a further shift of traditional medicare and medicaid beneficiaries to private health insurance options recently state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses that may impact our business such as delaying payments reducing reimbursement restricting coverage eligibility service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services 

from time to time the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care in 2008 congress enacted legislation that revoked cms’ authority to conduct a competitive bidding demonstration project for clinical testing services state governments also have considered from time to time whether to apply competitive bidding to clinical testing services the industry remains concerned about the potential use of competitive bidding for clinical testing services and believes that the quality of services and access to those services could be adversely impacted by implementation of competitive bidding and the award of testing service contracts to a few test providers if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect us 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

healthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including healthcare plans to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical testing providers these healthcare plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing there are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among healthcare plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer 

we expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare plan may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as strategic acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that was previously operated independently and has different systems processes policies and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of 

the following difficulties among others 

 if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or in a timely manner 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency 

as noted above government payers and healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services including clinical testing services such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of these activities our business could be negatively affected 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including many of those relating to 

 these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our products if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we 

also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” the federal and state governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 18 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be timeconsuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business opportunities 

information technology it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems we also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems nevertheless we may experience damages to our systems and system failures and interruptions 

in addition we are in the process of implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems which we expect will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for tests in a timely manner if our operations are interrupted it could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests that may result in a decrease in the demand for our tests or cause us to reduce the prices of our tests our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to obtain maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights in addition we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients or the internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices although the clia compliance costs make it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to both physicians and patients of test kits approved by the fda for pointofcare testing or home use development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our net revenues 

our customers such as hospitals and physicians may internalize tests that we currently perform if our customers were to internalize tests that we currently perform and we did not develop new or alternative tests attractive 

to our customers the demand for our testing services may be reduced and our net revenues may be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 31 billion of debt outstanding except for outstanding letters of credit and operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s and moody’s investor services and fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan could increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in this case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource the supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists with positive relationships with their respective local medical communities particularly those with subspecialties our earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of clinical testing services including anatomic pathology services and related services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

the failure of our it systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 

public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology hcit standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including test orders and test results could require costly modifications to our existing hcit systems while we do not expect hcit standards to be 

adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing hcit standards we could lose customers and business opportunities 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies 

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the united states our expanding international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in local jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

we expect to expand further our international operations through acquisition or otherwise which would increase these risks as a result of these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our medical diagnostic products business is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant diagnostics products 

our medical diagnostic products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states including the fda and by regulatory authorities outside the united states including the european commission the process of obtaining regulatory clearance or approval to market a medical diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and clearance or approval for future products is never certain even when additional indications or uses of existing products are sought securing clearance or approval is not predictable delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain clearance or approval for future products or new indications or uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 

in addition no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product these requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns our diagnostic product facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities failure to comply with applicable rules could result in among other things substantial modifications to our business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of our products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation the 

inability timely to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation revenues profitability or financial condition 

our efforts to develop commercially successful medical diagnostic products may not succeed 

we may commit substantial efforts funds and other resources to developing commercially successful medical diagnostic products a high rate of failure is inherent in the development of new medical diagnostic products there is no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be commercially successful failure can occur at any point in the development process including after significant funds have been invested 

promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals failure to achieve market adoption limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products changing customer preferences or changing industry standards innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our medical diagnostic products under development will be launched whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire products or whether any diagnostic products will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes health pandemics hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees’ ability to perform their job duties in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

our business could be adversely impacted by cms’ adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2013 we may be required to incur significant expense in implementing the new coding set and if we do not adequately implement it our business could be adversely impacted in addition if as a result of the new coding set physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests we may not be reimbursed for such tests 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management’s attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of our corporate integrity agreement we could be subject to suspension or termination from participation in federal healthcare programs and substantial monetary penalties 

as part of a settlement with the us department of justice and other federal government agencies in april 2009 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general if we fail to comply with our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement we could be suspended or terminated from participating in certain federal healthcare programs and subject to substantial monetary penalties

nid matter 

nid a test kit manufacturing subsidiary and the company each received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york during the fourth quarter of 2004 the subpoenas requested a wide range of business records including documents regarding parathyroid hormone “pth” test kits manufactured by nid and pth testing performed by the company the company has voluntarily and actively cooperated with the investigation providing information witnesses and business records of nid and the company including documents related to pth tests and test kits as well as other tests and test kits in the second and third quarters of 2005 the fda conducted an inspection of nid and issued a form 483 listing the observations made by the fda during the course of the inspection nid responded to the form 483 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 nid instituted its second voluntary product hold within a sixmonth period due to quality issues which adversely impacted the operating performance of nid as a result the company evaluated a number of strategic options for nid and on april 19 2006 decided to cease operations at nid upon completion of the wind down of operations in the third quarter of 2006 the operations of nid were classified as discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2006 the government issued two additional subpoenas one to nid and one to the company the subpoenas covered various records including records related to tests and test kits in addition to pth 

during the third quarter of 2007 the government and the company began settlement discussions in the course of those discussions the government disclosed to the company certain of the government’s legal theories regarding the amount of damages allegedly incurred by the government which include alleged violations of civil and criminal statutes including the false claims act and the food drug and cosmetics act violations of these statutes and related regulations could lead to a warning letter injunction fines or penalties exclusion from federal healthcare programs andor criminal prosecution as well as claims by third parties during the third quarter of 2008 the company and the united states attorney’s office reached an agreement in principle to resolve these claims as part of the agreement nid which was closed in 2006 is expected to enter a guilty plea to a single count of felony misbranding the terms of the settlement are subject to the final negotiation and execution of definitive agreements which is expected to include a corporate integrity agreement the approval by the united states department of justice and the united states department of health and human services and satisfactory resolution of related state claims there can be no assurance however when or whether a settlement may be finalized or as to its terms if a settlement is not finalized the company would defend itself and nid and could incur significant costs in doing so 

the company has established a reserve of 316 million in connection with these claims through charges reflected in discontinued operations the reserve reflects the company’s current estimate of the expected probable loss with respect to these matters assuming the settlement is finalized if a settlement is not finalized the eventual losses related to these matters could be materially different than the amount reserved and could be material to the company’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition in the period that such matters are determined or paid 

other matters 

during the second quarter of 2005 the company received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey the subpoena seeks the production of business and financial records regarding capitation and risk sharing arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993 through 1999 also during the third quarter of 2005 the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of the inspector general the subpoena seeks the production of various business records including records regarding our relationship with health maintenance organizations independent physician associations group purchasing organizations and preferred provider organizations relating back to as early as 1995 the company is cooperating with the united states attorney’s office and the office of the inspector general 

during the second quarter of 2006 each of the company and its subsidiary specialty laboratories inc “specialty” received a subpoena from the california attorney general’s office the subpoenas seek various documents including documents relating to billings to medical the california medicaid program the subpoenas seek documents from various time frames ranging from three to ten years during the third quarter of 2008 the company received a request for additional information the company and specialty are cooperating with the california attorney general’s office 

in the first quarter of 2008 the united states department of justice informally requested records from the company regarding ameripath’s billing practices for flow cytometry testing panels performed on blood bone marrow and lymph node specimens the inquiry sought to determine whether ameripath may have billed for laboratory tests that were not medically necessary the company cooperated fully with the inquiry in december 2008 the government declined to intervene in the underlying qui tam complaint that led to the inquiry following the government’s declination the qui tam relator voluntarily dismissed his complaint 

we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” as to which we cannot determine the extent of any potential liability we also are aware of certain pending individual or class action lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act andor other federal and state statutes regulations or other laws

business operations 

quest diagnostics is the leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the united states providing insights that enable patients and physicians to make decisions to improve health services we offer patients and physicians the broadest access to diagnostic testing services through our nationwide network of laboratories and owned patient service centers the company provides interpretive consultation through the largest medical and scientific staff in the industry with approximately 900 mds and phds around the country we are the leading provider of genebased testing and other esoteric testing anatomic pathology services including dermatopathology and testing for drugsofabuse the company is also a leading provider of testing for clinical trials and risk assessment services for the life insurance industry our diagnostics products business manufactures and markets diagnostic test kits and specialized pointofcare testing we empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with robust information technology solutions our activities are discussed below 

in 2007 our clinical testing business accounted for greater than 90 of our net revenues with the balance derived from insurer services clinical trials testing diagnostic products and healthcare information technology most of our services are provided in the united states clinical testing includes routine testing anatomic pathology genebased and esoteric testing and drugsofabuse testing which generated approximately 55 15 18 and 3 respectively of our 2007 net revenues risk assessment services for the life insurance industry clinical trials testing diagnostic products and healthcare information technology combined generated approximately 9 of our 2007 net revenues in 2007 we derived approximately 3 of our net revenues from foreign operations 

  clinical testing clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use clinical tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services clinical laboratory testing is performed on body fluids such as blood and urine anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues including biopsies and other samples such as human cells many clinical tests are considered routine and can be performed by most commercial clinical laboratories tests that are not routine and that require highly skilled personnel and generally require more sophisticated equipment are considered esoteric tests esoteric tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that specialize in performing those tests 

we are the largest commercial clinical testing company in the us with a leading position in most us geographic markets and service offerings we offer customers the broadest access in the nation to clinical and anatomic pathology testing and the most extensive test menu including our joint ventures we operate a network of approximately 2100 of our own patient service centers principal laboratories located in more than 30 major metropolitan areas throughout the united states and approximately 150 smaller “rapidresponse” laboratories we also operate approximately 40 outpatient anatomic pathology centers and provide inpatient anatomic pathology and medical director services for hospitals throughout the us 

we provide interpretive consultation through the largest medical and scientific staff in the industry with approximately 900 mds and phds around the country as testing methods become more complex we believe that providing sound medical and scientific consultation regarding the correct application of tests and the correct interpretation of test results will help spur the adoption of new tests improve patient outcomes and enhance client satisfaction our medical and scientific directors are available for consultation with our customers 

routine clinical testing we are the leading provider in the united states of routine clinical testing including testing for drugsofabuse 

we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories rapid response laboratories and patient service centers we also perform routine testing at the hospital laboratories we manage our major laboratories offer a full line of routine clinical tests rapid response laboratories are smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times patient service centers are facilities where specimens are collected and are typically located in or near a building used by medical professionals we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most routine tests within 24 hours the majority of test results are delivered electronically 

routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include 

 anatomic pathology we are the leading provider of anatomic pathology services including dermatopathology in the us anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through the examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients we provide anatomic pathology and other cancer diagnostic testing through our centers of excellence and approximately 40 outpatient anatomic pathology centers additionally we provide inpatient anatomic pathology and medical director services for hospitals throughout the country we have a substantial presence in target markets to deliver our services locally and enable our pathologists to establish strong relationships with our referring physician base 

we significantly strengthened our anatomic pathology services offering through our may 2007 acquisition of ameripath group holdings inc “ameripath” we provide a fullrange of cancer diagnostic services to all specialties including dermatopathology gastroenterology hematology urology and oncology we have approximately 800 boardcertified pathologists including luminaries in their field with a passion for and dedication to serving patients with the highest quality service 

we have a strong history of leadership and innovation in cancer diagnostics we introduced the leumeta™ family of tests for leukemia and lymphoma these are proprietary plasmabased molecular tests that may some day eliminate the need for painful bone marrow biopsies we offer pap testing using liquidbased technology in addition to conventional pap testing and provide physicians the option of computer assisted pap screening we were among those leading the industry in educating physicians about molecular testing for human papilloma virus “hpv” the leading cause of cervical cancer 

genebased and other esoteric testing genebased and esoteric tests are typically ordered when a physician requires additional information to complete a diagnosis establish a prognosis or choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics protein chemistry cellular immunology and advanced microbiology commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests drug therapy monitoring tests autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations esoteric tests are those tests that require professional “handson” attention from highly skilled technical personnel that generally require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials and that may be performed less frequently than routine tests consequently esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests because it is not costeffective for most hospitals independent laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests or to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse these tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory such as our nichols institute or focus diagnostics that specializes in performing these complex tests 

we are the leading provider in the united states of genebased and other esoteric testing we believe that we have the largest genebased and esoteric testing business in the united states with over 12 billion in net revenues during 2007 we conduct complex and specialized testing including molecular diagnostics on both coasts through our world renowned nichols institute laboratory facilities which are among the leading esoteric clinical testing laboratories in the world 

our esoteric laboratories offer reference testing services to large academic medical centers hospitals and commercial laboratories our esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of complex tests that are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories generally in the following fields 

 new test introduction we are a leading innovator bringing new and improved tests to the market genebased and other esoteric tests are the fastest growing area within the diagnostic testing industry we believe that the unveiling of the human genome and the linkages of genes and the proteins they produce with disease are resulting in and will continue to result in more complex and thorough predictive and diagnostic testing we are well positioned to benefit from this growth we intend to focus on commercializing diagnostic applications of discoveries in the areas of cancer cardiovascular disease and infectious disease as well as functional genomics and proteomics including the area of personalized medicine we are committed to introducing clinically relevant and leading edge diagnostic tests we bring tests to market that we develop as well as through relationships with diagnostic technology developers we are a leader in 

transferring technical innovations to the market through our relationships with the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms as well as through collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies as the industry leader we believe that we are the best partner for developers of new technology and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we focus our resources on key disease states including cancer cardiovascular disease and infectious disease and technologies that will help doctors care for their patients through better screening diagnosis prognosis treatment choice and monitoring during 2007 we introduced new and improved assays and services principally in the following areas 

 5 

 we believe that offering a full range of genebased and other esoteric tests including new tests strengthens our market offering and market position and enhances our reputation as the nation’s leading test provider 

  clinical trials testing we believe that we are the second largest provider of central laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs and vaccines clinical research trials are required by the us food and drug administration and other international regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs and vaccines we have clinical trials testing centers in the united states and the united kingdom and we provide clinical trials testing in australia china and singapore through affiliated laboratories we are launching a clinical trials testing center in india approximately 45 of our net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2007 represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc gsk we are the primary provider of central laboratory testing to support gsk’s clinical trials testing requirements worldwide 

  insurer and employer services we believe that we are the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in the united states and canada our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life insurance industry including teleunderwriting specimen collection and paramedical examinations clinical testing medical record retrieval case management motor vehicle reports telephone inspections prescription histories and credit checks the clinical tests performed and data gathered by us are specifically designed to assist an insurance company in objectively evaluating the mortality and morbidity risks posed by policy applicants the majority of the testing is performed on specimens of individual life insurance policy applicants but also includes specimens of individuals applying for other types of insurance policies we also provide risk assessment services for insurance companies doing business in many countries outside the united states we plan in 2008 to commence providing risk assessment services in india we operate approximately 70 locations in the united states and canada where we coordinate providing paramedical examinations we also contract with third parties for these services at approximately 120 locations across the united states and canada we are actively performing paramedical examinations in select patient service centers because many life insurance applicants prefer this option to a home or workplace examination 

we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical testing to employers for drugsofabuse our drug testing index which is an annual report of our aggregate drug testing results is used nationally by employers the federal government and the media to help understand and explain drug abuse among the nation’s workforce we also provide wellness testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in improving their health and empowering employers with aggregated health information our blueprint for wellness program offers employers actionable data to power their health improvement and cost containment programs 

  diagnostic products including pointofcare or near patient testing technology advances are enabling testing to move closer to the patient and are becoming increasingly available and reliable over time some testing that is now done in clinical laboratories will cease to be performed in clinical laboratories and will be performed closer to the patient we believe that our pointofcare testing strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment we are wellpositioned to offer options and integrated solutions to physicians hospitals and clinics for the testing methods that are most appropriate for each patient and practice 

we develop and manufacture products that enable healthcare professionals to make healthcare diagnoses including products for pointofcare or near patient testing for the professional market since july 2006 we have acquired several companies including focus diagnostics enterix and hemocue that enhance our offerings and better enable us to serve these markets we will consider additional acquisitions or licenses of selective products to complement 

the products and services we provide we offer an electronic data link through our care360 physician portal so that the results of the insure tm quik fit pointofcare tests as well as tests performed by our laboratories will be available in one electronic medical record we intend to offer additional data links in the future this will differentiate our pointofcare test products from other products that are not integrated into an electronic repository 

focus diagnostics is a leading provider of infectious disease testing that has established a reputation for being first to introduce new tests to the market including diagnostic tests for lyme disease west nile virus and sars focus diagnostics develops manufactures and markets diagnostic products such as herpeselect ® elisa tests that detect patient antibodies to specific types of herpes simplex virus which can be performed on a variety of instrument platforms focus received food and drug administration “fda” 510k clearance to sell in the us its new multiplexed plexus ® product to detect type specific antibodies to herpes simplex virus focus has also submitted an application to the fda for 510k clearance to allow us sales of plexus ® products for the detection of antibodies specific to epsteinbarr virus both the plexus ® products have received the ce mark and are available for purchase in european union countries focus diagnostics sells its diagnostic products to large academic medical centers hospitals and commercial laboratories globally 

enterix an australiabased company manufactures the insure tm fecal immunochemical fit test for screening for colorectal cancer it has developed and plans to release early in 2008 the insure tm quik fit test for pointofcare testing 

hemocue headquartered in angelholm sweden specializes in pointofcare testing hemocue is the leading global provider in pointofcare testing for hemoglobin with a growing market share for professional glucose and microalbumin testing the measurement of hemoglobin is important for blood donors and for patients being considered for transfusion therapy or undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy where instant test results can lead to immediate treatment decisions hemocue’s handheld systems are used in physician’s offices blood banks hospitals diabetes clinics and public health clinics in developing countries these systems are used as the primary means to screen for anemia approximately onehalf of hemocue’s products are sold outside the united states hemocue has a strong product development pipeline based on its pioneering use of its patented microfluidic systems 

in october 2007 hemocue received fda 510k clearance for its white blood cell analyzer a wholeblood test performed on fingerstick samples that assist physicians diagnosing infection inflammation bone marrow failure autoimmune diseases and many other medical conditions now routinely tested by reference laboratories in addition focus diagnostics received fda 510k clearance for its herpeselect® express™ hsv2 a test for aiding in the diagnosis of herpes simplex type2 virus the primary cause of genital herpes with 510k clearance for marketing physicians who operate cliacertified moderately complex laboratories may now use these products to quickly produce results in a single office visit these two tests will help physicians quickly determine the presence of an infection and allow physicians to make immediate treatment decisions for their patients we have applied for cliawaived status for these two products and a microalbumin test which if granted would permit physicians to use these products in a much larger segment of physician offices 

  international we have laboratory facilities in mexico city mexico san juan puerto rico and heston england these laboratories support our clinical trials business and clinical testing in their local markets in addition we have established operations in gurgaon india that will support our business activities in that country we see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic testing and pointofcare products to international markets particularly developing countries where the testing markets are highly fragmented and less mature 

  healthcare information technology we empower healthcare organizations and clinicians with information technology solutions that can improve patient care and medical practice we develop differentiated products that are designed to support the creation and management of patient records by bringing together in one patientcentric view information from various sources including physician’s records and laboratory and hospital data we believe that these products enhance the value we provide to our customers and result in increased customer loyalty by providing more convenient ordering and reporting of clinical tests and better access to patientcentric information 

we develop and integrate clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare organizations physicians and clinicians primarily through our care360 suite of products and the chartmaxx ® electronic document management system for hospitals the care360 products including our care360 physician portal enable physicians to order diagnostic tests and review test results from quest diagnostics online in addition the care360 physician portal enables physicians to electronically prescribe medication view clinical and administrative information in a patientcentric record maintained in our repository and share confidential information with medical colleagues in a hipaacompliant manner demand has been growing for our information technology solutions as physicians have expanded their usage of the internet by the end of 2007 approximately 125000 physicians were using our care360 products and excluding our recently acquired ameripath business approximately 65 of our test orders and approximately 75 of our test results were being transmitted electonically in december 2007 approximately 140000 eprescribing scripts were processed through care360 

additionally we have recently acquired the capabilities to deploy a health information exchange system comprised of proprietary technologies that enable healthcare providers to access and manage a range of patient data from multiple sources at the pointofcare these capabilities will enable us to provide solutions to the many health information exchanges that are being developed 

the united states clinical testing market 

most clinical tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories account for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

  key trends there are a number of key trends that we expect to have a significant impact on the clinical testing business in the us and on our business these trends present both opportunities and risks we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

demographics  the growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing 

increased testing  we believe that we are entering the decade of diagnostics moving to preventative care from curative care physicians increasingly are relying on testing to aid in the identification of risk factors and symptoms of disease the choice of therapeutic regimen and the evaluation of treatment results physicians consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection and prevention 

science and technology advances  medical advancements allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests 

health information technologies  demand is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients payers and practitioners by improving access to patient data increasing patient participation in care management reducing medical errors and improving clinical outcomes there is an increasing focus on interconnectivity and desire for real time data aggregation electronic medical records and patient health records continue to grow 

customer consolidation  our customers including health insurance plans employers pharmaceutical companies and other intermediaries have been consolidating we expect that this trend will continue consolidation is increasing customer bargaining power and enhancing their purchasing sophistication 

highly competitive  the clinical testing industry remains fragmented is highly competitive and is subject to new competition competition is growing from nontraditional competitors new market entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations we also are expanding into new diagnostic testing areas that are highly competitive 

regulatory and policy environment  government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the united states is significant and may increase 

globalization  there is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems in these countries additionally our customers are establishing positions outside the united states demographic changes globally may also create opportunities 

  customers and payers we provide testing services to a broad range of customers with orders for clinical testing generally generated by physician offices hospitals and employers in most cases the customer that orders the testing is not responsible for the payments of services we consider a party that refers a test to us a “customer” and a party that reimburses us a “payer” depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients such as a health insurance plan selfinsured employer benefit fund or the traditional medicare or medicaid program 2 the patient or 3 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 

the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the percentage of our total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical testing business during 2007 applicable to each payer group 

 health insurers including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers which typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for clinical testing services performed represent approximately onehalf of our net revenues from clinical testing reimbursement from our two largest health insurer payers totaled approximately 11 of our net revenues in 2007 aetna which accounted for over 6 of our consolidated net revenues for 2007 was our largest health insurer payer 

physicians physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical testing volume physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors including service patient access and convenience including inclusion in a health plan network price and depth and breadth of test and service offering 

most of our clinical testing is referred by primary care physicians we historically have provided a strong value proposition in routine and esoteric clinical testing during 2007 we acquired ameripath expanding our service capabilities this will enable us to leverage our capabilities and to more effectively compete in several physician subspecialties including dermatology urology gastroenterology hematology and oncology where historically we had a smaller market share we plan to continue to enhance our test menu and service capabilities 

health insurance plans health insurance plans including fully insured and selffunded employers typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories and represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from clinical testing in certain markets such as california health insurance plans may delegate to independent physician associations “ipas” the ability to negotiate for clinical testing services on behalf of certain members the trend of consolidation among health insurance plans has continued 

health insurance plans and ipas often demand that clinical test service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted feeforservice arrangements under capitated payment arrangements we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically less than our overall average reimbursement rate health insurance plans continue to focus product offerings on pointofservice “pos” plans and consumer driven health plans “cdhps” that offer a greater choice of healthcare providers pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements increased patients in cdhps and high deductible plans involve greater patient costsharing this could negatively impact patient collection experience 

most of our agreements with major health insurance plans are nonexclusive arrangements certain health insurance plans however have been increasingly willing to limit the laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved pricing in cases where members choose to use a noncontracted provider due to service quality or convenience the noncontracted provider is generally reimbursed at rates considered “reasonable and customary” contracted rates are generally lower than “reasonable and customary” rates because of the potential for greater volume as a contracted provider a noncontracted clinical test service provider with quality and service preferred by physicians and patients to that of contracted providers could potentially realize greater profits than if it was a contracted provider provided that physicians and patients continue to have choice in selecting their clinical test provider and any potential additional cost to the patient of using a noncontracted provider is not considered prohibitive 

we also may be a member of a “complementary network” a complementary network is generally a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that allow for discounted fees for the 

benefit of members of the customers that arrange access through the third party a member of a health insurance plan may choose to access a noncontracted provider that is a member of a complementary network if so the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network 

we offer quest net tm  a service in which we develop and administer customized networks of clinical test providers for health insurers quest net tm networks provide physicians and patients multiple choices for clinical testing health insurance plans that use these networks realize cost reductions by reducing testing performed by noncontracted providers and from simplified payment administration for clinical testing services 

hospitals and other laboratories hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing are typically negotiated on behalf of the hospitals by group purchasing organizations we believe that most hospital laboratories perform approximately 90 to 95 of their patients’ clinical tests we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states that vary from esoteric testing to helping manage their laboratories to serving as the medical directors of the hospital’s histology or clinical laboratory we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals hospitals generally continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity they perform tests needed by their patients and compete with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more costeffective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves we believe that our combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals for consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospital customers 

most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus are frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services 

we also have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships 

  we also provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and perform esoteric testing services for other commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

insurers and employers we provide services to life insurance companies and employers life insurance companies use clinical tests and other services we provide to assist in making policy issuance and premium rating decisions factors such as the number of applications for fullyunderwritten life insurance policies can affect the utilization of clinical testing and other services we provide to our insurance customers we seek to grow our insurance revenues by increasing our market share and by offering new and innovative clinical tests and other services our life insurance customers have been consolidating which has resulted in increased individual customer purchasing power we expect that this trend will continue we charge our life insurance customers on a feeforservice basis typically under multiyear agreements 

employers use clinical tests for drugsofabuse to determine an individual’s employability and his or her “fitness for duty” companies with high turnover and safety conscious environments provide the highest volumes of testing factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of clinical testing we seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal in maintaining a safe and productive workplace one of these innovations is our blueprint for wellness program where we provide wellness screenings to employers and their employees 

general 

  sales and marketing our sales force is organized to focus on customer groups and service types the majority of representatives focus on marketing clinical laboratory testing anatomic pathology and related services to physicians including physician specialists supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex tests in addition 

we have a health plan sales organization that focuses on regional and national insurance and healthcare organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on meeting the unique clinical testing needs of hospitals and promotes the specialized capabilities of our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratories and our focus diagnostics infectious and immunologic disease testing laboratory a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling substanceofabuse and wellness testing to employers we also have a sales force that focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to life insurance companies in addition we have a sales organization that focuses on selling diagnostic products to hospitals commercial clinical laboratories physician office laboratories blood banks and clinics we also have a sales force that focuses on our clinical trials services to drug developers we focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable accounts we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and profitability of all accounts 

  information technology information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical laboratory testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data we endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our patients and customers the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 

we have made substantial investments in our healthcare information technology systems and believe that they help differentiate us innovations in our healthcare information technology have the potential to improve patient care promote efficiency and reduce expense both at the federal and state levels there are public and private efforts to bring together healthcare providers information technology vendors and other stakeholders to facilitate the creation of standards for the exchange and use of electronic healthcare data including standard clinical code sets if certain healthcare data and information technology standards were adopted we could be required to make substantial investments in our systems to comply with such standards or systems 

our systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of causes including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our systems may be subject to physical or electronic breakin attempts computer viruses and similar disruptive problems we also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our systems nonetheless system failures such as those that interrupt our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and we continue to use nonstandardized billing laboratory or other core information systems we have standardized some of our systems and are implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems across our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions we expect implementation will take several more years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems improve operating efficiency provide management with more timely and comprehensive information and enhance control over our operational environment failure to properly implement the new systems could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this magnitude workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service 

  quality assurance in our clinical testing business our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on positive patient identification of specimens and reports proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry in 1998 our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratory in california was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve international organization for standardization or iso 9001 certification several other of our laboratories also are iso certified these certifications are international standards for quality management systems 

we have extensive internal proficiency testing quality control and audits for our clinical laboratory operations quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program 

we have external proficiency testing and accreditation for our clinical laboratory operations all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american pathologists “cap” as well as some state agencies cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of boardcertified pathologists approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program also all of our 

cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an individual proficiency testing program 

our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states europe and australia focus diagnostics enterix and hemocue maintain sites certified in accordance with or audited to iso 13485

our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise we generally actively defend our intellectual property assets and pursue protection on our products processes and other intellectual property where possible 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

   competition while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories our largest independent clinical laboratory competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized esoteric laboratories and laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals in anatomic pathology additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices including those in academic institutions in addition there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to bring pathologists into those practices 

we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a testing provider including 

 12 

we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas we also believe that the differentiation we are creating through our focus on a superior patient experience six sigma quality unparalleled access and distribution the most comprehensive test menu and innovative test and information technology offerings provide us with a competitive advantage and enables us to compete on more than price alone 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers and members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical testing industry will continue however a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability in addition recent market activity including actions by payers to exclude large national clinical laboratories from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional laboratories 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 complex tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our net revenues however as a result of our pointofcare test strategy we believe that we are well positioned to service this market for physicians and hospitals we also believe that our overall pointofcare test strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment 

the diagnostic product market is highly competitive we have many competitors some of which have much more extensive experience in this market and some of which have greater resources than our company we compete in this area by attempting to find and exploit unique differentiated products including products that take advantage of our healthcare information technology solutions there is no guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully in this market 

  employees at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 43500 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 

billing and reimbursement 

  billing we generally bill for clinical testing services on a feeforservice basis under one of two fee schedules these fees are generally subject to negotiation with or discounted to nongovernmental payers the fee schedules are 

 billing for clinical testing services is very complicated so we have compliance policies and procedures that increase our billing costs patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all have different billing requirements billing arrangements require us to bill various payers we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services are subject to complex stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to billing and reimbursement these regulatory requirements increase costs related to 1 the complexity of our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other factors medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process other factors that complicate billing include 

 13 

 in 2007 our bad debt expense was 45 of our net revenues we believe that most of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or missing we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information 

  billing compliance as an integral part of our billing compliance program we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any medicare or medicaid overpayments resulting from noncompliance are reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments reimbursed the overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action 

penalties for violations of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per violation plus up to three times the amount claimed 

  government reimbursements the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services with regard to the clinical test services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing certain medicaid programs require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing medicare patients generally are required to make copayments for anatomic pathology services 

federal law contains a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for clinical testing services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program and a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare fee schedules federal law also contains a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for pathology and other physician services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program these laws are periodically adjusted but an adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical testing services based on the consumer price index cannot occur before january 1 2009 in december 2007 congress changed the national physician fee schedule replacing the scheduled 10 cut to the physician fee reimbursement rate with a 05 increase through june 30 2008 and maintaining through june 30 2008 the ability of independent clinical laboratories to bill medicare directly for the technical component of certain pathology services provided to hospitals we expect that congress will take up the issue of the fee schedules again in 2008 and we cannot predict whether they will change if medicare fee schedules are reduced or if independent clinical laboratories are prohibited from billing medicare directly for the technical component of pathology services provided to hospitals it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

average medicare reimbursement is not materially different than our overall average reimbursement rate from other third party fee for service payers despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare and medicaid programs we continue to participate in such programs because we believe that our other business may depend in part on continued participation in these programs since certain customers may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical testing services regardless of who pays for such services 

we are generally permitted to bill medicare beneficiaries directly for statutorily excluded clinical testing services an advance beneficiary notice “abn” is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patient’s informed decision to personally assume financial liability for clinical tests which are likely to be denied and not reimbursed by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically necessary these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by medicare if a medicare beneficiary signs an abn we are also generally permitted to bill the 

beneficiary for clinical tests that medicare does not cover due to “medical necessity” limitations we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the physician’s office staff who must obtain the abn on our behalf if the abn is not timely provided to the beneficiary or is not completed properly we may end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient if payment is denied by medicare due to coverage limitations cms is currently considering potential changes to rules regarding abn’s that may effectively increase the number of tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient 

clinical laboratories that bill medicare or medicaid could be excluded from participation in any federal healthcare programs if it is determined that they have submitted bills or requests from payment for items or services substantially in excess of the laboratory’s usual charges for such items or services without good cause the department of health and human services office of inspector general has periodically proposed to define the terms “substantially in excess” and “usual charges” but has not done so 

cms is permitted to adjust statutorily prescribed fees for clinical test services if the standard rules by which those payments are calculated will result in fees that are “grossly excessive” cms rules set forth a process and factors for establishing a “realistic and equitable” payment amount for clinical test services under medicare part b and services paid under a prospective payment system if existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be considered unreasonable if they are either grossly excessive or deficient under cms rules if cms or a carrier determines that an overall payment adjustment of less than 15 is needed to produce a realistic and equitable payment amount then the payment amount is not considered “grossly excessive or deficient” however if a determination is made that a payment adjustment of 15 or more is justified cms could provide an adjustment of less than 15 but not more than 15 in any given year fees payable by medicare could be reduced prospectively as a result of the application of these rules 

historically most medicare and medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare and medicaid programs directly administered by the federal government over the last several years the federal government has sponsored programs to expand private health insurance options for medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs called “medicare advantage” programs there has been rapid growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these plans in recent years in an effort to control costs states also have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements if these efforts continue to be successful we may experience a further shift of traditional medicare and medicaid beneficiaries to private health insurance options 

  reduced utilization of clinical testing government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical test services medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients 

  medicare administrative contractors historically many different local intermediaries administered medicare part a and many different local carriers administered medicare part b which covers services provide by independent clinical laboratories carriers often had inconsistent policies on matters such as 1 test coverage 2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims documentation and 5 fee schedules subject to the national fee schedule limitations inconsistent carrier rules and policies increase the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories federal law requires medicare contracting reform all historic intermediaries and carriers are being replaced using a competitive bidding process with medicare administrative contractors who will handle both part a and part b approximately one half of the medicare administrative contractors have been selected it is expected that the revised system when completed will reduce the administrative complexity of billing for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 

  competitive bidding cms is required to conduct a demonstration project to determine whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for medicare beneficiaries at fees below current medicare payment rates while maintaining quality and access to care cms will conduct two separate demonstrations in isolated markets the first will be conducted in the metropolitan statistical area composed of the san diegocarlsbadsan marcos california area beginning in 2008 under a plan announced by cms in december 2007 bids were due february 15 2008 winners will be selected in april 2008 and the pilot will begin july 1 2008 cms has not yet identified the site of the second competitive bidding demonstration project 

the industry remains concerned about the general lack of responsiveness by cms to industry concerns and questions regarding the demonstration project and continues discussing with members of congress and committee staffs industry concerns regarding quality patient access and cms’ flawed implementation of the demonstration project we believe that clinical testing services are not commodities and that the quality of services and access to those services could be adversely impacted by implementation of competitive bidding in an effort to delay or stop the demonstration project 

the company other industry participants and several professional societies are supporting a complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of california in january 2008 on behalf of three local laboratories 

president bush recently proposed a fiscal 2009 federal budget that includes savings of approximately 24 billion over five years by establishing competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services provided to medicare beneficiaries if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical testing it could materially adversely affect the clinical testing industry and us 

regulation 

the company’s business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations including inspections and audits by governmental agencies in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which the company engages in business we also must comply with other laws and regulations including in the united states and in the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business that apply to conducting business generally eg the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws of other jurisdictions set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to the company’s business 

  clia and state clinical laboratory licensing regulations all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the appropriate federal and state agencies the clinical laboratories improvement amendments of 1988 “clia” regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing state laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for each test before approval for use or marketing of services 

  fraud and abuse rules federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs the penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines criminal and civil penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs several states have similar laws 

in addition federal and state antiselfreferral laws generally prohibit medicare and medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory many states have similar antiselfreferral and other laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians 

under federal regulations implementing safe harbors to the federal antikickback laws and exceptions to the federal antiselfreferral laws certain donors but not laboratories may provide eprescribing items and services to referral sources at no charge and a broader range of donors including laboratories may provide a broader range of electronic health records information technology software and services including eprescribing conditioned on the recipient’s payment of at least fifteen percent 15 of the cost of the donated software and services and compliance with other conditions 

  drug testing the substance abuse and mental health services administration “samhsa” regulates drug testing for public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses all laboratories that perform such testing must be certified as meeting samhsa’s detailed performance and quality standards all of our laboratories that perform such testing are so certified 

  controlled substances the federal drug enforcement administration “dea” regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugsofabuse testing in the united states to obtain access to controlled substances laboratories must be licensed by the dea all of our laboratories in the united states that use controlled substances are licensed by the dea 

  medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical laboratories in the united states are subject to federal state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of such waste and contractually require 

them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

  fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories in the united states the fda also regulates testing that we perform for clinical trials drugsofabuse testing for employers testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratorydeveloped tests but it has stated that it is exercising enforcement discretion in not regulating most laboratorydeveloped tests performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories however the fda may be changing its stance regarding a subset of laboratorydeveloped tests the fda has issued a guidance document still in draft form describing certain laboratorydeveloped tests that fda calls “in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays” that the fda may regulate as medical devices if the fda regulates these tests as medical devices it can impose extensive requirements on them and the laboratories that offer this subset of laboratorydeveloped tests many of the esoteric tests that we develop internally are first offered as laboratorydeveloped tests fda regulation of a subset of laboratorydeveloped tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing would lead to increased regulatory burden and additional costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests and may prevent us from marketing certain new products or services the fda also recently finalized a guidance document relating to analyte specific reagents which could restrict laboratory access to certain products now available or increase the costs of those products if in response to its adoption manufacturers voluntarily withdraw their products from the market 

our diagnostic product business is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing distribution and market surveillance of diagnostic products prior to marketing or selling most diagnostic products currently we are required to secure clearance or approval from the fda and when appropriate counterpart nonus regulatory agencies although the ivdd allows us to market in europe many products using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us such as fines product suspensions submission of warning letters recalls product seizures injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions where appropriate voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls may be undertaken 

  occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health administration “osha” has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the united states this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick injuries 

  transportation for purposes of transportation most clinical laboratory specimens and some laboratory supplies are considered hazardous materials subject to regulation by the department of transportation the public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association 

  corporate practice of medicine many states including some in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine in certain states business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation these rules vary from state to state the manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the state in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these states to oversee the practice of medicine in some states anatomic pathology services are delivered through physicianowned entities that employ the practicing pathologists 

  contracts and relationships with physicians in our anatomic pathology business we employ pathologists many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement these agreements have varying terms but generally can be terminated at any time upon advance notice most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment the agreements may be subject to limitations under state law that may limit the enforceability of these covenants 

our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice if they provide inpatient services they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital with privileges in pathology 

  feesplitting some states restrict the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and nonphysicians these laws may apply to some of the arrangements that we have with pathologists the laws vary from state to state 

  privacy and security of health information standard transactions pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa federal regulators have issued regulations regarding protecting the privacy and security of certain healthcare information and standards for electronic healthcare transactions in the united states 

the privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including 

 we have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy regulations which restrict our ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable healthcare information without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes we also must comply with more stringent state laws where such laws exist in addition for healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries we need to comply with the laws of those other countries 

the hipaa security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding electronic patient information we have implemented policies and standards to comply with these regulations the hipaa electronic transactions regulations establish uniform standards for electronic transactions and code sets including the electronic transactions and code sets used for billing claims remittance advices enrollment and eligibility we have completed conversion to the required standard format for our electronic feeforservice claim transactions and our electronic feeforservice remittance transactions 

hipaa regulations on adoption of national provider identifiers require healthcare providers to adopt new unique identifiers for reporting on claims transactions we are completing compliance with these regulations by obtaining the required information from our physician clients and expect that the process will continue through 2008 

  compliance we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations applicable to us however including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices the applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science and healthcare technology such occurrences regardless of their outcome could among other things 

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statues regulations and other laws including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

the federal or state governments may bring claims based on theories as to our current practices that we believe are lawful the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a non 

compliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 17 of our net revenues during 2007 we believe that based on our experience with government settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its position on health fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to health fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse 

we have a longstanding and wellestablished compliance program the quality safety  compliance committee of our board of directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program our program emphasizes the development of training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations we conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures

this report also includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks or uncertainties our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks we face described below and elsewhere see “cautionary factors that may affect future results” on page 27 

the clinical testing business is highly competitive and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of clinical test providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other independent clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we also compete with anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices hospitals generally maintain onsite laboratories to perform testing on their patients inpatient or outpatient in addition many hospitals compete with independent clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality of service our failure to provide a broad test menu or service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to compete effectively our business could be adversely affected and our net revenues and profitability could be damaged 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid have taken steps to control the utilization and pricing of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and pricing for clinical testing services 

from time to time congress has legislated reductions in or frozen updates to the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule in addition cms has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform we also are subject to congressional mandates such as a mandate for medicare to conduct a demonstration project to determine whether competitive bidding for clinical test services can reduce costs without adversely impacting quality and beneficiary access to services we also provide physician services which are reimbursed by medicare under a physician fee schedule which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis cms changes add to our costs by increasing complexity and administrative requirements medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures 

in addition over the last several years the federal government has sponsored programs to expand private health insurance programs for medicare beneficiaries called “medicare advantage” programs and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs there has been rapid growth of health insurance plans offering medicare advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs also in recent years states have increasingly mandated that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements if these efforts continue to be successful we may experience a further shift of traditional medicare and medicaid beneficiaries to private health insurance options 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including changes in law or regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business 

healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and pricing of healthcare services including clinical test services 

we also face efforts by nongovernmental third party payers including healthcare insurance plans to reduce utilization and pricing for clinical testing services 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these healthcare insurance plans and independent physician associations may demand that clinical laboratories accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements in addition some healthcare insurance plans have been willing to limit the ppo or pos laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved feeforservice pricing there are also more patients in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient costsharing 

the increased consolidation among healthcare insurers also has increased the potential risk of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer 

we expect efforts to reduce reimbursements to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue these efforts including future changes in thirdparty payer rules practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare insurer may have a material adverse effect on our business 

business development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities such as strategic acquisitions licensing investments and alliances however these enhancement plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities moreover the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity and to integrate it into our business the success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities but also on the property resources efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners further disputes may arise with strategic partners due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests 

each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that previously operated independently and has different systems processes and cultures integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and potential adverse effects on operating results the process of combining companies may be disruptive to both of our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 in addition integration of clinical testing companies is further complicated because most clinical testing is performed under arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice thus an acquisition may result in a customer’s decision to stop using us for clinical testing 

if we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or a timely manner 

our business could be negatively affected if we are unable successfully to continue to improve our efficiency 

as noted above government payers and healthcare insurers have taken steps to control the utilization and pricing of healthcare services including clinical testing services and such steps may continue if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate these activities our business could be negatively affected 

adverse resolution of the investigation related to nid may cause us material losses and have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

nid and the company each received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york during the fourth quarter of 2004 the subpoenas requested a wide range of business records including documents regarding parathyroid hormone “pth” test kits manufactured by nid and pth testing performed by the company the company has voluntarily and actively cooperated with the investigation providing information witnesses and business records of nid and the company including documents related to pth tests and test kits as well as other tests and test kits in the second and third quarters of 2005 the fda conducted an inspection of nid and issued a form 483 listing the observations made by the fda during the course of the inspection nid responded to the form 483 

during the third quarter of 2007 the government and the company began settlement discussions in the course of those discussions the government has disclosed to the company certain of the government’s legal theories regarding the amount of damages allegedly incurred by the government which include alleged violations of civil and criminal statutes including the false claims act and the food drug and cosmetics act violations of these statutes and related regulations could lead to a warning letter injunction fines or penalties exclusion from federal health care programs andor criminal prosecution as well as claims by third parties the company has analyzed the government’s position and presented its own analysis which argued against many of the government’s claims in light of that analysis and based on the status of settlement discussions the company has established a reserve in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles reflected in discontinued operations of 241 million in connection with these claims of the total reserve 51 million and 190 million was recorded in the third and fourth quarters respectively of 2007 the company estimates that the amount reserved represents the minimum expected probable loss with respect to this matter the company does not believe that a reasonable estimate for these losses in excess of the established reserve can be made at this time the company has recorded a deferred tax benefit associated with that portion of the reserve that it expects will be tax deductible eventual losses related to these matters may substantially exceed the reserve and the impact could be material to the company’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition in the period that such matters are determined or paid 

the company continues to engage in discussions with the united states attorney’s office and those discussions potentially could lead to an agreement in principle to resolve some or all of the matters in the near future there can be no assurance however when or whether a settlement may be reached or as to its terms if the company cannot reach an acceptable settlement agreement with the united states attorney’s office the company would defend itself and nid and could incur significant costs in doing so 

we are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities and we may face substantial fines and penalties and our business activities may be impacted if we fail to comply 

the company’s business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the united states including at both the federal and state levels and the other jurisdictions in which the company engages in business while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts including those relating to 

 these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices we may not be able to maintain renew or secure required permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our business if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or if we fail to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses we could suffer civil and criminal penalties fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation could be damaged important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from governmental authorities we also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions 

relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our products and services and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 17 of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 regardless of merit or eventual outcome these types of investigations and related litigation can result in 

 although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations moreover even when an investigation is resolved favorably the process may be time consuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive 

changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted or subject our existing or proposed services and products to additional costs delay modification withdrawal or reconsideration such changes could require us to modify our business objectives and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

billing for clinical test services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and nonuniform rules and administrative requirements depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process further our billing systems require significant technology investment and as a result of marketplace demands we need to continually invest in our billing systems 

missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense we believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of or inaccurate billing information failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business opportunities 

information technology it systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including clinical testing test reporting billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems it systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures human acts and natural disasters moreover despite the security measures we have implemented our it systems may be subject to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems we also have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems nevertheless we may experience damages to our systems and system failures and interruptions 

in addition we are in the process of implementing standard laboratory information and billing systems which we expect will take several years to complete failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the 

implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

if we experience systems problems including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems they may interrupt our ability to operate for example the problems may impact our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform or bill for tests in a timely manner if our operations are interrupted it could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new tests technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business or increase our costs in addition they could introduce new tests that may result in a decrease in the demand for our tests or cause us to reduce the prices of our tests our success in continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to develop or introduce new tests we also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to develop and introduce or license new tests technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of an independent clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices although the clia compliance costs make it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare test equipment to physicians diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to both physicians and patients of test kits approved by the fda for pointofcare testing or home use development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our net revenues 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 34 billion of longterm debt outstanding except for outstanding letters of credit and operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s and moody’s investor services there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan would increase changes in our credit ratings however do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in this case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 

our people are a critical resource and competition for qualified employees is strong if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain key management personnel or qualified skilled technical or professional employees at our clinical laboratories research centers or manufacturing facilities the company’s earnings and revenues could be adversely affected in addition if we were to lose or to fail to attract and retain skilled pathologists with positive relationships with 

their respective local medical communities particularly those with subspecialties the company’s earnings and revenues could be adversely affected 

failure to establish and perform to appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation 

the provision of clinical testing services including anatomic pathology services and related services and the design manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks the services that we provide and the products that we design manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care therefore users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes 

manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events we may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospitalbased pathologists we are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation 

the failure of our it systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 

public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology hcit standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including test results could require costly modifications to our existing hcit systems while we do not expect hcit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing hcit standards we could lose customers and business opportunities 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not adequately secure information 

in our business we generate or maintain sensitive information such as patient data if we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it our business could be impaired and our reputation could suffer 

we are subject to numerous political legal operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways 

although we conduct most of our business in the us our expanding international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include without limitation 

 25 

international operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in local jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures 

we expect to expand further our international operations through acquisition or otherwise which would increase these risks as a result of these risks our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management’s attention from operations the proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation and decrease the demand for our services and products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid

 item 2 properties 

our executive offices are located in madison new jersey we maintain clinical testing laboratories in major metropolitan areas and elsewhere throughout the continental united states in several instances a joint venture of which we are a partner maintains the laboratory we also maintain offices a data center billing centers call centers an assembly center distribution centers and a clinical trials testing laboratory at locations throughout the united states in addition we maintain offices manufacturing facilities and clinical laboratories in locations outside the united states including in sweden puerto rico mexico the united kingdom india and australia our properties that are not owned are leased on terms and for durations that are reflective of commercial standards in the communities where these properties are located we believe that in general our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated future levels of operation and are adequately maintained we believe that if we were unable to renew a lease on any of our facilities we could find alternative space at competitive market rates and relocate our operations to such new location without material disruption to our business several of our principal facilities are highlighted below

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in addition to the matters described below in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a provider of diagnostic testing information and services these legal actions may include lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages and could have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

the company is also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding our business including among other matters operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these reviews investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the healthcare services industry including our company 

we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims 

the company contests liability or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations or proceedings are in the early stages we cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss if any related to such matters how or if such matters will be resolved when they ultimately will be resolved or what the eventual settlement fine penalty or other relief if any might be subject to the foregoing and except for the nid matter see also note 15 in “notes to consolidated financial statements” in part ii item 8 we believe based on current knowledge that the outcome of all other pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although the outcome of such matters could be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period that such matters are determined or paid depending on among other things the levels of our revenues or income for such period 

nid matter 

as previously disclosed nid a test kit manufacturing subsidiary and the company each received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york during the fourth quarter of 2004 the subpoenas requested a wide range of business records including documents regarding parathyroid hormone “pth” test kits manufactured by nid and pth testing performed by the company the company has voluntarily and actively cooperated with the investigation providing information witnesses and business records of nid and the company including documents related to pth tests and test kits as well as other tests and test kits in the second and third quarters of 2005 the fda conducted an inspection of nid and issued a form 483 listing the observations made by the fda during the course of the inspection nid responded to the form 483 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 nid instituted its second voluntary product hold within a sixmonth period due to quality issues which adversely impacted the operating performance of nid as a result the company evaluated a number of strategic options for nid and on april 19 2006 decided to cease operations at nid upon completion of the wind down of operations in the third quarter of 2006 the operations of nid were classified as discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2006 the government issued two additional subpoenas one to nid and one to the company the subpoenas covered various records including records related to tests and test kits in addition to pth 

during the third quarter of 2007 the government and the company began settlement discussions in the course of those discussions the government has disclosed to the company certain of the government’s legal theories regarding the amount of damages allegedly incurred by the government which include alleged violations of civil and criminal statutes including the false claims act and the food drug and cosmetics act violations of these statutes and related regulations could lead to a warning letter injunction fines or penalties exclusion from federal health care programs andor criminal prosecution as well as claims by third parties the company has analyzed the government’s position and presented its own analysis which argued against many of the government’s claims in light of that analysis and based on the status of settlement discussions the company has established a reserve in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles reflected in discontinued operations of 241 million in connection with these claims of the total reserve 51 million and 190 million was recorded in the third and fourth quarters respectively of 2007 the company estimates that the amount reserved represents the minimum expected probable loss with respect to this matter the company does not believe that a reasonable estimate for these losses in excess of the established reserve can be made at this time the company has recorded a deferred tax benefit associated with that portion of the reserve that it expects will be tax deductible eventual losses related to these matters may substantially exceed the reserve and the impact could be material to the company’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition in the period that such matters are determined or 

paid 

the company continues to engage in discussions with the united states attorney’s office and those discussions potentially could lead to an agreement in principle to resolve some or all of the matters in the near future there can be no assurance however when or whether a settlement may be reached or as to its terms if the company cannot reach an acceptable settlement agreement with the united states attorney’s office the company would defend itself and nid and could incur significant costs in doing so 

other matters

the united states clinical laboratory testing market 

clinical laboratory testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized as clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing clinical testing is performed on body fluids such as blood and urine anatomic pathology testing is performed on tissues including biopsies and other samples such as human cells many clinical laboratory tests are considered routine and can be performed by most commercial clinical laboratories tests that are not routine and that require more sophisticated equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric tests esoteric tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that specialize in performing those tests 

we estimate that the united states clinical laboratory testing market had approximately 45 billion in annual revenues in 2006 most laboratory tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories in 2006 we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories accounted for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

orders for laboratory testing are generated from physician offices hospitals and employers as such factors including changes in the united states economy which can affect the number of unemployed and uninsured and design changes in healthcare plans which impact the number of physician office and hospital visits can impact the utilization of laboratory testing 

the diagnostic testing industry remains fragmented and highly competitive government payers such as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and medicaid which principally serves indigent patients as well as private payers and large employers continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical laboratory services we expect reductions in reimbursement from medicare and medicaid will continue to be implemented from time to time the continuing consolidation among healthcare insurers has resulted in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories see “recent changes in payer relationships” and “payers and customers—healthcare insurers” 

while the diagnostic testing industry in the united states will be impacted by a number of factors and may continue to experience intensified pricing pressure in the near term we believe it will continue to grow over the long term as a result of the following 

the growing and aging population continuing research and development in the area of genomics the study of dna genes and chromosomes and proteomics the analysis of individual proteins and collections of proteins which is expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests increasing recognition by consumers and payers of the value of laboratory testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection and prevention and increasing affordability of and access to tests due to advances in technology and cost efficiencies quest diagnostics as the largest clinical laboratory testing company with a leading position in most of its domestic geographic markets and service offerings is well positioned to benefit from the longterm growth expected in the industry 

corporate strategy and growth opportunities 

our mission is to be the undisputed world leader in diagnostic testing information and services we focus on patients growth and people to help achieve our goals 

patients are at the center of everything we do increasingly patients and their doctors have a choice when it comes to selecting a healthcare provider and we strive to give them new and compelling reasons to put their trust in us we differentiate our company to patients and doctors by 

providing the highest quality services and a unique patient experience we strive to provide the highest quality in all that we do including phlebotomy and specimen transport services analytical testing processes in our laboratories accurate and timely lab reports and billing information we use six sigma and lean processes to continuously reduce defects enhance quality and further increase the efficiency of our operations six sigma is a management approach that utilizes a thorough understanding of customer needs and requirements root cause analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring to enhance quality lean streamlines processes and eliminates waste we also use six sigma and lean principles to help standardize operations and processes across our company and identify and adopt company best practices our phlebotomists are specially trained to provide a unique patient experience patients are served at our patient service centers within 20 minutes on average and even faster where we have deployed our automated appointment scheduling offering unparalleled access and distribution we offer the broadest test menu and national access to testing services with facilities in substantially all of the major metropolitan areas in the united states our test menu includes more than 3000 tests we operate a nationwide network of greater than 2100 of our own patient service centers principal laboratories located in more than 30 major metropolitan areas throughout the united states and about 150 smaller “rapid response” laboratories that enable us to serve patients physicians hospitals employers and other healthcare providers throughout the united states we also operate approximately 65 locations in the united states and canada where we provide paramedical examinations we believe that customers seek to utilize laboratorytesting providers that offer a comprehensive range of tests and services and the most convenient access to those services growth is driven organically and through acquisition over the long term we expect to grow organically at or above the industry growth rate by gaining more customers and selling more to existing customers historically our industry has focused primarily on service levels and aggressive pricing to drive organic volume growth we believe that the differentiation 

we are creating through our focus on six sigma quality unparalleled access and distribution the most comprehensive test menu and innovative test and information technology offerings provides us with a competitive advantage and enables us to compete on more than price alone additionally we are investing in sales and marketing providing the sales force with better tools and training and adding innovative new products to sell we are specifically focused on driving profitable organic growth in highergrowth areas by being a leading innovator our principal areas of focus include 

physician sub specialties while we provide a strong value proposition in routine and esoteric clinical testing we have not been the provider of choice for the testing needs of certain physician specialists during 2006 we enhanced our test menu and service capabilities to more effectively compete in several physician sub specialties including urology gastroenterology hematology and oncology where we have had a smaller market share we plan to continue to enhance our test menu and service capabilities in these areas as well as in dermatology we have also been enhancing our esoteric anatomic pathology capabilities and service offerings and have added specially trained sales representatives to service pathologists in hospitals as well as hematologyoncology offices innovation leadership we intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services as the industry leader with the largest and broadest network and the leading provider of esoteric testing we believe that we are the best partner for developers of new technologies and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace through our relationships with the academic community pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms and emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we believe that we are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovation to the market our innovation activities are focused on genebased and other esoteric testing capabilities we intend to remain a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technologies and services we believe that genebased and other esoteric tests are the fastest growing area within the diagnostic testing industry we believe that we have the largest genebased and esoteric testing business in the united states with over 1 billion in net revenues during 2006 and that this business is growing approximately 10 per year we believe that the unveiling of the human genome and the linkages of genes and the proteins they produce with disease will result in more complex and thorough predictive and diagnostic testing we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this growth we intend to focus on commercializing diagnostic applications of discoveries in the areas of functional genomics and proteomics information technology we continue to invest in the development and improvement of information technology products for customers and healthcare providers we develop differentiated products that provide more convenient ordering and reporting of laboratory tests and better access to patientcentric information we believe that these products enhance the value we provide to our customers and result in increased customer loyalty our care360 ™ products including our care360 physician portal enable doctors to order diagnostic tests and review laboratory results from quest diagnostics online in addition the care360 physician portal enables doctors to electronically prescribe medication view clinical and administrative information from various sources file certain documents into a patientcentric health record maintained in our repository and share confidential information with medical colleagues in a manner consistent with the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the care360 physician portal and related care360 products allow us to replace older technology products used by some physicians and thereby offer a better solution demand has been growing for our information technology solutions as physicians have expanded their usage of the internet by the end of 2006 over 100000 physicians were using our care360 ™ products and approximately 50 of our orders and over 90 of our test results were being transmitted via the internet the care360 physician portal was developed by medplus our wholly owned healthcare information technology subsidiary medplus’ chartmaxx ® patient record systems and care360 connectivity system are designed to support the creation and management of electronic patient records by bringing together in one patientcentric view information from various sources including physician’s records and laboratory and hospital data we intend to expand the services offered through our portal over time through both internal development and the formation of strategic relationships near patient testing also known as point of care testing technology changes are enabling testing to move closer to the patient and are becoming increasingly available and reliable we are well positioned to offer choice and integrated solutions to physicians hospitals clinics and retail customers for the testing methods that are most appropriate for each patient and practice we intend to acquire and develop novel technology platforms and systems to meet the needs of our clients we also intend to provide electronic data links through our care360 desktop 3 

system so that tests performed outside our central laboratories near the patient will be available for electronic medical records and will display in similar format to tests performed in our centralized laboratories this will differentiate our near patient testing products from other products that are not integrated into our customers’ electronic records since july 2006 we have made several acquisitions that enable us to serve this near patient testing market including hemocue focus diagnostics and enterix see “recent acquisitions” we believe that these acquisitions and our overall near patient strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment we will consider additional acquisitions or exclusive licenses of selective products to complement the products and services we provide acquisitions and international expansion the clinical laboratory industry in the united states remains fragmented we expect to continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of domestic clinical laboratories that can be integrated into our existing laboratories thereby increasing access for patients and enabling us to reduce costs and improve efficiencies while over the long term we believe positive industry factors in the us diagnostic testing industry and the differentiated services we offer to our customers will enable us to grow organically we see a number of opportunities to grow beyond our current principal business of operating diagnostic testing laboratories in the united states we are actively exploring opportunities including acquisitions in the area of near patient testing to augment our laboratory testing business given that physicians and hospitals are primary sources for both near patient testing and laboratory performed tests we believe providing both services will strengthen our relationships with customers and accelerate our growth additionally we see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic testing to international markets particularly developing countries where the testing markets are highly fragmented and less mature in addition expansion into near patient testing and international markets will diversify our revenue base and add businesses which are growing faster and are more profitable than our principal business of us based clinical laboratory testing people enable us to realize our mission in this regard an important challenge is to prepare our workforce for the future our people strategy is built on concepts of stringent employee selection effective engagement and ongoing development resulting in a staff of highly qualified and motivated employees who are committed to our goals in addition we are committed to improving the health of our employees and reducing healthcare costs for them and our company through our healthyquest initiative we provide employees with the opportunity to lose weight quit smoking and generally pursue healthier lifestyles quest diagnostics is recognized as a “best place to work” in numerous locales as a consequence of our workplace initiatives that reflect our belief that people are our most important asset we take diversity seriously believing that our organization should reasonably reflect the communities that we serve we strive to make all of our employees effective ambassadors of our company 

recent acquisitions 

on january 31 2007 we acquired poct holding ab “hemocue” a company headquartered in angelholm sweden that specializes in near patient testing in an allcash transaction valued at approximately 420 million including 123 million of assumed debt of hemocue hemocue which has annualized revenues of approximately 90 million is the leading global provider in near patient testing for hemoglobin with a growing share in the near patient markets for professional glucose and microalbumin testing hemocue’s handheld systems are used in physician’s offices blood banks hospitals diabetes clinics and public health clinics in developing countries these systems are used as the primary means to screen for anemia the measurement of hemoglobin is important for patients being treated by transfusion or undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy where instant test results can lead to immediate treatment decisions approximately 50 of hemocue’s products are sold outside the united states hemocue has a strong product development pipeline based on its pioneering use of its patented microfluidic systems and is currently developing new tests including one to determine white blood cell counts this test will help physicians quickly determine the presence of an infection and consequently the need for antibiotic treatment potentially reducing the overuse of antibiotics an ongoing public health concern in addition we intend to make hemocue’s near patient handheld systems compatible with our care360 portal which enables doctors to store access and share patient information we financed the purchase price through a 450 million oneyear term loan 

in september 2006 we acquired enterix inc “enterix” an australiabased company in an allcash transaction valued at approximately 44 million enterix manufactures the insure ™ fecal immunochemical test for screening for colorectal cancer and also performs the insure ™ test for patients prior to the acquisition we were the exclusive clinical laboratory offering the insure ™ test in the united states during 2007 we intend to release a version of the test that can be performed by physicians in their offices 

on july 3 2006 we acquired focus diagnostics inc “focus diagnostics” in an allcash transaction valued at 208 million including approximately 3 million of assumed debt focus diagnostics is a leading provider of infectious and immunologic disease testing and has established a reputation for being first to introduce new assays to the market including diagnostic tests for lyme disease west nile virus and sars in addition focus diagnostics develops manufactures and markets diagnostic products such as herpeselect® elisa tests that detect patient antibodies to specific types of herpes simplex virus which can be performed on a variety of instrument platforms subject to clearance by the food and drug administration “fda” we plan to introduce within the next year a near patient testing device that will allow physician office laboratories to rapidly detect antibodies against herpes simplex virus type 2 focus diagnostics offers its reference testing services and sells its diagnostic products to large academic medical centers hospitals and commercial laboratories focus diagnostics’ facility is located in cypress california approximately 27 of focus diagnostics’ products are sold outside the united states 

we believe that the acquisition of hemocue focus diagnostics and enterix support our growth strategy by establishing a platform to serve the near patient testing market we expect to use hemocue’s distribution network for sales of our complementary products including enterix’s near patient test for colorectal cancer screening and focus diagnostics’ near patient product for herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies as well as other diagnostic products that we develop we also plan to investigate the potential applications of research conducted at focus diagnostics to hemocue’s device platform in addition to adding new product development capabilities the acquisition of focus diagnostics further solidifies our leading position in providing esoteric testing for hospitals and commercial laboratories by adding focus diagnostics’ infectious and immunologic disease testing services to our menu 

on november 1 2005 we acquired lab one  inc “labone” in a transaction valued at approximately 947 million including approximately 138 million of assumed debt of labone labone provides health screening and risk assessment services to life insurance companies as well as clinical diagnostic testing services to healthcare providers and drugsofabuse testing to employers labone operates regional laboratories in lenexa kansas and cincinnati ohio as well as a stateoftheart call center in lee’s summit missouri and provides paramedical examination services throughout the united states and canada to serve the life insurance industry the acquisition of labone supports our growth strategy in a number of ways including solidifying our leadership position in diagnostic testing by expanding access for physicians and patients and giving us added presence in several geographic areas strengthening our drugsofabuse testing business and establishing us as the leader in a new testingrelated business providing health screening and risk assessment services to the life insurance industry 

recent changes in payer relationships 

on october 3 2006 we announced that we would not be a national contracted provider of laboratory services to united healthcare group inc “unh” beginning january 1 2007 after negotiating with unh and offering to substantially reduce their total costs for laboratory services unh demanded that we execute an agreement that would have significantly reduced fees from what we had offered and would have given unh the right to unilaterally dictate certain key terms over a period of up to eight years we determined that in the long term signing such an agreement would not be in the best interest of our company and our shareholders 

unh accounted for approximately 7 of our net revenues in 2006 with some of our regional laboratories having concentrations as high as 15 to 20 as one of many contracted providers we estimate that we served approximately half of unh’s members or approximately three times as many as our single largest competitor we believe that this was because physicians and patients preferred using us due to quality and convenience while we expect to continue to service unh’s members in certain limited markets as a contracted provider and in other markets as a noncontracted provider unh has threatened physicians with penalties if they continue to send laboratory testing to a noncontracted provider as of march 1 2007 we believe unh’s actions are unprecedented and inappropriate because they effectively eliminate the choice to use an outofnetwork provider which is embedded in many of the products unh sells and which employers and patients paid for in addition unh has been aggressively communicating to its members that they may be faced with higher copayments and deductibles if they use an outofnetwork laboratory while we retained virtually all of our unh business through december 31 2006 we estimate that by february 16 2007 about 60 of our direct unh business has moved to various contracted providers we currently expect that the vast majority of the work we perform for unh members will move to contracted providers before the end of 2007 however it is possible that if patients and physicians are sufficiently dissatisfied with the services they receive from providers unh is requiring them to use we may regain some of the lost business 

in most cases when we perform testing for unh members as a noncontracted provider we are entitled to reimbursement and unh is required to pay for our services often at rates in excess of what we were previously reimbursed however we expect unh may challenge our rights to reimbursement in certain cases leading to disputes which will take time to resolve and could result in a temporary increase in days sales outstanding unh may also decide to remit payment to patients for the services we provide them as a noncontracted provider requiring us to pursue the patient for collection pursuing collections from patients 

generally requires more effort and is more costly than collecting from a healthcare insurer and carries greater collection risk therefore if we are required to collect from patients rather than unh we could experience higher collection costs and bad debt on the work we perform as a noncontracted provider we plan to aggressively assert and defend our rights to appropriate reimbursement and challenge certain of unh’s actions on a number of fronts in addition we are educating patients their physicians and employers that there are important differences between laboratory testing providers and that their right to choose their testing provider should not be eliminated by inappropriate methods 

our current expectation is that no longer being a contracted provider to uhn and becoming a noncontracted provider to horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey which accounted for approximately 1 of our net revenues in 2006 will reduce our revenue growth in 2007 by between 7 and 10 most of that resulting from the direct loss of previously contracted work and some of it associated with the loss of other work from physicians who choose to consolidate their testing with a single laboratory given that we expect a decrease in volume levels in 2007 due to these contract changes we plan to adjust our cost structure to match the new volume levels however due to the fact that a large portion of our costs approximately 40 or more are fixed we do not expect our cost reduction actions will fully mitigate the profit impact of the anticipated volume decline during 2007 our plans also include examining our structural or fixed costs to determine what reductions can be made the extent to which we will need to reduce structural costs which in part will be driven by how quickly we replace lost business will determine how long it will take to complete all of our cost actions as we do so top priorities will be maintaining the differentiated level of service we provide to our patients and physicians and remaining positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities 

our services 

for 2006 our clinical laboratory testing business accounted for approximately 92 of our net revenues with the balance derived from risk assessment services clinical trials testing healthcare information technology services and diagnostic products substantially all of our services are provided within the united states see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements laboratory testing includes routine testing and genebased and esoteric testing which generated approximately 76 and 16 respectively of our net revenues risk assessment services generated approximately 5 of our net revenues and clinical trials testing generated approximately 3 of our net revenues we derive approximately 2 of our net revenues from foreign operations 

routine testing 

routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include 

blood cholesterol level blood chemistries complete blood cell counts pap tests urinalyses pregnancy and other prenatal tests alcohol and other substanceabuse tests and asthma and allergy tests such as the immunocap® test we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories rapid response laboratories and patient service centers we also perform routine testing at the hospital laboratories we manage major laboratories offer a full line of routine clinical tests rapid response laboratories are smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times patient service centers are facilities where specimens are collected and are typically located in or near a building used by medical professionals 

we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most routine tests within 24 hours the majority of test results are delivered electronically 

esoteric testing 

esoteric tests are those tests that require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials professional “handson” attention from highly skilled and technical personnel and that may be performed less frequently than routine tests because it is not costeffective for most hospital and clinical laboratories to perform lowvolume esoteric testing inhouse they generally refer many of these tests to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory that specializes in performing these more complex tests due to their complexity esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests 

our two esoteric testing laboratories which conduct business as quest diagnostics nichols institute are among the leading esoteric clinical testing laboratories in the world in 1998 our esoteric testing laboratory in san juan capistrano california was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve international organization for standardization or iso 9001 certification our esoteric testing laboratory in chantilly virginia enables us to provide full esoteric testing services on the east coast our focus diagnostics laboratory which is based in cypress california is one of the leading providers of infectious and immunologic disease testing in the world our esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of esoteric tests that are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories these esoteric tests are generally in the following fields 

endocrinology and metabolism the study of glands their hormone secretions and their effects on body growth and metabolism genetics the study of chromosomes genes and their protein products and effects hematology the study of blood and bone marrow cells and coagulation the process of blood clotting immunogenetics and human leukocyte antigens hla solid organ and bone marrow transplantation eligibility for vaccines and immunotherapy immunology the study of the immune system including antibodies immune system cells and their effects and autoimmune diseases microbiology and infectious diseases the study of microscopic forms of life including parasites bacteria viruses fungi and other infectious agents oncology the study of abnormal cell growth including benign tumors and cancer serology a science dealing with body fluids and their analysis including antibodies proteins and other characteristics and toxicology the study of chemicals and drugs and their effects on the body’s metabolism new test introductions 

we intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce new diagnostic tests as the industry leader with the largest and broadest laboratory network and the leading provider of esoteric testing we believe that we are the best partner for developers of new technology and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we continue to be a leading innovator in the industry through tests that we developed at quest diagnostics nichols institute the largest provider of molecular diagnostic testing in the united states and focus diagnostics a leading provider of infectious and immunologic disease testing as well as through relationships with technology developers we believe that we are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovations to the market through our relationships with the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms as well as through collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies 

we focus our resources on key disease states and technologies that will help doctors care for their patients through better screening diagnosis prognosis treatment choice and monitoring with these priorities in mind during 2006 we introduced over 80 new and improved assays and services principally in the following areas 

 we are working on the automation of a genetic test to determine whether parents are carriers of the genetic mutation that causes fragile x syndrome the most common form of inherited mental retardation this automation which is expected to be ready by mid 2007 will enable broadbased population screening for fragile x 

we proactively search for new opportunities in screening diagnosis prognosis treatment choice and treatment monitoring we believe that the unveiling of the human genome and its extension into proteomics and epigenetics will 

continue to result in ever more complex and thorough predictive and diagnostic testing we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these advances 

as testing methods become more complex we believe that it is also important to provide sound medical and scientific consultation to ensure the correct application and interpretation of the test results our medical and scientific directors are always available for consultation to our customers in 2006 we further enhanced our consultation programs with our enhanced reporting initiatives particularly in the complex areas of hematopathology and coagulation we believe consultation services will provide greater support and will help spur the adoption of the new tests we develop and lead to improved client satisfaction and improved patient outcomes 

anatomic pathology 

we are one of the leading providers of anatomic pathology services in the united states we have traditionally been strongest in cytology specifically in the analysis of pap tests to detect cervical cancer we led the industry in converting pap testing to the use of liquidbased technology a more effective means of screening for cervical cancer we have also introduced computerized pap screening which improves the accuracy of the cervical cytology report by decreasing the number of false negative and false positive results when compared to manual screening of a liquid based pap test alone we are among those leading the industry in educating physicians about human papilloma virus “hpv” molecular testing the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the american cancer society recommend that women over 30 should be screened for hpv in addition to a pap test anatomic pathology services and cytology services generated approximately 10 of our net revenues during 2006 

risk assessment services 

we believe that we are the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in the united states our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life insurance industry including teleunderwriting specimen collection and paramedical examinations laboratory testing medical record retrieval motor vehicle reports telephone inspections and credit checks the laboratory tests performed and data gathered by us are specifically designed to assist an insurance company in objectively evaluating the mortality and morbidity risks posed by policy applicants the majority of the testing is performed on specimens of individual life insurance policy applicants but also includes specimens of individuals applying for medical and disability policies we also provide risk assessment services in canada we operate approximately 65 locations in the united states and canada where we provide paramedical examinations we also contract with third parties for these services at 160 locations across the united states 

clinical trials testing 

we believe that we are the world’s second largest provider of clinical laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs through our focus diagnostics subsidiary we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on vaccines clinical research trials are required by the fda and other international regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs and vaccines we have clinical trials testing centers in the united states and in the united kingdom we also provide clinical trials testing in australia china singapore and south africa through arrangements with third parties clinical trials involving new drugs are increasingly being performed both inside and outside the united states approximately 53 of our net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2006 represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc or gsk we are the primary provider of testing to support gsk’s clinical trials testing requirements worldwide 

other services and products 

our medplus subsidiary is a developer and integrator of clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare organizations physicians and clinicians primarily through its chartmaxx ® electronic medical record system for hospitals and our care360 suite of products the care360 physician portal was developed by medplus and enables physicians to order diagnostic tests and review laboratory results from quest diagnostics online in addition the care360 physician portal enables physicians to electronically prescribe medications view clinical and administrative information from multiple sources file certain documents into a patientcentric health record maintained in our repository and share confidential patient information with medical colleagues in a manner that is consistent with hipaa privacy and security requirements 

see “recent acquisitions” for information concerning our recent acquisitions of hemocue focus diagnostics and enterix 

during the third quarter of 2006 we discontinued the operations of nichols institute diagnostics which manufactured and marketed diagnostic test kits and systems primarily for esoteric testing 

payers and customers 

we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers we consider a “payer” as the party that reimburses us for the test and a “customer” as the party who refers the test to us depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 2 the patient or 3 a third party who pays the bill for the patient such as an insurance company medicare or medicaid some states including new york new jersey and rhode island prohibit us from billing physician clients 

the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the percentage of our total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical laboratory testing business during 2006 applicable to each payer group 

 healthcare insurers including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers which typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for clinical laboratory testing services performed represent approximately onehalf of our consolidated net revenues from clinical laboratory testing during 2006 only three healthcare insurers including unh accounted for 5 or more of our net revenues reimbursement from these three largest payers totaled approximately 19 of our net revenues in 2006 unh which accounted for approximately 7 of our net revenues for 2006 was our largest payer 

during 2006 no single customer accounted for more than 15 of our consolidated net revenues we believe that the loss of any one of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

physicians 

physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical laboratory testing volume testing referred by physicians is typically billed to healthcare insurers government programs such as medicare and medicaid patients and physicians physicians are typically billed on a feeforservice basis based on negotiated fee schedules fees billed to patients and healthcare insurers are based on the laboratory’s patient fee schedule subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the healthcare insurers or with physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities 

healthcare insurers 

healthcare insurers including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers which typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories on behalf of their members represent approximately onehalf of our total clinical testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues from our clinical testing larger healthcare insurers typically prefer to use large commercial clinical laboratories because they can provide services to their members on a national or regional basis in addition larger laboratories are better able to achieve the lowcost structures necessary to profitably service the members of large healthcare plans and can provide test utilization data across various products in a consistent format healthcare insurers frequently require test utilization data in order to meet the reporting requirements of the national committee for quality assurance to implement disease management programs and for other health plan operation purposes in certain markets such as california healthcare insurers may delegate their covered members to independent physician associations or ipas which in turn negotiate with laboratories for clinical laboratory services on behalf of their members 

the trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers has continued resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these healthcare insurers as well as ipas demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements under these capitated payment arrangements we and healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of the healthcare insurer’s plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us some services such as various esoteric tests new technologies and anatomic pathology services may be carved out from a capitated rate and if carved out are charged on a feeforservice basis we work closely with healthcare insurers as they evaluate new tests however as innovation in the testing area increases there is no guarantee that healthcare insurers will agree to offer the technology as a covered service carve out these services or reimburse them at rates that reflect the true cost or value associated with such services our cost to perform work reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements is not materially different from our cost to perform work reimbursed under other arrangements with healthcare insurers since average reimbursement rates under capitated payment arrangements are typically less than our overall average reimbursement rate the testing services reimbursed under capitated payment arrangements are generally less profitable in 2006 we derived approximately 16 of our testing volume and 7 of our net revenues from capitated payment arrangements 

healthcare plans are increasingly offering programs such as preferred provider organizations or ppos and consumer driven health plans that offer a greater choice of healthcare providers pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements most of our agreements with major healthcare insurers are nonexclusive arrangements as a result under these nonexclusive arrangements physicians and patients have more freedom of choice in selecting laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on the basis of service and quality than they may otherwise if consumer driven plans and ppo plans increase in popularity it will be increasingly important for healthcare providers to differentiate themselves based on quality service and convenience to avoid competing on price alone 

despite the general trend of increased choice for patients in selecting a healthcare provider recent experience indicates that some healthcare insurers may actively seek to limit the choice of patients and physicians if they feel it will give them increased leverage to negotiate lower fees by consolidating services with a single or limited network of contracted providers historically healthcare insurers which had limited their network of laboratory service providers encouraged their members and sometimes offered incentives to utilize only contracted providers in addition patients who use a noncontracted provider may have a higher coinsurance responsibility which may result in physicians referring testing to contracted providers to minimize the expense to their patients in cases where members choose to use a noncontracted provider due to service quality or convenience the noncontracted provider would be reimbursed at rates considered “reasonable and customary” contracted rates are generally lower than “reasonable and customary” rates because of the potential for greater volume as a contracted provider however a noncontracted laboratory service provider with quality and service preferred by physicians and patients to that of contracted providers could potentially realize greater profits than if it was a contracted provider provided that physicians and patients continue to have choice in selecting their provider physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical laboratory testing volume and often refer work to us as a noncontracted provider recent experience indicates that at least one large healthcare insurer unh is looking to restrict or eliminate the choice of physicians and in turn their patients by threatening to impose financial penalties on physicians for referring patients to noncontracted laboratory service providers if this approach is successful in influencing physicians to no longer use noncontracted laboratories it could make it substantially more difficult for a laboratory service provider to sufficiently differentiate itself based on quality and service in order to profitably operate as a noncontracted provider could lead to other healthcare insurers using similar tactics and could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historically most medicare beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare program but the federal government has over the last several years effected various proposals in an effort to increase enrollment of medicare beneficiaries in the private managed care system with the enactment of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma which renamed the private medicare program “medicare advantage” and created an additional product that allows for regional preferred provider organization it is possible that we may begin to experience a shift of traditional medicare beneficiaries to private medicare advantage programs 

we offer questnet ™  a service whereby we develop and administer customized networks of clinical laboratory providers for healthcare insurers through questnet ™  physicians and patients are provided multiple choices for clinical laboratory testing while healthcare insurers realize cost reductions from reducing testing performed by noncontracted providers and simplified administration of payment for clinical laboratory testing services 

hospitals 

hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing are typically negotiated on behalf of the hospitals by group purchasing organizations we believe that most hospital laboratories perform approximately 90 to 95 of their patients’ clinical laboratory tests we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states that vary from esoteric testing to helping manage their laboratories we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals our hospital customers account for approximately 11 of our net revenues the majority of which represents services billed to the hospitals for certain testing that the hospitals do not perform internally hospitals continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity through test internalization as well as competing with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory hospitals can have greater leverage with healthcare insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories particularly hospitals that have a significant market share hospitals thus are frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with healthcare insurers than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical laboratory testing services 

we have dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique needs of hospital customers we believe that the combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals for consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be a partner of choice for hospital customers 

we have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships we also manage the laboratories at a number of other hospitals 

employers governmental institutions and other clinical laboratories 

we provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and to large employers we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical laboratory testing to employers for drugs of abuse we also provide wellness testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in improving their health testing services for employers account for approximately 3 of our net revenues the volume of testing services for employers which generally have relatively low profit margins decreased slightly in 2006 due to our no longer serving certain lowpriced business and some reduction in hiring activity among some large retail customers we also perform esoteric testing services for other commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities all of these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

sales and marketing 

we market to and service our customers through our direct sales force healthplan sales force customer service representatives and couriers 

we focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable accounts we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and profitability of all accounts 

our sales force is organized by customer type with the majority of representatives focused on marketing clinical laboratory testing and related services to physicians including specialty physicians such as oncologists urologists and gastroenterologists additionally we have a healthplan sales organization that focuses on regional and national insurance and healthcare organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on meeting the unique needs of hospitals and promotes the specialized capabilities of our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratories and our focus diagnostics infectious and immunologic disease testing laboratory supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex tests a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling substanceofabuse and wellness testing to employers we also have a sales force that focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to life insurance companies with the completion of our acquisition of hemocue and focus diagnostics we also have a sales force that will focus on selling products to hospitals commercial clinical laboratories and physician office laboratories 

customer service representatives perform a number of services for patients and customers they monitor services answer questions and help resolve problems our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily 

our corporate marketing function is organized by customer type and is responsible for developing and executing marketing strategies new product launches and promotional and advertising support 

information systems 

information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics and management of medical data the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it systems it systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of root causes including telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are potentially exposed to physical or electronic breakin attempts computer viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures that we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems sustained or repeated system failures that would interrupt our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

historically acquired companies were often operated as local decentralized units and we did not standardize their billing laboratory or their other core information systems this resulted in many different information systems for billing test results reporting and other transactions 

we are in the process of implementing a standard laboratory information system and a standard billing system across all of our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions which we expect will take several more years to complete it will result in significantly more centralized systems than we have even today and better control over the operational environment we expect the integration of these systems will improve operating efficiency and provide management with more timely and comprehensive information with which to make management decisions however failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this magnitude workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed very carefully 

billing 

billing for laboratory services is complicated depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all of which have different billing requirements additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process other factors that complicate billing include 

differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates of the payers disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers missing incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians billings to payers with whom we do not have contracts and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for payment we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs because billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to numerous federal and state regulations and other billing requirements these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other factors medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity and costs to our operations changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process 

we believe that most of our bad debt expense which was 39 of our net revenues in 2006 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or missing we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense see “regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” the increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information see “recent changes in payer relationships” for a discussion of our billing to unh and its members 

competition 

while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we are the leading clinical laboratory testing provider in the united states with net revenues of 63 billion during 2006 and facilities in substantially all of the country’s major metropolitan areas our largest competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized esoteric labs as well as laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals see “payers and customers” 

we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a laboratory including 

service capability and quality accuracy timeliness and consistency in reporting test results number and type of tests performed by the laboratory number convenience and geographic coverage of patient service centers reputation in the medical community and pricing we believe that we are an effective competitor in each of these areas 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers and members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing industry will continue however a majority of the clinical laboratory testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us see “payers and customers– hospitals” as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 near patient tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our net revenues see “regulation of clinical laboratory operations” however as a result of our acquisition of hemocue focus diagnostics and enterix we believe that we are well positioned to service this market for physicians and hospitals we also believe that our overall near patient strategy will strengthen our relationship with our customers by enabling us to offer more solutions that improve their effectiveness and the care of their patients by enabling faster diagnosis and treatment see “recent acquisitions” 

quality assurance 

our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry our nichols institute facility in san juan capistrano was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve iso certification two of our clinical trials laboratories and two of our esoteric laboratories are also iso certified these certifications are international standards for quality management systems 

internal proficiency testing quality control and audits quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program 

external proficiency testing and accreditation all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american pathologists or cap as well as some state agencies 

cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of board certified pathologists cap is approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 “clia” cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional and esoteric laboratories and most of our rapid response laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program “cap whistle blower” hotline posters which are used to escalate unresolved quality and laboratory safety concerns to cap are posted in all of our cap accredited laboratories 

regulation of clinical laboratory operations 

the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and state regulation including inspections and audits by governmental agencies governmental authorities may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other actions to enforce laws and regulations including revoking a clinical laboratory’s federal certification which is required to operate a clinical laboratory operation changes in regulations may i increase our operating costs including but not limited to those costs associated with performing clinical laboratory tests and administrative requirements related to billing or ii decrease the amount of reimbursement related to testing services performed 

clia and state regulation all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely in may 2000 the cdc published a notice of intent to create a genetic specialty under clia however in september 2006 cms publicly announced that it did not intend to promulgate a rule creating a genetic specialty clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law for example state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

drug testing the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa regulates drug testing for public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses samhsa has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to perform drug testing on these employees all laboratories that perform such testing must be certified as meeting samhsa standards all of our laboratories that perform such testing are certified as meeting samhsa standards 

controlled substances the federal drug enforcement administration or dea regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse testing to obtain access to controlled substances laboratories must be licensed by the dea all of our laboratories that use controlled substances are licensed by the dea 

medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical laboratories are subject to federal state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of such waste and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories in the past the fda also has claimed regulatory authority over laboratorydeveloped tests but it has stated that it is exercising enforcement discretion in not regulating most laboratorydeveloped tests performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories on september 7 2006 the fda published two draft guidance documents that could impact us if finalized the first draft guidance document describes various manufacturer practices and products that the fda believes would take certain reagent products out of the class i exempt analyte specific reagent asr category the asr draft guidance if adopted as proposed could restrict laboratory access to certain products now available if in response to its adoption manufacturers voluntarily withdraw their products from the market the other draft guidance document describes certain laboratorydeveloped tests that the fda intends to regulate as in vitro diagnostic test systems ie as medical devices the fda calls this category of laboratorydeveloped tests “in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays” ivdmias the ivdmia draft guidance if adopted as published would extend fda oversight over laboratories that offer certain laboratorydeveloped tests many of the esoteric tests that we develop internally are first offered as laboratorydeveloped tests fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing would lead to increased regulatory burden and additional costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests representatives of clinical laboratories including us and the american clinical laboratory association our industry trade association or acla have communicated industry concerns to representatives of the fda about potential fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped testing and issues with regard to the continued availability of certain analyte specific reagents fda has extended to march 5 2007 its original deadline for public response to the draft guidance documents 

the diagnostic products business conducted by our in vitro diagnostic product manufacturing subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the fda as well as by foreign governmental agencies including countries within the european union who have adopted the directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices “ivdd” these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of diagnostics products prior to marketing or selling most diagnostic products we must secure approval from the fda and when appropriate counterpart nonus regulatory agencies although the ivdd allows us to market in europe many products using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the regulatory and quality requirements for the device following the introduction of a diagnostic product into the market the fda and nonus agencies engage in periodic reviews of the manufacturing processes and product performance compliance with these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us such as product suspensions recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions where appropriate voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls may be undertaken 

occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health administration or osha has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers this includes requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick injuries 

specimen transportation transportation of most clinical laboratory specimens and some laboratory supplies are considered hazardous materials subject to regulation by the department of transportation the public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association 

corporate practice of medicine many states including some in which our principal laboratories are located prohibit corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine the corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been interpreted in certain states to prohibit corporations from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of a corporation the scope of the doctrine and how it applies varies from state to state in certain states these restrictions affect our ability to directly provide anatomic pathology services andor to provide clinical laboratory services directly to consumers 

healthcare information technology 

clinical laboratories use information technology to obtain laboratory orders and to communicate results and provide other laboratory reporting innovations in healthcare information technology or hcit have the potential to improve patient 

care promote efficiency and reduce expense both at the federal and state levels there are public and private efforts to bring together healthcare providers information technology vendors and other stakeholders to facilitate the creation of healthcare information interoperability standards and a national healthcare network including adopting standard clinical code sets and standards for healthcare information electronic interoperability standards for the exchange and use of electronic healthcare data 

we and medplus our hcit subsidiary could be impacted by any national healthcare information network and the adoption of standards and codes for hcit interoperability because of substantial existing investments in software and hardware and the potential for having to make substantial future investments to comply with new or different standards and clinical coding systems on august 8 2006 the office of the inspector general or oig published a final rule providing safe harbors to the federal antikickback statute and cms published a final rule providing exceptions to the stark selfreferral prohibition law permitting various entities to provide eprescribing items and services and electronic health records ehr items and services under the final rules certain donors but not laboratories may provide eprescribing items and services to referral sources at no charge and a broader range of donors including laboratories may provide a broader range of hcit items and services in return for a payment of fifteen percent 15 of the donor’s cost and compliance with other conditions 

we and acla our trade association continue to monitor standards development proposed legislation and the rulemaking process through representatives on various industry work groups and governmental advisory bodies we are providing relevant information to policy makers to ensure that issues important to medical laboratories are reflected in any interoperability standards hcit legislation and proposed regulations 

privacy and security of health information standard transactions 

pursuant to hipaa the secretary of the department of health and human services “hhs” has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged three principal regulations have been issued in final form privacy regulations security regulations and standards for electronic transactions 

the hipaa privacy regulations which fully came into effect in april 2003 establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including 

the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient including but not limited to treatment purposes activities to obtain payment for our services and our healthcare operations activities a patient’s rights to access amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and administrative technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information we have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy regulations the hipaa privacy regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws in addition for healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries we need to comply with the laws of other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the final privacy regulations the privacy regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information 

the final hipaa security regulations which establish requirements for safeguarding electronic patient information were published on february 20 2003 and became effective on april 21 2003 although healthcare providers had until april 

20 2005 to comply we have implemented policies and standards to reasonably and appropriately comply with the requirements of the regulations 

the final hipaa regulations for electronic transactions which we refer to as the transaction standards establish uniform standards for electronic transactions and code sets including the electronic transactions and code sets used for billing claims remittance advices enrollment and eligibility we have completed conversion to the required standard format for our electronic feeforservice claim transactions and our electronic feeforservice remittance transactions 

in addition to having completed conversion to the required standard format for our electronic claim and remittance transactions we are actively in the process of completing systems planning for compliance with hipaa regulations on adoption of national provider identifiers “npi” the npi regulations require health care providers to adopt new unique identifiers for reporting on claims transactions after may 23 2007 the new identifiers will replace existing identifiers such as provider numbers historically assigned by medicare to laboratories and unique physician identification numbers “upin” assigned by cms to medicare participating physicians on claims that require provider identifiers we have obtained npis for all of our laboratory facilities and we have updated our billing systems so that we can report our npis to medicare medicaid and other commercial health plans we have also updated our billing systems so that we can report the npis of referring physicians for our claims that require referring physician npi information after may 23 2007 such as claims submitted to the medicare program we are in the process of obtaining npi information from our physician clients and expect that the process will continue up to and beyond may 23 2007 as of february 23 2007 cms reports that approximately 60 of physicians have obtained npis there is industry concern with the number of physicians and other health providers who have not yet obtained npis and various groups have requested that cms consider adopting a contingency period of one year or more for compliance with npi regulations while cms has adopted similar contingency periods for electronic claim and remittance transactions in the past there is no indication yet that they will do the same for npi we will continue efforts to obtain available referring physician npis and expect that most of the available npis will be obtained prior to may 23 2007 

regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services 

overview the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years government payers such as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and medicaid which principally serves indigent patients as well as private payers and large employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical laboratory services if we cannot offset future reductions in the payments we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor introducing new procedures it could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability 

while the total cost to comply with medicare administrative claims requirements is disproportionate to our cost to bill other payers average medicare reimbursement rates are not materially different than our overall average reimbursement rate from all payers making this business generally less profitable despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare and medicaid programs we continue to participate in such programs because we believe that our other business may depend in part on continued participation in these programs since certain customers may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services regardless of who pays for such services 

billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per violation plus up to three times the amount claimed 

reduced reimbursements in 1984 congress established a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program congress then imposed a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare fee schedules since then congress has periodically reduced the national ceilings the medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced in 1996 to 76 of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in 1998 to 74 of the 1984 national median the national ceiling applies to tests for which limitation amounts were established before january 1 2001 for more recent tests tests for which a limitation amount is first established on or after january 1 2001 the limitation amount is set at 100 of the median of all the local fee schedules established for that test in accordance with the social security act the mma eliminated for five years beginning january 1 2004 the provision for annual increases to the medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer price index thus by law an adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical laboratory services based on the consumer price index 

cannot occur before january 1 2009 however the mma added coverage for certain cardiovascular screening tests and diabetes screening tests subject to certain frequency limitations the mma evaluates new diagnostic tests for coverage as they are introduced 

with regard to the clinical laboratory services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare major clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics typically use two fee schedules for tests billed on a feeforservice basis 

“client” fees charged to physicians hospitals and institutions for which a clinical laboratory performs testing services on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis these fees are generally subject to negotiation or discount “patient” fees charged to individual patients and thirdparty payers like medicare and medicaid these fees generally require separate bills for each requisition the fee schedule amounts established by medicare are typically substantially lower than patient fees otherwise charged by us but are sometimes higher than our fees actually charged to certain clients during 1992 the oig of the hhs issued final regulations that prohibited charging medicare fees substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges the laboratory industry believes that the term “usual charges” specifically applies to amounts charged to similarlysituated thirdparty payers and to patients and that client fees should not be included in “usual charges” the oig however declined to provide any guidance concerning interpretation of these rules including whether or not discounts to nongovernmental clients and payers or the dualfee structure might be inconsistent with these rules 

a proposed rule released in september 1997 would have authorized the oig to exclude providers including clinical laboratories from participation in the medicare program that charge medicare and other programs fees that are “substantially in excess of    usual charges    to any of their customers clients or patients” this proposal was withdrawn by the oig in 1998 in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion which indicated that a clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the “usual charges” regulation if the “charge to medicare substantially exceeds the amount the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept from nonfederal payers” the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to private pay customers 

in september 2003 the oig published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the oig’s exclusion regulations addressing excessive claims under the proposed exclusion rule the oig would have the authority to exclude a provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are substantially in excess of the provider’s usual charges the proposal would define “usual charges” as the average payment from nongovernment entities on a test by test basis excluding capitated payments and would define “substantially in excess” to be an amount that is more than 20 greater than the usual charge we believe that the proposed rule is unnecessary for the clinical laboratory industry because congress has already established fee schedules for the services that the rule proposes to regulate we also believe that the proposed rule is unworkable and overly burdensome through our industry trade association we filed comments opposing the proposed rule and we are working with our trade association and a coalition of other healthcare providers who also oppose this proposed regulation as drafted if this regulation is adopted as proposed it could potentially reduce the amounts we bill and collect from medicare and other federal payers affect the fees we charge to other payers or subject the company to penalties for noncompliance and could also be costly for us to administer 

the 1997 balanced budget act permits cms to adjust statutorily prescribed fees for some medical services including clinical laboratory services if the fees are “grossly excessive” in december 2002 cms issued an interim final rule setting forth a process and factors for establishing a “realistic and equitable” payment amount for all medicare part b services except physician services and services paid under a prospective payment system when the existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be considered unreasonable because they are either grossly excessive or deficient in december 2005 cms published the final rule clarifying that if cms or a carrier determines that an overall payment adjustment of less than 15 is needed to produce a realistic and equitable payment amount then the payment amount is not considered “grossly excessive or deficient” however if a determination is made that a payment adjustment of 15 or more is justified cms could provide an adjustment of less than 15 but not more than 15 in any given year we cannot 

provide any assurances to investors that fees payable by medicare could not be reduced as a result of the application of this rule or that the government might not assert claims for reimbursement by purporting to retroactively apply this rule or the oig interpretation concerning “usual charges” 

currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing when copayments were last in effect before adoption of the clinical laboratory services fee schedules in 1984 clinical laboratories received from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed amount and were required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid balance of the medicare allowed amount if reenacted a copayment requirement could adversely affect the revenues of the clinical laboratory industry including us by exposing the testing laboratory to the credit of individuals and by increasing the number of bills in addition a laboratory could be subject to potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate procedures to bill and collect the copayments are not established and followed the medicare reform bill approved by the united states senate in june 2003 included a copayment provision under which clinical laboratories would receive from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule amount for clinical laboratory tests and would be required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the 20 balance the copayment provision was dropped from the bill as passed known as the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” we cannot provide any assurances to investors that congress would not seek to reimpose a copayment requirement payable by medicare beneficiaries for clinical laboratory services certain medicaid programs already require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing 

reduced utilization of clinical laboratory testing in recent years cms has taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory testing paid by medicare and medicaid since 1995 medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients however cms has not prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide this diagnostic information to laboratories moreover regulations adopted in accordance with hipaa require submission of diagnosis codes as part of the standard claims transaction 

we are generally permitted to bill medicare beneficiaries directly for statutorily excluded clinical laboratory services if a medicare beneficiary signs an advance beneficiary notice or abn we are also generally permitted to bill the beneficiary for clinical laboratory tests that medicare does not cover due to “medical necessity” limitations these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by medicare an abn is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patient’s informed decision to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which are likely to be denied and not reimbursed by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically necessary we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the physician’s office staff if the abn is not timely provided to the beneficiary or is not completed properly we may end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient if they are not reimbursable by medicare due to coverage limitations 

inconsistent practices currently many different local carriers administer medicare they have inconsistent policies on matters such as 1 test coverage 2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims documentation and 5 fee schedules subject to the national fee schedule limitations inconsistent carrier rules and policies have increased the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories as part of the 1997 balanced budget act hhs was required to adopt uniform policies on the above matters by january 1 1999 and to replace the current local carriers with no more than five regional carriers additionally the mma required that cms consolidate the administration of part a and part b benefits under the same contractor titled the medicare administrative contractor mac currently different contractors administer part a and part b benefits for the same geographic area on july 31 2006 cms announced that they had awarded the first of 15 mac contracts to noridian administrative services noridian will serve as the first contractor to process and pay both part a and part b claims for medicare beneficiaries in arizona montana north dakota south dakota utah and wyoming the remaining contracts will be awarded by 2011 in order to meet the requirements of the mma 

carrier jurisdiction changes for labtolab referrals on october 31 2003 cms announced its intention to change the manner in which medicare contractors currently process claims for labtolab referrals of clinical laboratory tests while laboratories are under certain criteria permitted to directly bill medicare for clinical laboratory tests they refer to other laboratories they must be reimbursed at the correct fee schedule amount based on the medicare fee schedule in effect in the medicare carrier region in which the test was actually performed historically laboratories needed to enroll with and file claims to multiple carriers in order to bill for such outofarea test referrals to ensure receipt of the appropriate payment amount this has proven to be an administratively difficult process with many obstacles to obtaining accurate claims payment including applying the correct fee schedule on july 1 2004 cms implemented a change mandating that the laboratory’s “home” carrier maintain and apply the clinical laboratory fee schedule applicable to the carrier region where the referred test was performed this streamlined process allows a laboratory to file all of its clinical laboratory claims to its “home” carrier 

cms also has announced a parallel change with regard to purchased diagnostic interpretations pathology services a previously announced change in medicare carrier jurisdiction rules required laboratories to bill the carrier where a purchased diagnostic interpretation service was performed this would have required multiple carriers to issue medicare provider numbers to a laboratory billing for purchased diagnostic interpretation services performed by others in october 2004 cms posted a “change notice” permitting laboratories to temporarily bill their local carriers for purchased diagnostic tests or interpretations regardless of the location where the interpretive service was furnished the final change notice was issued on october 29 2004 effective april 1 2005 the final notice requires carriers to implement a new edit to check for duplicate claims for referred clinical diagnostic laboratory and purchased diagnostic services submitted by physicianssuppliers to more than one carrier 

competitive bidding  the mma requires cms to conduct two demonstration projects of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory tests cms awarded the clinical laboratory competitive bidding demonstration design and implementation contract to rti international research triangle park north carolina and its subcontractor palmetto gba palmetto is a part b carrier and previously conducted for cms a competitive bidding demonstration for durable medical equipment dme in august 2005 rti presented its draft design at a public meeting the rti proposal incorporated several acla recommendations including having bidders bid on the full range of tests paid under the laboratory fee schedule utilizing a feeforservice basis for bidding and allowing bidders to subcontract cms was required to submit its initial report on the competitive bidding proposal by december 31 2005 in april 2006 cms issued a brief status report endorsing the rti draft design cms is holding to its plans to announce the competitive bidding demonstration areas and begin accepting bids from clinical laboratories by the second quarter of 2007 however the office of management and budget omb which has approved the bidding form has not yet approved cms’s design for the competitive bidding program or the two sites for the pilots since a number of necessary steps must occur after omb approval at this time it is uncertain when an actual demonstration could begin in addition because the laboratory industry is concerned about the general lack of responsiveness by cms to industry concerns about the bidding process it is discussing industry concerns with members of congress and committee staffs in addition the president’s 2008 budget proposes medicare cost savings from competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services of 238 billion over five years including 110 million in 2008 this estimate appears to presume that cms would implement competitive bidding before completion of the medicare competitive bidding demonstration we believe that clinical laboratory services are not commodities like dme and the quality of services and access to those services could be adversely impacted by implementation of competitive bidding if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical laboratory testing it could materially adversely affect the clinical laboratory industry and us 

future legislation future changes in federal state and local regulations or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely affect us we cannot predict however whether and what type of legislative proposals will be enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by regulatory authorities 

fraud and abuse regulations medicare and medicaid antikickback laws prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or other federal programs as noted above the penalties for violation of these laws may include criminal and civil fines and penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in federal programs many of the antifraud statutes and regulations including those relating to joint ventures and alliances are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot predict if some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted contrary to our practices 

in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion concluding that the industry practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if the discounted price is below a laboratory’s overall cost including overhead and below the amounts reimbursed by medicare advisory opinions are not binding but may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement actions the oig’s opinion if enforced could result in fines and possible exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below the rates reimbursed by medicare the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se violation of the federal antikickback statute but may merit further investigation depending on the facts and circumstances presented 

in addition since 1992 a federal anti“selfreferral” law commonly known as the “stark” law prohibits with certain exceptions medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally or through a family member have an investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory since january 1995 these restrictions have also applied to medicaidcovered services many states have similar anti”selfreferral” and other laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians we cannot predict if some of the state laws will be interpreted contrary to our practices 

in april 2003 the oig issued a special advisory bulletin addressing what it described as “questionable contractual arrangements” in contractual joint ventures the oig bulletin focused on arrangements where a healthcare provider or owner expands into a related healthcare business by contracting with a healthcare provider or manager that already is engaged in that 

line of business for the manager to provide related healthcare items or services to the patients of the owner in return for a share of the profits of the new line of business while we believe that the bulletin is directed at “sham” arrangements intended to induce referrals we cannot predict whether the oig might choose to investigate all contractual joint ventures including our joint ventures with various hospitals or hospital systems 

in august 2006 the oig published a final rule providing safe harbors to the federal antikickback statute and cms published a final rule providing exceptions to the stark selfreferral prohibition law with respect to eprescribing items and services and electronic health records ehr items and services see “healthcare information technology” 

government investigations and related claims 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with government settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur additional liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business certain federal and state statues regulations and other laws including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claim act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers private payers andor patients alleging inappropriate billing practices 

during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled significant government claims that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both companies believed to be lawful the federal or state governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 17 of our net revenues during 2006 

we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential liability we are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act and other federal and state statutes regulations andor other laws these lawsuits include class action and individual claims by patients arising out of the company’s billing policies and practices in addition we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company and nid each received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the subpoenas request a wide range of business records including documents regarding testing and test kits related to parathyroid hormone “pth” testing the company is cooperating with the united states attorney’s office the company has voluntarily provided information witnesses and business records of nid and the company including documents related to testing and various test kits other than pth tests which were not requested in the initial subpoenas during the third quarter of 2006 the government issued two additional subpoenas one to nid and one to the company the subpoenas cover various records including records related to test kits in addition to pth the government may issue additional subpoenas in the course of its investigation this investigation could lead to civil and criminal damages fines and penalties and additional liabilities from third party claims in the second and third quarters of 2005 the fda conducted an inspection of nid and issued a form 483 listing the observations made by the fda during the course of the inspection nid responded to the form 483 noncompliance with the fda regulatory requirements or failure to take adequate and timely corrective action could lead to regulatory or enforcement action against nid andor the company including but not limited to a warning letter injunction fines or penalties recommendation against award of governmental contracts and criminal prosecution on april 19 2006 the company decided to discontinue the operations of nid see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

during the second quarter of 2005 the company received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey the subpoena seeks the production of business and financial records regarding capitation and risk 

sharing arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993 through 1999 also during the third quarter of 2005 the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of the inspector general the subpoena seeks the production of various business records including records regarding our relationship with health maintenance organizations independent physician associations group purchasing organizations and preferred provider organizations from 1995 to the present the company is cooperating with the united states attorney’s office and the office of the inspector general 

during the second quarter of 2006 the company received a subpoena from the california attorney general’s office the subpoena seeks various documents including documents relating to billings to medical the california medicaid program the subpoena seeks documents from various time frames ranging from three to ten years the company is cooperating with the california attorney general’s office 

several of the proceedings discussed above are in their early stages of development and involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas while the company believes that at least a reasonable possibility exists that losses may have been incurred based on the nature and status of the investigations the losses are either currently not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 

although management cannot predict the outcome of such matters management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

as an integral part of our compliance program discussed below we investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient 

compliance program 

compliance with all government rules and regulations is a significant concern throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of evolving interpretations of regulations and the emerging changes in laboratory science and healthcare technology we established a compliance program early in 1993 

we emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures personnel and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations the quality safety  compliance committee of the board of directors requires periodic reporting of compliance operations from management 

we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot assure investors that applicable statutes or regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect us potential sanctions for violation of these statutes include significant damages penalties and fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorization necessary to operate some or all of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

intellectual property rights 

our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

cease developing performing or selling products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right redesign or reengineer our tests 23 

change our business processes or pay substantial damages court costs and attorneys’ fees including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful patents generally are not issued until several years after an application is filed the possibility that before a patent is issued to a third party we may be performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense to an infringement claim thus even tests that we develop could become the subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those tests 

infringement and other intellectual property claims regardless of their merit can be expensive and timeconsuming to litigate in addition any requirement to reengineer our tests or change our business processes could substantially increase our costs force us to interrupt product sales or delay new test releases in the past we have settled several disputes regarding our alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties we are currently involved in settling several additional disputes we do not believe that resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however infringement claims could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing 

insurance 

as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims some of these suits involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the basis for claims reserves considers actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience management believes that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures although management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the company management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or paid similarly although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 41000 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 




 item 1a risk factors 

efforts by third party payers including the government to reduce utilization and pricing could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid as well as private payers and larger employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical laboratory services by law an adjustment to the medicare national fee schedule for clinical laboratory services based on the consumer price index cannot occur before january 1 2009 congressional budget reconciliation efforts could result in further reductions in medicare andor medicaid expenditures for laboratory services in the future in addition by law cms is required to conduct two demonstration projects of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical laboratory testing it could materially adversely affect the clinical laboratory testing industry and us in september 2003 the oig published a proposed regulation that would authorize the oig to exclude a provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are substantially in excess of the provider’s usual charges if this regulation is adopted as proposed it could potentially reduce the amounts we bill and collect from medicare and other federal payers affect the fees we charge to other payers or subject us to penalties for noncompliance and could also be costly for us to administer for a more detailed description of the developments in government regulations see “business  regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power in negotiating fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these healthcare insurers as well as independent physician associations demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements historically healthcare insurers which had limited their network of laboratory service providers encouraged their members and sometimes offered incentives to utilize only contracted providers in cases where members choose to use a noncontracted provider due to service quality or convenience the noncontracted provider would be reimbursed at rates considered “reasonable and customary” in addition patients who use a noncontracted provider may have a higher coinsurance responsibility which may result in physicians referring testing to contracted providers to minimize the expense to their patients contracted rates are generally lower than “reasonable and customary” rates because of the potential for greater volume as a contracted provider however a noncontracted laboratory service provider with quality and service preferred by physicians and patients to that of contracted providers could potentially realize greater profits than if it was a contracted provider provided that physicians and patients continue to have choice in selecting their provider physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical laboratory testing volume and often refer work to us as a noncontracted provider recent experience indicates that at least one large healthcare insurer unh is looking to restrict or eliminate the choice of physicians and in turn their patients by threatening to impose financial penalties on physicians for referring patients to noncontracted laboratory service providers if this approach is successful in influencing physicians to no longer use noncontracted laboratories it could make it substantially more difficult for a laboratory service provider to sufficiently differentiate itself based on quality and service in order to profitably operate as a noncontracted provider could lead to other healthcare insurers using similar tactics and could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows see “business—recent changes in payer relationships” and “business—payers and customers—healthcare insurers” 

we expect efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue these efforts as well as changes in payer mix including an increase in the percentage of patients covered by capitated payment arrangements could negatively impact our net revenues if we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor introducing new procedures our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with extensive laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with government settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from third party claims all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled significant government claims that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both companies believed to be lawful the federal or state governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 17 of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 

we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential liability we are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act and other federal and state statutes these lawsuits include class action and individual claims by patients arising out of the company’s billing practices in addition we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount 

a pending investigation by the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york regarding the operations of nid could lead to civil and criminal damages fines and penalties and additional liabilities from third party claims against us we have also received other subpoenas seeking production of business and financial records regarding arrangements with government and private payers for additional details regarding these matters please see “business—government investigations and related claims” 

several of these proceedings discussed above are in their early stages of development and involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas while the company believes that at least a reasonable possibility exists that losses may have been incurred based on the nature and status of the investigations the losses are either currently not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 

although management cannot predict the outcome of such matters management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

as an integral part of our compliance program we investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and bad debt expense 

billing for laboratory services is extremely complicated see “business billing” depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians hospitals and employer groups all of which have different billing requirements additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process see “business regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients or increase our costs cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process 

we believe that much of our bad debt expense which was 39 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs could lead to various penalties including 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and 

authorizations necessary to operate our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

in addition to the investigations described in “business – government investigations and related claims” we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including among other things disputes as to intellectual property professional liability and employeerelated matters as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers regarding billing issues see “business regulation of clinical laboratory operations” and “intellectual property rights” some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have insurance or are substantially selfinsured for a significant portion of any liability with respect to such claims see “business insurance” although we cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings or any claims made against us we do not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of the various proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or failures to adapt existing systems to proposed health information technology hit standards could significantly increase turnaround time otherwise disrupt our operations or lead to increased competition by other providers of laboratory services all of which could reduce our customer base and result in lost net revenues 

information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it systems it systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

we are in the process of implementing a standard laboratory information system and a standard billing system which we expect will take several years to complete see “business–information systems” failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

in addition public and private initiatives to create hit standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information including laboratory results could require costly modifications to our existing it systems see “business—healthcare information technology” while we do not expect hit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply failure or delay in implementing hit or clinical coding standards interoperability standards or in adopting and incorporating standardized clinical coding systems in our it systems could result in a loss of customers a loss of business opportunities and could adversely affect our reputation 

integrating our operations with business we acquire may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are in the process of integrating into our company the operations of several companies that we have acquired during the past eighteen months including labone and focus diagnostics see “business—recent acquisitions” we expect to continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of domestic clinical laboratories that can be integrated into our existing laboratories we are actively exploring opportunities in the area of near patient testing and intend to capitalize on this trend to augment our laboratory testing business additionally we see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic testing to international markets particularly developing countries where the testing markets are highly fragmented and less mature each acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that previously operated independently and has different systems processes and cultures the process of combining such companies may be disruptive to both of our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

loss of key customers or employees failure to maintain the quality of services that our company has historically provided diversion of management’s attention from the daytoday business of our company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties and the added costs of dealing with such disruptions in addition because most of our clinical laboratory testing is performed under arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice any such interruption of or deterioration in our services may result in a customer’s decision to stop using us for clinical laboratory testing 

even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of focus diagnostics or the operations of other companies or business we may acquire in the future we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration either in monetary terms or a timely manner 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 156 billion of debt outstanding with 500 million of available capacity under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility except for outstanding letters of credit and operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details related to our outstanding debt set forth in the table below for each of the next five years is the aggregate amount of scheduled principal estimated interest and total payments with respect to our debt outstanding as of december 31 2006 including capital leases assuming that maturing debt is refinanced for purposes of estimating interest 

 on january 31 2007 in connection with the acquisition of hemocue we borrowed 450 million under a oneyear term loan see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

our debt portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2006 we had 375 million of floating rate debt based on our net exposure to interest rate changes an assumed 10 change in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness representing approximately 54 basis points would impact annual net interest expense by approximately 2 million assuming no changes to the debt outstanding at december 31 2006 in addition any future borrowings by us under the unsecured revolving credit facility the secured receivables credit facility or the issuance of other floating rate debt will expose us to additional interest rate risk interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility term loan and secured receivables credit facility are also subject to a pricing schedule that fluctuates based on changes in our credit rating 

our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt 

we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s and moody’s investors service there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan would increase changes in our credit ratings do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if we incur additional debt a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in this case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

failure to provide a higher quality of service than that of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical laboratory testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry 

we primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers—hospitalaffiliated laboratories other independent clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing on their patients in addition many hospitals compete with independent clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and many hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality of service our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs 

the hipaa privacy and security regulations which became fully effective in april 2003 and april 2005 respectively establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of protected health information see “business privacy and security of health information standard transactions” 

we have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy and security regulations as required by law the privacy regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state privacy laws in addition for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries we must comply with the laws of those other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information 

we are actively in the process of completing systems planning for compliance with hipaa regulations on adoption of npi which becomes effective on may 23 2007 see “business privacy and security of health information standard transactions” we have obtained npis for all of our laboratory facilities and we have updated our billing systems so that we can report our npis to medicare medicaid and other commercial health plans we are in the process of obtaining npi information from our physician clients and expect that the process will continue up to and beyond may 23 2007 as of february 27 2007 cms reports that approximately 60 of physicians have obtained npis there is industry concern with the number of physicians and other health providers who have not yet obtained npis and various groups have requested that cms consider adopting a contingency period of one year or more for compliance with npi regulations while cms has adopted similar contingency periods for electronic claim and remittance transactions in the past there is no indication yet that they will do the same for npi we will continue efforts to obtain available referring physician npis and expect that most of the available npis will be obtained prior to may 23 2007 we could face a disruption in reimbursement with respect to tests referred by clients that do not timely receive npis 

compliance with all of the hipaa regulations including the regulations for electronic transactions and npis requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations not just quest diagnostics while we believe our total costs to comply with hipaa will not be material to our operations or cash flows new standard transactions and additional customer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us 

fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests analyte specific reagents or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories in the past the fda also claimed regulatory authority over laboratorydeveloped tests but has stated that it is exercising enforcement discretion in not regulating most laboratory developed tests performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories on september 7 2006 the fda published two draft guidance documents the first draft guidance document describes various manufacturer practices and products that the fda believes would take certain reagent products out of the class i exempt analyte specific reagent asr category the asr draft guidance if adopted as proposed could restrict laboratory access to certain products now available if in response to its adoption manufacturers voluntarily withdraw their products from the market the other draft guidance document describes certain laboratorydeveloped tests that the fda intends to regulate as in vitro diagnostic test systems ie as medical devices the fda calls this category of laboratorydeveloped tests “in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays” ivdmias the ivdmia draft guidance if adopted as published would extend fda oversight over laboratories that offer certain laboratorydeveloped tests many of the esoteric tests that we develop internally are first offered as laboratorydeveloped tests fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing would lead to increased regulatory burden and additional costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests fda has extended to march 5 2007 its original deadline for public response to the draft guidance documents 

failure to develop or acquire licenses for new or improved testing technologies or the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests technology and services will depend in part on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms we may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests if we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates our research and development costs may increase as a result in addition if we are unable to license new or improved technologies to expand our esoteric testing business our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected see “business intellectual property rights” 

advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of an independent clinical laboratory such as 1 near patient tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our net revenues clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point of care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and the secretary of hhs has delegated to the fda the authority to determine whether particular tests waived tests are “simple” and have “an insignificant risk of an erroneous result” under clia however we believe our acquisitions of hemocue focus diagnostics and enterix will help position us to service this market for physicians and hospitals see “business—recent acquisitions” 

our growing international operations expose us to certain risks inherent in conducting business in international markets 

our acquisition of hemocue in january 2007 has increased our international operations and consequently our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets depending on the market these risks include but are not limited to changes in the local economic environment political instability social changes exchange controls weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights developments in foreign regulation as well as potentially longer payment and collection cycles we will increasingly provide services in one country from a base in another and move 

products from one country to another as a result we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in importexport controls and customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results in addition the revenue we earn and the expenses we incur in our international operations are primarily denominated in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar and as a result we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations we may incur substantial expense as a result of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic or regulatory environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism or other hostilities or other future financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations international operations also require us to devote significant management resources implement our controls and systems in new markets and overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful nevertheless we expect to expand further our international operations through acquisition or otherwise which would increase these risks 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens or to receive materials from our suppliers 

our organizational documents and other agreements contain restrictions that might prevent a takeover or change in management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws might have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting a takeover on terms that some shareholders might favor reducing the opportunity for shareholders to sell shares at a premium over thenprevailing market prices and prevent or frustrate attempts to replace or remove current management these provisions include 

a requirement that the board of directors be classified the authorization of a “blank check” preferred stock to be issued at the discretion of the board of directors and a requirement that we receive advance notice of shareholder nominees for director and shareholder proposals 31

the united states clinical laboratory testing market 

clinical laboratory testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized as clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing clinical testing is performed on body fluids such as blood and urine anatomic pathology testing is performed on tissues including biopsies and other samples such as human cells many clinical laboratory tests are considered routine and can be performed by most commercial clinical laboratories tests that are not routine and that require more sophisticated equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric tests esoteric tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that specialize in performing those tests 

we believe that the united states clinical laboratory testing market exceeded 40 billion in annual revenues in 2005 most laboratory tests are performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories in 2005 we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories accounted for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance 

the underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry have improved since the early to mid1990s since that time there has been significant industry consolidation particularly among commercial laboratories resulting in fewer but larger commercial laboratories with greater economies of scale better equipped to service the members of large healthcare plans and more disciplined in their approach to operating their business orders for laboratory testing are generated from physician offices hospitals and employers as such factors including changes in the united states economy which can affect 

the number of unemployed and uninsured and design changes in healthcare plans which impact the number of physician office and hospital visits can impact the utilization of laboratory testing 

while the diagnostic testing industry in the united states may be impacted by a number of factors we believe it will continue to grow over the long term as a result of the following 

 corporate strategy and growth opportunities 

our mission is to be the undisputed world leader in diagnostic testing information and services we focus on patients growth and people to help achieve our goals 

patients are at the center of everything we do increasingly patients and their doctors have a choice when it comes to selecting a healthcare provider and we strive to give them new and compelling reasons to put their trust in us we differentiate our company to patients and doctors by 

 growth is driven organically and through acquisition we expect to grow organically at or above the industry growth rate by gaining more customers and selling more to existing customers historically our industry has focused primarily on service levels and aggressive pricing to drive organic volume growth we believe that the differentiation we are creating through our focus on six sigma quality unparalleled access and distribution the most comprehensive test menu and innovative test and information technology offerings will provide us with a competitive advantage and enable us to maintain pricing discipline as we drive profitable organic growth additionally we are investing in sales and marketing providing the sales force with better tools and training and adding innovative new products to sell we are specifically focused on driving profitable organic growth in highergrowth areas by being a leading innovator our principal areas of focus include 

 2 

  we expect to continue pursuing growth through acquisitions historically as the clinical laboratory industry consolidated acquisitions contributed a significant portion of our growth we believe that organic growth will become more significant while acquisitions will continue to be an important contributor to growth 

the clinical laboratory industry remains highly fragmented we expect to continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of regional clinical laboratories that can be integrated into our existing laboratories thereby increasing access for 

patients and enabling us to reduce costs and improve efficiencies see “recent acquisition” for a discussion of our recent acquisitions we will also selectively assess potential acquisition opportunities that will increase clinical capabilities geographic presence or move us into related adjacent spaces both domestically and internationally during 2005 through the acquisition of labone we entered into a new testingrelated field providing laboratory testing and risk assessment services to the life insurance industry 

rapid development of new tests and technologies continues in addition hospitals and physician office laboratories increasingly are internalizing testing moving testing closer to the patient as a result we will consider acquiring or exclusively licensing selective products to complement the services we provide 

technology is making possible the convergence of various healthcare disciplines information technology will eventually enable doctors to diagnose and treat disease by aggregating a patient’s genetic predisposition diagnostic test results and diagnostic images into a patientcentric electronic medical record available in a timely fashion at the point of care having such clinical data in one easily accessed place will enable better decisionmaking and drive improved outcomes for patients accordingly potential acquisitions in adjacent industries such as healthcare information technology and diagnostic imaging may also be considered our acquisition of medplus in 2001 was our first acquisition of a healthcare information technology company 

people enable us to realize our mission in this regard an important challenge is to prepare our workforce for the future our people strategy is built on concepts of stringent employee selection effective engagement and ongoing development resulting in a staff of highly qualified and motivated employees who are committed to our goals in addition we are committed to improving the health of our employees and reducing healthcare costs for them and our company through our healthyquest initiative we provide employees with the opportunity to lose weight quit smoking and generally pursue healthier lifestyles quest diagnostics is recognized as a “best place to work” in numerous locales as a consequence of our workplace initiatives that reflect our belief that people are our most important asset we take diversity seriously believing that our organization should reasonably reflect the communities that we serve we strive to make all of our employees effective ambassadors of our company 

recent acquisition 

on november 1 2005 we acquired lab one  inc or labone in a transaction valued at approximately 947 million including approximately 138 million of assumed debt of labone labone provides health screening and risk assessment services to life insurance companies as well as clinical diagnostic testing services to healthcare providers and drugsofabuse testing to employers labone operates major laboratories in lenexa kansas and cincinnati ohio as well as a stateoftheart call center in lee’s summit missouri and provides paramedical examination services throughout the united states and canada to serve the life insurance industry the acquisition of labone supports our growth strategy in a number of ways including solidifying our leadership position in diagnostic testing by expanding access for physicians and patients and giving us added presence in several geographic areas strengthening our drugsofabuse testing business and establishing us as the leader in a new testing net related business providing health screening and risk assessment services to the life insurance industry 

our services 

for 2005 our clinical laboratory testing business accounted for approximately 95 of our net revenues with the balance derived from clinical trials testing risk assessment services and other services and products laboratory testing includes routine testing and genebased and esoteric testing which generated approximately 78 and 17 respectively of our net revenues clinical trials testing generated less than 3 of our net revenues and risk assessment services generated less than 1 of our net revenues we derive approximately 2 of our net revenues from foreign operations we expect that the risk assessment business will represent approximately 4 of our net revenues in 2006 bringing the total net revenues attributable to our nonclinical testing businesses to approximately 8 of our consolidated net revenues 

routine testing 

routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly ordered tests include 

 4 

 we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories rapid response laboratories and patient service centers we also perform routine testing at the hospital laboratories we manage major laboratories offer a full line of routine clinical tests rapid response laboratories are smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times patient service centers are facilities where specimens are collected and are typically located in or near a building used by medical professionals 

we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most routine procedures within 24 hours the majority of test results are delivered electronically 

esoteric testing 

esoteric tests are those tests that require more sophisticated technology equipment or materials professional “handson” attention from highly skilled and technical personnel and that may be performed less frequently than routine tests because it is not costeffective for most hospital and clinical laboratories to perform lowvolume esoteric tests inhouse they generally refer many of these tests to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory that specializes in performing these more complex tests due to their complexity esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests 

our two esoteric testing laboratories which conduct business as quest diagnostics nichols institute are among the leading esoteric clinical testing laboratories in the world in 1998 our esoteric testing laboratory in san juan capistrano california was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve international organization for standardization or iso 9001 certification our esoteric testing laboratory in chantilly virginia enables us to provide full esoteric testing services on the east coast our two esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of esoteric tests that are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories these esoteric tests are generally in the following fields 

 5 

new test introductions 

we intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce new diagnostic tests as the industry leader with the largest and broadest laboratory network and the leading provider of esoteric testing we believe that we are the best partner for developers of new technology and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace 

we continued to be a leading innovator in the industry in 2005 through tests that we developed at quest diagnostics nichols institute the largest provider of molecular diagnostic testing in the united states as well as through relationships with technology developers we believe that we are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovations to the market through our relationships with the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms as well as collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies 

we primarily focus our resources on three disease states cardiovascular disease cancer and infectious disease as well as on continued advancements in molecular diagnostics during 2005 we introduced approximately 75 new and improved assays including 

 we proactively search for new opportunities in screening diagnosis prognosis treatment choice and treatment monitoring we believe that with the unveiling of the human genome and its extension into proteomics new genes and combinations of proteins will continue to be discovered at an accelerating pace and will result in ever more complex and thorough predictive and diagnostic testing we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these advances 

as testing methods become more complex we believe that it is also important to provide sound medical and scientific consultation to ensure the correct application and interpretation of the test results our medical and scientific directors are always available for consultation to our customers in 2005 we further enhanced our consultation programs supported with our enhanced reporting initiatives particularly in the complex areas of hematopathology and coagulation we believe consultation services will provide higher confidence in the adoption of the new tests we develop and lead to improved client satisfaction and improved patient outcomes 

risk assessment services 

we believe that we are the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in the united states our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services to the life insurance industry including teleunderwriting specimen collection and paramedical examinations laboratory testing medical record retrieval motor vehicle reports telephone inspections and credit checks the laboratory tests performed and data gathered by us are specifically designed to assist an insurance company in objectively evaluating the mortality and morbidity risks posed by policy applicants the majority of the testing is performed on specimens of individual life insurance policy applicants but also includes specimens of individuals applying for individual and group medical and disability policies we also provide risk assessment services in canada 

clinical trials testing 

we believe that we are the world’s second largest provider of clinical laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs clinical research trials are required by the food and drug administration or fda and 

other international regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs we have clinical trials testing centers in the united states and in the united kingdom we also provide clinical trials testing in australia singapore and south africa through arrangements with third parties clinical trials involving new drugs are increasingly being performed both inside and outside the united states approximately 50 of our net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2005 represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc or gsk we currently have a longterm contractual relationship with gsk under which we are the primary provider of testing to support gsk’s clinical trials testing requirements worldwide 

other services and products 

we manufacture and market diagnostic test kits and systems primarily for esoteric testing through our nichols institute diagnostics subsidiary these are sold principally to hospitals clinical laboratories and dialysis centers both domestically and internationally 

our medplus subsidiary is a developer and integrator of clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare organizations physicians and clinicians primarily through its chartmaxx â electronic medical record system for hospitals and our care360 suite of products the care360 physician portal was developed by medplus and enables physicians to order diagnostic tests and review laboratory results from quest diagnostics online in addition the care360 physician portal enables physicians to electronically prescribe medications view clinical and administrative information from multiple sources file certain documents into a patientcentric health record maintained in our repository and share confidential patient information with medical colleagues in a manner that is consistent with hipaa privacy and security requirements 

payers and customers 

we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers we consider a “payer” as the party that pays for the test and a “customer” as the party who refers the test to us depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 the physician or other party such as a hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 2 the patient or 3 a third party who pays the bill for the patient such as an insurance company medicare or medicaid some states including new york new jersey and rhode island prohibit us from billing physician clients during 2005 only three customers accounted for 5 or more of our net revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 8 of our net revenues we believe that the loss of any one of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the percentage of our total volume of requisitions and net revenues associated with our clinical laboratory testing business during 2005 applicable to each payer group 

 physicians 

physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral source of our clinical laboratory testing volume testing referred by physicians is typically billed to healthcare insurers government programs such as medicare and medicaid patients and physicians physicians are typically billed on a feeforservice basis based on negotiated fee schedules fees billed to patients and healthcare insurers are based on the laboratory’s patient fee schedule subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the healthcare insurers or with physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities 

healthcare insurers 

healthcare insurers including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers which typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of clinical laboratories on behalf of their members represent approximately one 

half of our total testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues larger healthcare insurers typically prefer to use large commercial clinical laboratories because they can provide services to their members on a national or regional basis in addition larger laboratories are better able to achieve the lowcost structures necessary to profitably service the members of large healthcare plans and can provide test utilization data across various products in a consistent format healthcare insurers frequently require test utilization data in order to meet the reporting requirements of the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to implement disease management programs and for other health plan operation purposes in certain markets such as california healthcare insurers may delegate their covered members to independent physician associations or ipas which in turn negotiate with laboratories for clinical laboratory services on behalf of their members 

in recent years healthcare insurers have begun to offer more freedom of choice to their members including greater freedom to determine which laboratory to use and which tests to order accordingly most of our agreements with major healthcare insurers are nonexclusive arrangements as a result under these nonexclusive arrangements physicians and patients have more freedom of choice in selecting laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on the basis of service and quality than they may otherwise also healthcare plans are increasingly offering programs such as preferred provider organizations or ppos and consumer driven health plans that offer a greater choice of healthcare providers pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under capitation arrangements if consumer driven plans and ppo plans increase in popularity it will be increasingly important for healthcare providers to differentiate themselves based on quality service and convenience to avoid competing on price alone despite these trends healthcare insurers continue to aggressively seek cost reductions in order to keep premiums to their customers competitive if the company is unable to agree on terms with a healthcare insurer we could become a “nonparticipating” provider which may require us to bill the patient or in certain cases the physician rather than the healthcare insurer this “nonparticipating” status could lead to loss of business since typically in these instances patients have a higher coinsurance responsibility and physicians may therefore not refer testing to a nonparticipating provider 

the trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers has continued resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these healthcare insurers as well as ipas demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements under these capitated payment arrangements we and healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of the healthcare insurer’s plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us some services such as various esoteric tests new technologies and anatomic pathology services may be carved out from a capitated rate and if carved out are charged on a feeforservice basis we work closely with healthcare insurers as they evaluate new tests however as innovation in the testing area increases there is no guarantee that healthcare insurers will agree to offer the technology as a covered service carve out these services or reimburse them at rates that reflect the true cost or value associated with such services 

historically most medicare beneficiaries were covered under the traditional medicare program but the federal government has over the last several years effected various proposals in an effort to increase enrollment of medicare beneficiaries in the private managed care system with the enactment of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma which renamed the private medicare program “medicare advantage” and created an additional product that allows for regional preferred provider organization it is possible that the company may begin to experience a shift of traditional medicare beneficiaries to private medicare advantage programs 

a significant portion of the laboratory costs incurred by healthcare insurers is for payments made to noncontracted providers primarily hospitals at rates exceeding those of contracted providers we offer questnet ä  a service whereby we develop and administer customized networks of clinical laboratory providers for healthcare insurers through questnet ä  physicians and members are provided multiple choices for clinical laboratory testing while healthcare insurers realize cost reductions from reducing testing performed by noncontracted providers 

hospitals 

hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing are typically negotiated on behalf of the hospitals by group purchasing organizations we believe that most hospital laboratories perform approximately 90 to 95 of their patients’ clinical laboratory tests we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states that vary from esoteric testing to helping manage their laboratories we believe that we are the industry’s market leader in servicing hospitals our hospital customers account for approximately 12 of our net revenues the majority of which represents services billed to the hospitals for certain testing that the hospitals do not perform internally hospitals continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity through test internalization as well as competing with commercial laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients 

testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s affiliated laboratory 

we have dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique needs of hospital customers we believe that the combination of fullservice bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals for consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be a partner of choice for hospital customers 

we have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships we also manage the laboratories at a number of other hospitals 

employers governmental institutions and other clinical laboratories 

we provide testing services to federal state and local governmental agencies and to large employers we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical laboratory testing to employers for drugs of abuse we also provide wellness testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in improving their health testing services for employers account for approximately 3 of our net revenues the volume of testing services for employers which generally have relatively low profit margins has increased moderately in 2005 driven by an increase in hiring we also perform esoteric testing services for other commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing capabilities all of these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis 

sales and marketing 

we market to and service our customers through our direct sales force healthplan sales force customer service representatives and couriers 

we focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable accounts we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth potential and profitability of all accounts 

our sales force is organized by customer type with the majority of representatives focused on marketing clinical laboratory testing and related services to physicians including specialty physicians such as oncologists urologists and gastroenterologists additionally we have a healthplan sales organization that focuses on regional and national insurance and healthcare organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on meeting the unique needs of hospitals and promotes the specialized capabilities of our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratories supporting our physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex tests a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling substanceofabuse and wellness testing to employers with the completion of the labone acquisition we now have a sales force that focuses on selling risk assessment testing services to life insurance companies 

customer service representatives perform a number of services for patients and customers they monitor services answer questions and help resolve problems our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily 

our corporate marketing function is organized by customer type and is responsible for developing and executing marketing strategies new product launches and promotional and advertising support 

information systems 

information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics and management of medical data the successful delivery of our services depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it systems it systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of root causes including telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are potentially exposed to physical or electronic breakin attempts computer viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures that we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems sustained or repeated system failures that would interrupt our ability 

to process test orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

historically acquired companies were often operated as local decentralized units and we did not standardize their billing laboratory or their other core information systems this resulted in many different information systems for billing test results reporting and other transactions 

during 2002 we began implementation of a standard laboratory information system and a standard billing system across all of our operations including those from our most recent acquisitions the deployment of standardized systems is continuing and we expect that it will take several years to complete it will result in significantly more centralized systems than we have even today and better control over the operational environment we expect the integration of these systems will improve operating efficiency and provide management with more timely and comprehensive information with which to make management decisions however failure or delays in properly implementing this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this magnitude workflow is reengineered to take advantage of best practices and enhanced system capabilities and may temporarily affect the delivery of our services in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed very carefully 

billing 

billing for laboratory services is complicated depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians and employer groups all of which have different billing requirements additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process other factors that complicate billing include 

 we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other factors medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity and costs to our operations changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process 

we believe that most of our bad debt expense which was 42 of our net revenues in 2005 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or missing we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense see “regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” 

competition 

while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing industry in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive we primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories we are the leading clinical laboratory testing provider in the united states with net revenues of 55 billion during 2005 and facilities in substantially all of the country’s major metropolitan areas our largest competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in addition 

we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories specialized esoteric labs as well as laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals see “payers and customers” 

we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a laboratory including 

 we believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas 

we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers and members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing industry will continue however a majority of the clinical laboratory testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us see “payers and customers– hospitals” as a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories and 3 home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of clinical laboratories development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our net revenues see “regulation of clinical laboratory operations” 

quality assurance 

our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry our nichols institute facility in san juan capistrano was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve iso certification two of our clinical trials laboratories our diagnostic kits facility and two of our routine laboratories are also iso certified these certifications are international standards for quality management systems 

internal proficiency testing quality control and audits quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to identify trends biases or imprecision in our analytical processes we also perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program 

external proficiency testing and accreditation all of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include but are not limited to proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american pathologists or cap as well as some state agencies 

cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of board certified pathologists cap is approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or clia cap offers an accreditation program to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of 

our major regional laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program “cap whistle blower” hotline posters which are used to escalate unresolved quality and laboratory safety concerns to cap are posted in all of our cap accredited laboratories 

regulation of clinical laboratory operations 

the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and state regulation including inspections and audits by governmental agencies governmental authorities may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other actions to enforce laws and regulations including revoking a clinical laboratory’s federal certification which is required to operate a clinical laboratory operation changes in regulations may i increase our operating costs including but not limited to those costs associated with performing clinical laboratory tests and administrative requirements related to billing or ii decrease the amount of reimbursement related to testing services performed 

clia and state regulation all of our laboratories and where applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law for example state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing the cost of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling to both physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their homes 

drug testing the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa regulates drug testing for public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses samhsa has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to perform drug testing on these employees all laboratories that perform such testing must be certified as meeting samhsa standards all of our laboratories that perform such testing are certified as meeting samhsa standards 

controlled substances the federal drug enforcement administration or dea regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse testing to obtain access to controlled substances laboratories must be licensed by the dea all of our laboratories that use controlled substances are licensed by the dea 

medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical laboratories are also subject to federal state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of such waste 

fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over laboratorydeveloped tests but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating most laboratorydeveloped tests performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories in december 2000 the department of health and human services or hhs secretary’s advisory committee on genetic testing recommended that the fda be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing in late 2002 a new hhs secretary’s advisory committee on genetics health and society or sacghs was appointed to replace the prior advisory committee in june 2004 sacghs announced that its priorities included overview of the oversight of genetic technologies ultimately sacghs decided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies but it did not believe that further action was warranted in the meantime the fda is considering revising its regulations on analyte specific reagents which are used in laboratorydeveloped tests including laboratorydeveloped genetic testing fda interest in or actual regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing could lead to periodic inquiry letters from the fda and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests representatives of clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics and the american clinical laboratory association our industry trade association or acla have communicated industry concerns to representatives of the fda regarding potential fda regulation of genetic testing in general and issues with regard to the impact of potential increased oversight over analyte specific reagents we expect those discussions to continue 

occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health administration or osha has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers this includes requirements to 

develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick injuries 

specimen transportation transportation of most clinical laboratory specimens and some laboratory supplies are considered hazardous materials subject to regulation by the department of transportation the public health service the united states postal service and the international air transport association 

corporate practice of medicine many states including some in which our principal laboratories are located prohibit corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine the corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been interpreted in certain states to prohibit corporations from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on the corporation’s behalf the scope of the doctrine and how it applies varies from state to state in certain states these restrictions affect our ability to directly provide anatomic pathology services andor to provide clinical laboratory services directly to consumers 

healthcare information technology 

clinical laboratories use information technology to obtain laboratory orders and to communicate results and provide other laboratory reporting innovations in healthcare information technology or hcit have the potential to improve patient care promote efficiency and reduce expense both at the federal and state levels there are public and private efforts to bring together healthcare providers information technology vendors and other stakeholders to coordinate federal healthcare information standards and develop a national healthcare network including adopting standard code sets and developing standards for electronic interoperability standards for the exchange and use of electronic healthcare data 

we and medplus our hcit subsidiary could be impacted by any national healthcare information network and the adoption of standards for hcit interoperability because of substantial existing investments in software and hardware and the potential for having to make substantial future investments to comply with new or different standards on october 11 2005 as required by the mma the office of the inspector general or oig published a proposed safe harbor to the federal antikickback statute and cms published proposed exceptions to the stark selfreferral prohibition law that would permit certain providers other than clinical laboratories to provide eprescribing items and services to physicians for free if these regulations are adopted as proposed certain providers would be able to provide broader packages of hcit items or services than clinical laboratories which could create incentives for some customers to choose such providers we are commenting on the proposed rules through our industry trade association acla reflecting our position that if any providers are permitted to be donors of eprescribing or ehr items or services then all providers should be entitled to the same protections afforded by the proposed safe harbor and selfreferral prohibition exceptions 

we and acla our trade association are monitoring standards development proposed legislation and rulemaking proceedings and we are providing relevant information to policy makers to ensure that issues important to medical laboratories are reflected in any interoperability standards hcit legislation and proposed regulations 

privacy and security of health information standard transactions 

pursuant to hipaa the secretary of hhs has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged three principal regulations have been issued in final form privacy regulations security regulations and standards for electronic transactions 

the hipaa privacy regulations which fully came into effect in april 2003 establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including 

 13 

 we have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy regulations the hipaa privacy regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws in addition for healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries we need to comply with the laws of other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the final privacy regulations the privacy regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information 

the final hipaa security regulations which establish requirements for safeguarding electronic patient information were published on february 20 2003 and became effective on april 21 2003 although healthcare providers had until april 20 2005 to comply we have implemented policies and standards to reasonably and appropriately comply with the requirements of the regulations 

the final hipaa regulations for electronic transactions which we refer to as the transaction standards establish uniform standards for electronic transactions and code sets including the electronic transactions and code sets used for billing claims remittance advices enrollment and eligibility hhs issued guidance on july 24 2003 stating that it would not penalize a covered entity for postimplementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the transactions standards if the covered entity could demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the standards however beginning october 1 2005 cms no longer processes incoming nonhipaa compliant electronic medicare claims 

many of our payers were not ready to implement the transaction standards by the october 2003 compliance deadline or were not ready to test or troubleshoot claims submissions since that time significant progress has been made in implementing the transaction standards with our payers as of december 31 2005 we are substantially complete with the conversion to the required standard format for our electronic feeforservice claim transactions and our electronic feeforservice remittance transactions in september 2005 as part of hipaa administrative simplification hhs published a notice of proposed rulemaking on standards for electronic health care claims attachments we are commenting on this proposal through acla our industry trade association and final rule publication from hhs is not anticipated prior to mid2006 upon final rule publication the implementation period for electronic health care claim attachments is anticipated to be two years at a minimum 

the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in interpretation by payers for instance some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians we are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissions and with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations 

regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services 

overview the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in reimbursement practices during the past several years government payers such as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and medicaid which principally serves indigent patients as well as private payers and large employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical laboratory services if we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor introducing new procedures it could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability 

while the total cost to comply with medicare administrative requirements is disproportionate to our cost to bill other payers average medicare reimbursement rates are not materially different than our overall average reimbursement rate from all payers making this business generally less profitable despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare and medicaid programs we continue to participate in such programs because we believe that our other business may depend in part on continued participation in these programs since certain customers may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services regardless of who pays for such services 

billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate some or all of a clinical laboratory’s business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per violation plus up to three times the amount claimed 

reduced reimbursements in 1984 congress established a medicare fee schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for patients covered under part b of the medicare program congress then imposed a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local medicare fee schedules since then congress has periodically reduced the national ceilings the medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced in 1996 to 76 of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in 1998 to 74 of the 1984 national median the national ceiling applies to tests for which limitation amounts were established before january 1 2001 for more recent tests tests for which a limitation amount is first established on or after january 1 2001 the limitation amount is set at 100 of the median of all the local fee schedules established for that test in accordance with the social security act the mma eliminated for five years beginning january 1 2004 the provision for annual increases to the medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer price index thus by law an adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical laboratory services based on the consumer price index cannot occur before january 1 2009 however the mma added coverage for certain cardiovascular screening tests and diabetes screening tests subject to certain frequency limitations the mma evaluates new diagnostic tests for coverage as they are introduced in addition the 2005 physician fee schedule rule proposed to lower medicare’s payment rates for flow cytometry services in 2005 quest diagnostics believed that cms failed to properly value these services and commented on this proposed change through acla pathology services are reimbursed by medicare according to a physician fee schedule based on a resourcebased relative value scale or rbrvs that is periodically updated by cms on november 21 2005 cms published its final physician fee schedule rule effective january 1 2006 but did not implement any changes to the practice expense values in the new fee schedule leaving the lower reimbursement for flow cytometry in place for 2006 in addition the formula used for rbrvs calls for a 44 reduction in the 2006 payment level for physicians services including anatomic pathology services payable to clinical laboratories in february 2006 congress eliminated the 44 reduction in the 2006 physician fee schedule keeping the reimbursement for physician services including anatomic pathology services billed by clinical laboratories unchanged from 2005 approximately 1 of our net revenues are derived from pathology services reimbursed by medicare based on rbrvs 

with regard to the clinical laboratory services performed on behalf of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the carrier’s fee schedule amount as payment in full in addition state medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than medicare major clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics typically use two fee schedules for tests billed on a feeforservice basis 

 the fee schedule amounts established by medicare are typically substantially lower than patient fees otherwise charged by us but are sometimes higher than our fees actually charged to certain clients during 1992 the oig of the hhs issued final regulations that prohibited charging medicare fees substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges the laboratory industry believes that the term “usual charges” specifically applies to amounts charged to similarlysituated thirdparty payers and to patients and that client fees should not be included in “usual charges” the oig however declined to provide any guidance concerning interpretation of these rules including whether or not discounts to nongovernmental clients and payers or the dualfee structure might be inconsistent with these rules 

a proposed rule released in september 1997 would have authorized the oig to exclude providers from participation in the medicare program including clinical laboratories that charge medicare and other programs fees that are “substantially in excess of    usual charges    to any of their customers clients or patients” this proposal was withdrawn by the oig in 1998 in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion which indicated that a clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the “usual charges” regulation if the “charge to medicare substantially exceeds the amount the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept from nonfederal payers” the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to private pay customers 

in september 2003 the oig published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the oig’s exclusion regulations addressing excessive claims under the proposed exclusion rule the oig would have the authority to exclude a provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are substantially in excess of the provider’s usual charges the proposal would define “usual charges” as the average payment from nongovernment entities on a test by test basis excluding capitated payments and would define “substantially in excess” to be an amount that is more than 20 greater than the usual charge we believe that the rule is unnecessary for the clinical laboratory industry because congress has already established fee schedules for the services that the rule proposes to regulate we also believe that the rule is unworkable and overly burdensome through our industry trade association we filed comments opposing the proposed rule and we are working with our trade association and a coalition of other healthcare providers who also oppose this proposed regulation as drafted if this regulation is adopted as proposed it could potentially reduce the amounts we bill and collect from medicare and other federal payers affect the fees we charge to other payers or subject the company to penalties for noncompliance and could also be costly for us to administer 

the 1997 balanced budget act permits cms to adjust statutorily prescribed fees for some medical services including clinical laboratory services if the fees are “grossly excessive” in december 2002 cms issued an interim final rule setting forth a process and factors for establishing a “realistic and equitable” payment amount for all medicare part b services except physician services and services paid under a prospective payment system when the existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be considered unreasonable because they are either grossly excessive or deficient in december 2005 cms published the final rule clarifying that if cms or a carrier determines that an overall payment adjustment of less than 15 is needed to produce a realistic and equitable payment amount then the payment amount is not considered “grossly excessive or deficient” however if a determination is made that a payment adjustment of 15 or more is justified cms could provide an adjustment of less than 15 but not more than 15 in any given year we cannot provide any assurances to investors that fees payable by medicare could not be reduced as a result of the application of this rule or that the government might not assert claims for reimbursement by purporting to retroactively apply this rule or the oig interpretation concerning “usual charges” 

currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for clinical laboratory testing when copayments were last in effect before adoption of the clinical laboratory services fee schedules in 1984 clinical laboratories received from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed amount and were required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid balance of the medicare allowed amount if reenacted a copayment requirement could adversely affect the revenues of the clinical laboratory industry including us by exposing the testing laboratory to the credit of individuals and by increasing the number of bills in addition a laboratory could be subject to potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate procedures to bill and collect the copayments are not established and followed the medicare reform bill approved by the united states senate in june 2003 included a copayment provision under which clinical laboratories would receive from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed amount for clinical laboratory tests and would be required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the 20 balance of the medicare allowed amount the copayment provision was dropped from the bill as passed known as the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 we cannot provide any assurances to investors that congress would not seek to reimpose a copayment requirement payable by medicare beneficiaries for clinical laboratory services certain medicaid programs already require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for clinical laboratory testing 

reduced utilization of clinical laboratory testing in recent years cms has taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory testing since 1995 medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients however cms has not prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide this diagnostic information to laboratories moreover regulations adopted in accordance with hipaa require submission of diagnosis codes as part of the standard claims transaction 

we are generally permitted to bill patients directly for some statutorily excluded clinical laboratory services if a patient signs an advance beneficiary notice or abn we are also generally permitted to bill patients for clinical laboratory tests that medicare does not cover due to “medical necessity” limitations these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by medicare an abn is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patient’s informed decision to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which are likely to be denied and not reimbursed by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically necessary we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the physician’s office staff if the abn is not timely provided to the beneficiary or is not completed properly we may end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient if they are not reimbursable by medicare due to coverage limitations 

inconsistent practices currently many different local carriers administer medicare they have inconsistent policies on matters such as 1 test coverage 2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims documentation and 5 fee schedules subject to the national fee schedule limitations inconsistent carrier rules and policies have increased the complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories as part of the 1997 balanced budget act hhs was required to adopt uniform policies on the above matters by january 1 1999 and to replace the current local carriers with no more than five regional carriers although hhs has finalized a number of uniform test coveragediagnosis coding policies it has not taken any final action to replace the local carriers with five regional carriers 

carrier jurisdiction changes for labtolab referrals on october 31 2003 cms announced its intention to change the manner in which medicare contractors currently process claims for labtolab referrals of clinical laboratory tests while laboratories are under certain criteria permitted to directly bill medicare for clinical laboratory tests they refer to other laboratories they must be reimbursed at the correct fee schedule amount based on the medicare fee schedule in effect in the medicare carrier region in which the test was actually performed historically laboratories needed to enroll with and file claims to multiple carriers in order to bill for such outofarea test referrals to ensure receipt of the appropriate payment amount this has proven to be an administratively difficult process with many obstacles to obtaining accurate claims payment including applying the correct fee schedule on july 1 2004 cms implemented a change that mandated that the laboratory’s “home” carrier maintain and apply the clinical laboratory fee schedule applicable to the carrier region where the test was performed this streamlined process allows a laboratory to file all of its clinical laboratory claims to its “home” carrier 

cms also has announced a parallel change with regard to purchased diagnostic interpretations pathology services a previously announced change in medicare carrier jurisdiction rules required laboratories to bill the carrier where a purchased diagnostic interpretation service was performed this would have required carriers to issue medicare provider numbers to the billing laboratory in october 2004 cms posted a “change notice” permitting laboratories to temporarily bill their local carriers for purchased diagnostic tests or interpretations regardless of the location where the service was furnished the final change notice was issued on october 29 2004 effective april 1 2005 the final notice requires carriers to implement a new edit to check for duplicate claims for referred clinical diagnostic laboratory and purchased diagnostic services submitted by physicianssuppliers to more than one carrier 

competitive bidding the mma requires cms to conduct two demonstration projects of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory tests cms awarded the clinical laboratory competitive bidding demonstration design and implementation contract to rti international research triangle park north carolina and its subcontractor palmetto gba palmetto is a part b carrier and previously conducted for cms a competitive bidding demonstration for durable medical equipment dme in august 2005 rti presented its draft design at a public meeting the rti proposal incorporated several acla recommendations including having bidders bid on the full range of tests paid under the laboratory fee schedule utilizing a feeforservice basis for bidding and allowing bidders to subcontract cms has not made any final decisions on the rti draft design but was required to submit its initial report on the competitive bidding proposal by december 31 2005 cms’ status report is currently in the clearance process at cms and has not yet been submitted to congress the president’s 2007 budget proposal presented in january 2006 included cost savings from competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services the budget proposal did not contain substantive details acla the trade association for the clinical laboratory industry issued a press release commenting negatively on the budget proposal quest diagnostics and acla will monitor the design and implementation phase of the competitive bidding pilot and the congressional reaction to the 2007 budget proposal the diagnostic testing industry is concerned that the competitive bidding demonstrations or nationwide expansion of competitive bidding will not take into account all of the factors involved in the timely delivery of high quality clinical laboratory testing to a broad range of clients in diverse geographic settings 

in december 2004 the state of florida issued an invitation to negotiate itn seeking competitive bids for the provision of clinical laboratory tests on a capitatedbasis for some medicaid recipients and on a reduced feeforservice basis for other medicaid recipients the itn contemplates that the florida medicaid agency ahca will negotiate with the three highestscoring bidders for an exclusive statewide contract of at least three years plus a potential renewal period acla the industry trade association for clinical laboratories filed two petitions with ahca challenging the itn on public policy and legal grounds in addition quest diagnostics and another large laboratory independently filed bid protests with ahca on february 18 2005 ahca announced without further explanation that it was withdrawing the itn ahca has not yet reissued its itn if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical laboratory testing it could materially adversely affect the clinical laboratory industry and us 

future legislation future changes in federal state and local regulations or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely affect us we cannot predict however whether and what type of legislative proposals will be enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by regulatory authorities 

fraud and abuse regulations medicare and medicaid antikickback laws prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or other federal programs as noted above the penalties for violation of these laws may include criminal and civil fines and penalties andor suspension or exclusion from participation in federal programs many of the antifraud statutes and regulations including those relating to joint ventures and alliances are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot predict if some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted contrary to our practices 

in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion concluding that the industry practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if the discounted price is below a laboratory’s overall cost including overhead and below the amounts reimbursed by medicare advisory opinions are not binding but may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement actions the oig’s opinion if enforced could result in fines and possible exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below the rates reimbursed by medicare the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se violation of the federal antikickback statute but may merit further investigation depending on the facts and circumstances presented 

in addition since 1992 a federal anti“selfreferral” law commonly known as the “stark” law prohibits with certain exceptions medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who have personally or through a family member an investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with the testing laboratory since january 1995 these restrictions have also applied to medicaidcovered services many states have similar anti“selfreferral” and other laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians we cannot predict if some of the state laws will be interpreted contrary to our practices 

in april 2003 the oig issued a special advisory bulletin addressing what it described as “questionable contractual arrangements” in contractual joint ventures the oig bulletin focused on arrangements where a healthcare provider or owner expands into a related healthcare business by contracting with a healthcare provider or manager that already is engaged in that line of business for the manager to provide related healthcare items or services to the patients of the owner in return for a share of the profits of the new line of business while we believe that the bulletin is directed at “sham” arrangements intended to induce referrals we cannot predict whether the oig might choose to investigate all contractual joint ventures including our joint ventures with various hospitals or hospital systems 

government investigations and related claims 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with government settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our billing practices if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and additional liabilities from third party claims in addition certain federal and state statues including the qui tam provisions of the federal false claim act allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices 

during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled significant government claims that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both companies believed to be lawful the federal or state governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 18 of our net revenues during 2005 

we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential liability we are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act and other federal and state statutes these lawsuits include class action and individual claims by patients arising out of the company’s billing policies in addition we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 quest diagnostics incorporated and nichols institute diagnostics nid our test kit manufacturing subsidiary each received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york quest diagnostics and nid have been cooperating with the united states attorney’s office in connection with such cooperation we have been providing information and producing various business records of nid and quest diagnostics including documents related to testing and test kits manufactured by nid this investigation by the united states attorney’s office could lead to civil and criminal damages fines and penalties and additional liabilities from third party claims in the second and third quarters of 2005 the fda conducted an inspection of nid and issued a form 483 listing the observations made by the fda during the course of the inspection nid is cooperating with the fda and has filed its responses to the form 483 noncompliance with the fda regulatory requirements or failure to take adequate and timely corrective action could lead to regulatory or enforcement action against nid andor quest diagnostics including but not limited to a warning letter injunction suspension of production andor distribution seizure or recall of products fines or penalties denial of premarket clearance for new or changed products recommendation against award of government contracts and criminal prosecution 

during the second quarter of 2005 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the district of new jersey the subpoena seeks the production of business and financial records regarding capitation and risk sharing arrangements with government and private payers for the years 1993 through 1999 also during the third quarter of 2005 we received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of the inspector general the subpoena seeks the production of various business records including records regarding our relationship with health maintenance organizations independent physician associations group purchasing organizations and preferred provider organizations from 1995 to the present we are cooperating with the united states attorney’s office and the office of the inspector general 

although management cannot predict the outcome of such matters management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

as an integral part of our compliance program discussed below we investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient 

compliance program 

compliance with all government rules and regulations has become a significant concern throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of evolving interpretations of regulations and the emerging changes in laboratory science and healthcare technology we established a compliance program early in 1993 

we emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures personnel and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations the quality safety  compliance committee of the board of directors requires periodic reporting of compliance operations from management 

we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot assure investors that applicable statutes or regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect us potential sanctions for violation of these statutes include significant damages penalties and fines exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorization necessary to operate some or all of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

intellectual property rights 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 19 

 patents generally are not issued until several years after an application is filed the possibility that before a patent is issued to a third party we may be performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense to an infringement claim thus even tests that we develop could become the subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those tests 

infringement and other intellectual property claims regardless of their merit can be expensive and timeconsuming to litigate in addition any requirement to reengineer our tests or change our business processes could substantially increase our costs force us to interrupt product sales or delay new test releases in the past we have settled several disputes regarding our alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties we are currently involved in settling several additional disputes we do not believe that resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however infringement claims could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing 

insurance 

as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims some of these suits involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the basis for claims reserves considers actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience management believes that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures although management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the company management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or paid similarly although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we employed approximately 41500 people this total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good 




 item 1a risk factors 

efforts by third party payers including the government to reduce utilization and pricing could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

government payers such as medicare and medicaid as well as private payers and larger employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical laboratory services the center for medicare and medicaid services or cms formerly the health care financing administration has over the years sought to control clinical laboratory expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs through various means including reimbursement rate reductions measures designed to control overutilization by some physicians and limited coverage policies for a more detailed description of the developments in government regulations we urge investors to read “business  regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” 

in november 2003 the house of representatives and the united states senate passed a medicare reform bill that includes a fiveyear freeze on adjustments to the medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer price index congressional budget reconciliation efforts could result in further reductions in medicare andor medicaid expenditures for laboratory services in 2006 in addition as required by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma cms will conduct two demonstration projects of competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services the impact of competitive bidding on our revenues is not known and is impossible to accurately predict furthermore on january 1 2006 cms began implementing medicare part d in accordance with the mma cms has projected that a sizeable percentage of traditional medicare beneficiaries will shift into new private health plans medicare advantage it is not known and we cannot predict the impact that a shift from traditional medicare feeforservice to medicare advantage may have on our revenues 

the healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power in negotiating fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these healthcare insurers as well as independent physician associations demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements under capitated payment arrangements clinical laboratories receive a fixed monthly fee per enrolled individual for all laboratory tests performed during the month regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed although some services such as various esoteric tests new technologies and anatomic pathology services may be carved out from a capitated arrangement services that are carved out from a capitated arrangement are charged on a feeforservice basis we work closely with healthcare insurers as they evaluate new tests however as innovation in the testing area increases there is no guarantee that healthcare insurers will agree to offer new tests as a covered service reimburse them at rates that reflect the true cost or value associated with such services or carve out these services from capitated arrangements 

efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers may continue if we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor introducing new procedures our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected 

in september 2003 the office of the inspector general or oig published a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that would amend the oig’s exclusion regulations addressing claims containing “excessive charges” under the exclusion rule the oig has the authority to exclude a provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are substantially in excess of the provider’s usual charges the proposal would define “substantially in excess” and “usual charges” and clarify the “good cause” exception to the existing exclusion rule we believe that the proposed regulation is flawed and are working with the american clinical laboratory association acla our industry trade association and a coalition of other healthcare providers to oppose this proposed regulation as drafted if this regulation is adopted as proposed it could potentially reduce the amounts reimbursed to us by medicare and other federal payers or affect the fees charged to other payers by us for additional information see “business  regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services” 

if we fail to comply with extensive laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with government settlements and public announcements by various government officials the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations including our pricing andor billing practices if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and additional liabilities from thirdparty claims 

during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled government claims that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both companies believed to be lawful the aggregate amount of the settlements for these claims exceeded 500 million the federal or state governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented approximately 18 of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 

we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistle blowers” as to which we have not been provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential liability we are also aware of certain pending lawsuits related to billing practices filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil false claims act and other federal and state statutes these lawsuits include class action and individual claims by patients arising out of the company’s billing practices in addition we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount

although management cannot predict the outcome of such matters management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid 

the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely furthermore clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law some state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing intentional and serious failures to comply with these requirements can lead to loss of licenses exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs fines and other penalties 

billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in the medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate some or all of a clinical laboratory’s business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per violation plus up to three times the amount claimed 

as an integral part of our compliance program we investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient 

failure in our information technology systems including failures resulting from our systems conversions or failures to adapt existing systems to proposed health information technology hit standards could significantly increase turnaround time otherwise disrupt our operations or lead to increased competition by other providers of laboratory services all of which could reduce our customer base and result in lost net revenues 

information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it systems it systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process test orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues 

during 2002 we began implementation of a standard laboratory information system and a standard billing system the deployment of standardized systems is continuing and we expect that it will take several years to complete and will result in significantly more centralized systems than we have today failure to properly implement this standardization process could materially adversely affect our business during system conversions of this type workflow may be reengineered to take advantage of enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully 

in addition public and private initiatives at the federal state and regional levels to create hit standards for the electronic exchange of clinical information including laboratory results could require costly modifications to our existing it systems while we do not expect hit standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply with new standards failure or delay in implementing hit interoperability standards or in adopting and incorporating standardized clinical coding systems in our it systems could result in a loss of customers a loss of business opportunities and could adversely affect our reputation on october 11 2005 the oig and cms published separate nprms intended to create incentives to foster the quicker adoption of hit by physicians the oig issued a proposed “safe harbor” exception from the federal antikickback laws for certain electronic eprescribing arrangements and cms issued a virtually identical proposed exception to the federal selfreferral prohibition laws with regard to these same types of eprescribing arrangements in addition cms issued proposed exceptions to the federal selfreferral prohibition laws with regard to certain electronic health record ehr arrangements if these regulations are adopted as proposed certain providers other than clinical laboratories would be able to provide broader packages of hit items or services than laboratories which could create incentives for some customers to choose such providers we are commenting on the proposed rules through our industry trade association acla reflecting our position that if any providers are permitted to be donors of eprescribing or ehr items or services then all providers should be entitled to the same protections afforded by the proposed safe harbor and selfreferral prohibition exceptions 

integrating our operations with labone may be difficult and if unsuccessfully executed may have a material adverse effect on our business 

on november 1 2005 we completed the acquisition of labone in a transaction valued at approximately 947 million including approximately 138 million of assumed debt of labone labone reported revenues of 468 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that previously operated independently and has different systems processes and cultures the process of combining labone with our operations may be disruptive to both of our businesses and may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in such businesses as a result of the following difficulties among others 

 in addition because most of our clinical laboratory testing is performed under arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice any such interruption of or deterioration in our services may result in a customer’s decision to stop using us for clinical laboratory testing we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain key technical and management personnel or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the labone acquisition either at all or in a timely manner additionally as part of our growth strategy we may in the future acquire additional clinical laboratories or other healthcarerelated businesses which could have integration risks 

the acquisition of labone may not produce the anticipated benefits 

even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of labone we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration we expect the acquisition to generate annual synergies of approximately 30 million upon the completion of integration which is expected to occur within two years of closing however there can be no assurance that such synergies will be realized 

failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and bad debt expense 

billing for laboratory services is extremely complicated we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers we consider a “payer” to be the party that pays for the test and a “customer” to be the party who refers the test to us depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid physicians and employer groups all of which have different billing requirements additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process among many other factors complicating billing are 

 we incur additional costs as a result of our participation in medicare and medicaid programs as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other factors medical necessity denials and advanced beneficiary notices compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity and costs to the billing process changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients cms establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process 

we believe that much of our bad debt expense which was 42 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers and the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility rather than credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or missing we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense 

our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 16 billion of debt outstanding with approximately 740 million of available capacity under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and secured receivables credit facility except for outstanding letters of credit and operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements in place or available see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details related to our outstanding debt set forth in the table below for each of the next five years is the aggregate amount of scheduled principal estimated interest and total payments with respect to our debt outstanding as of december 31 2005 including capital leases assuming that maturing debt is refinanced for purposes of estimating interest 

 our debt portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 142 million of floating rate debt based on our net exposure to interest rate changes an assumed 10 change in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness representing approximately 44 basis points would impact annual net interest expense by approximately 06 million assuming no changes to the debt outstanding at december 31 2005 in addition any future borrowings by us under the unsecured revolving credit facility the secured receivables credit facility or the issuance of other floating rate debt will expose us to additional interest rate risk interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility term loan and secured receivables credit facility are also subject to a pricing schedule that fluctuates based on changes in our credit rating 

our 6¾ senior notes which have an aggregate principal amount of 275 million outstanding mature in july 2006 we may repay the notes with cash on hand or refinance the notes with borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables credit facility or other financing arrangements 

our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants these restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt 

we have obtained ratings on our debt from standard and poor’s and moody’s investors service there can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes in our company or our industry so warrant if such ratings are lowered the borrowing costs on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility secured receivables facility and term loan would increase changes in our credit ratings do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt 

we or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future if additional debt is added to our current debt a greater portion of our cash flows will be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements we may need to seek additional financing in this case it may be more difficult or we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us as a result we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness 

professional liability litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation 

as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims some of these suits involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability litigation could have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation we maintain various liability insurance programs for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the basis for claims reserves considers actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience management believes that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures although management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the company management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which the impact of such claims is determined or paid similarly although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 

failure to provide a higher quality of service than that of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

while there has been significant consolidation in recent years in the clinical laboratory testing business it remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a laboratory including 

 we believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas 

we primarily compete with three types of laboratory providers—hospitalaffiliated laboratories other independent clinical laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing on their patients in addition many hospitals compete with independent clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical practice and many hospitals leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital’s laboratory as a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians we compete against hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily based on quality of service our failure to provide service superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability 

regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions” for healthcare services issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 

pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the secretary of the department of health and human services or hhs has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged three principal regulations have been issued in final form standards for electronic transactions security regulations and privacy regulations 

the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in interpretation by payers for instance some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians while most of our transactions are submitted and  or received in ansi standard format inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing in addition new requirements for additional standard transactions such as claims attachments could prove technically difficult timeconsuming or expensive to implement we are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissions and with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations 

compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs 

the hipaa privacy and security regulations which became fully effective in april 2003 and april 2005 respectively establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of protected health information the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including 

 we have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy and security regulations as required by law the privacy regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state privacy laws in addition for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries we must comply with the laws of those other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information 

compliance with all of the hipaa regulations including new standard transactions requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations not just quest diagnostics while we believe our total costs to comply with hipaa will not be material to our operations or cash flows new standard transactions and additional customer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us 

fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests analyte specific reagents or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests 

the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over laboratorydeveloped tests but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests performed by high complexity cliacertified laboratories in december 2000 the hhs secretary’s advisory committee on genetic testing recommended that the fda be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing in late 2002 a new hhs secretary’s advisory committee on genetics health and society or sacghs was appointed to replace the prior advisory committee ultimately sacghs decided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies but it did not believe that further action was warranted in the meantime the fda is considering revising its regulations on analyte specific reagents which are used in laboratorydeveloped tests including laboratorydeveloped genetic testing representatives of clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics and the american clinical laboratory association our industry trade association have met with representatives of the fda to address industry issues pertaining to potential fda regulation of genetic testing in general and issues with regard to increased oversight over the analyte specific reagents used in laboratorydeveloped tests in particular we expect those discussions to continue fda interest in or actual regulation of laboratorydeveloped tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratorydeveloped testing could lead to periodic inquiry letters from the fda and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests including genetic tests 

the development of new more costeffective tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices or by patients could negatively impact our testing volume and net revenues 

the diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of an independent clinical laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or 3 home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes or by physicians in their offices development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratorybased testing services and negatively impact our net revenues currently most of our clinical laboratory testing is categorized as “high” or “moderate” complexity and thereby subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point of care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home use to both physicians and patients diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the fda for over the counter otc or prescription home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight as well as by patients in their homes the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and the secretary of hhs has delegated to the fda the authority to determine whether particular tests waived tests are “simple” and have “an insignificant risk of an erroneous result” under clia increased approval of otc or home test kits andor increased numbers and types of waived tests could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices which could affect our market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact our net revenues 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities 

our operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services in addition such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens or to receive materials from our suppliers 

our tests and business processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others which could cause us to engage in costly litigation pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling certain of our tests 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to do one or more of the following 

 patents generally are not issued until several years after an application is filed the possibility that before a patent is issued to a third party we may be performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense to an infringement claim thus even tests that we develop could become the subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those tests 

infringement and other intellectual property claims regardless of their merit can be expensive and timeconsuming to litigate in addition any requirement to reengineer our tests or change our business processes could substantially increase our costs force us to interrupt product sales or delay new test releases in the past we have settled several disputes regarding our alleged infringement of intellectual property of third parties we are currently involved in settling several additional disputes we do not believe that resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition however infringement claims could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as genebased testing and other specialty testing 

our organizational documents and other agreements contain restrictions that might prevent a takeover or change in management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws might have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting a takeover on terms that some shareholders might favor reducing the opportunity for shareholders to sell shares at a premium over thenprevailing market prices and prevent or frustrate attempts to replace or remove current management these provisions include 

 in addition we have a shareholder rights plan which grants shareholders other than the acquiring person the right to purchase common stock at onehalf of market price if any person becomes the beneficial owner of 20 or more of the outstanding shares of common stock subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan

the united states clinical laboratory testing market

          clinical laboratory testing is an essential element in the delivery of
healthcare services physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection
diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical
conditions clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized as clinical
testing and anatomic pathology testing clinical testing is performed on body
fluids such as blood and urine anatomic pathology testing is performed on
tissues and other samples such as human cells most clinical laboratory tests
are considered routine and can be performed by most commercial clinical
laboratories tests that are not routine and that require more sophisticated
equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric tests esoteric
tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that
specialize in performing those tests

          we believe that the united states clinical laboratory testing market
approximated 40 billion in annual revenues in 2004 most laboratory tests are
performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical
laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice
laboratories in 2004 we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories
accounted for approximately 60 of the market commercial clinical laboratories
approximately onethird and physicianoffice laboratories the balance

          the underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry have
improved since the early to mid1990s since that time there has been
significant industry consolidation particularly among commercial laboratories
resulting in fewer but larger commercial laboratories with greater economies of
scale better equipped to service the members of large healthcare plans and
more disciplined in their approach to operating their business orders for
laboratory testing are generated from physician offices hospitals and
employers as such factors including changes in the united states economy which
can affect





page


the number of unemployed and uninsured and design changes in healthcare plans
which impact the number of physician office and hospital visits can impact the
utilization of laboratory testing

          while the diagnostic testing industry may be impacted by a number of
factors we believe it will continue to grow over the long term as a result of
the following

          o  the growing and aging population of the united states

          o  continuing research and development in the area of genomics the
             study of dna genes and chromosomes and proteomics the analysis
             of individual proteins and collections of proteins which is
             expected to yield new more sophisticated and specialized
             diagnostics tests

          o  increasing recognition by consumers and payers of the value of
             laboratory testing as a means to improve health and reduce the
             overall cost of healthcare through early detection and
             prevention and

          o  increasing affordability of and access to tests due to advances
             in technology and cost efficiencies


corporate strategy and growth opportunities

          our mission is to be the undisputed world leader in diagnostic
testing information and services we focus on patients growth and people to
help achieve our goals

          patients are at the center of everything we do increasingly patients
and their doctors have a choice when it comes to selecting a healthcare
provider and we strive to give them new and compelling reasons to put their
trust in us we differentiate our company to patients and doctors by

          o  providing the highest quality services we continue to implement
             six sigma initiatives throughout all aspects of our organization
             and we are utilizing lean six sigma principles to further
             increase the efficiency of our operations six sigma is a
             management approach that enhances quality and requires a thorough
             understanding of customer needs and requirements root cause
             analysis process improvements and rigorous tracking and
             measuring lean six sigma streamlines processes and eliminates
             waste we have integrated our six sigma initiative with our
             initiative to standardize operations and processes across the
             company by adopting identified company best practices
             additionally we are focusing our six sigma resources on
             improving all aspects of our interactions with patients and
             customers this goes beyond ordering tests and getting results 
             it also covers our couriers picking up samples phlebotomists
             drawing blood medical staff performing the tests and providing
             consultations and interactions during the billing cycle

          o  offering unparalleled access and distribution we are the leader
             in the clinical laboratory testing business offering the broadest
             test menu and national access to testing services with
             facilities in substantially all of the major metropolitan areas
             in the united states we operate a nationwide network of greater
             than 1900 patient service centers principal laboratories
             located in more than 30 major metropolitan areas throughout the
             united states and about 140 smaller rapid response laboratories
             that enable us to serve patients physicians hospitals
             employers and other healthcare providers throughout the united
             states we believe that customers will increasingly seek to
             utilize laboratorytesting providers that offer a comprehensive
             range of tests and services and the most convenient access to
             those services

          growth will be driven organically and through acquisition we expect
to grow organically at or above the industry growth rate by gaining more
customers and selling more to existing customers historically our industry has
focused primarily on service levels and aggressive pricing to drive organic
growth we believe that the differentiation we are creating through our focus on
six sigma quality unparalleled access and distribution the most comprehensive
test menu and innovative test and information technology offerings will provide
us with opportunities to effectively compete beyond pricing as we drive organic
growth additionally we are expanding our sales force providing them better
tools and training and adding innovative new products to sell we are
specifically focused on driving organic growth in highergrowth areas and by
being a leading innovator our principal areas of focus include

          o  physician sub specialists with the aging of the population the
             incidence of cancer and other disease states are increasing
             driving highergrowth in several physician sub specialties
             including urology gastoenterology dermatology and oncology
             historically we have had a smaller market share in these sub
             specialties while we

             provide a strong value proposition in the routine clinical
             testing category we have not been the provider of choice for
             their more complex testing needs we are enhancing our test menu
             and service capabilities to more effectively compete in these
             markets we have added innovative tests such as cellsearchtm
             for women with metastatic breast cancer see our services  new
             test introductions introduced new specialized medical reports
             customized specimen collection kits and added specially trained
             sales representatives

          o  anatomic pathology we estimate that the current united states
             market for anatomic pathology services is approximately 7
             billion per year we estimate that cytology represents
             approximately 13 billion per year of this market and that
             tissue pathology represents approximately 57 billion per year
             of this market with the aging of the population and the
             increased incidence of cancer we believe that the tissue
             pathology business is growing more rapidly than the cytology
             business we are one of the leading providers of anatomic
             pathology services in the united states we have traditionally
             been strongest in cytology and specifically in the analysis of
             pap tests to detect cervical cancer during the last several
             years we have led the industry in converting over 85 of our pap
             testing business to the use of liquidbased technology a more
             effective means of screening for cervical cancer we have also
             enhanced patient service by adding significant choices to our
             test menu including surepathtm liquidbased pap tests and
             human papilloma virus hpv molecular testing as part of a
             primary screening tool we intend to continue to expand our
             anatomic pathology business particularly in tissue pathology
             the higher growth and more profitable segment in conjunction
             with our physician subspecialty focus we have been enhancing
             our anatomic pathology capabilities and service offerings and are
             adding specially trained sales representatives we generated
             approximately 500 million in net revenues from anatomic
             pathology services during 2004

          o  innovation leadership we intend to build upon our reputation as
             a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by
             continuing to introduce new tests technology and services as
             the industry leader with the largest and broadest network and the
             leading provider of esoteric testing we believe that we are the
             best partner for developers of new technologies and tests to
             introduce their products to the marketplace through our
             relationships with members of the academic community
             pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms and emerging medical
             technology companies that develop and commercialize novel
             diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we believe
             that we are one of the leaders in transferring technical
             innovation to the market our innovation activities are focused
             on

               genebased and other esoteric testing capabilities we
                intend to remain a leading innovator in the diagnostic
                testing industry by continuing to introduce new tests
                technology and services we believe that genebased and
                other esoteric tests are the fastest growing segments of
                the diagnostic testing industry we believe that we have
                the largest genebased testing business in the united
                states with approximately 600 million in net revenues
                during 2004 and that this business is growing by over 10
                per year we believe that the unveiling of the human genome
                the discovery of new genes and the linkages of these genes
                with disease will result in more complex and thorough
                predictive and diagnostic testing we believe that we are
                well positioned to benefit from this growth we intend to
                focus on commercializing diagnostic applications of
                discoveries in the areas of functional genomics and
                proteomics

               information technology we continue to invest in the
                development and improvement of information technology
                products for customers and healthcare providers we plan to
                develop differentiated products that will provide more
                convenient ordering and resulting of laboratory tests and
                patientcentric information we believe that these products
                will enhance the value we provide to our customers and
                result in increased customer loyalty our care360r
                physician portaltm or care360 enables doctors to order
                diagnostic tests and review laboratory results online
                electronically prescribe and order medication at the point
                of care view clinical and administrative information from
                many sources file documents received electronically or in
                hard copy into a health record and share confidential
                information with medical colleagues in a manner consistent
                with the health insurance portability and accountability act
                of 1996 or hipaa further care360 is designed to receive
                store and view clinical information from many sources
                including other healthcare providers care360 allows us to
                replace older technology desktop products that we currently
                provide to many physicians and thereby streamline our
                support structure demand has been growing for our
                information technology solutions as physicians have expanded
                their usage of the internet by the end of 2004 we were
                receiving approximately 40 of all test orders and
                delivering about 60 of all test results via the internet

                care360 was developed by medplus inc or medplus our wholly
                owned subsidiary medplus chartmaxxr and care360 patient

               records by bringing together in one patientcentric view
               information from various sources including physicians records
               and laboratory and hospital data we intend to expand the
               services offered through our portal over time through internal
               development and forming strategic relationships

          we expect to continue pursuing growth through acquisitions
historically as the clinical laboratory industry consolidated acquisitions
contributed a significant portion of our growth we believe that organic growth
will become more significant while acquisitions will continue to be an
important contributor to growth

          the clinical laboratory industry remains highly fragmented we expect
to continue to selectively evaluate potential acquisitions of regional clinical
laboratories that can be integrated into our existing laboratories thereby
increasing access for patients and enabling us to reduce costs and improve
efficiencies we will also selectively assess potential acquisition
opportunities that will increase clinical capabilities or geographic presence
both domestically and internationally

          technology is making possible the convergence of various healthcare
disciplines information technology will eventually enable doctors to diagnose
and treat disease by aggregating a patients genetic predisposition diagnostic
test results and diagnostic images into a single patientcentric electronic
medical record having such clinical data in one easily accessed place will
drive better decisionmaking and improved outcomes for patients accordingly
potential acquisitions in adjacent industries such as healthcare information
technology and diagnostic imaging will also be considered our acquisition of
medplus in 2001 was our first acquisition of a healthcare information technology
company

          acquisitions and their integration into our operations could
potentially create issues which could cause an interruption of or
deterioration in our services provided to customers since most of our clinical
laboratory testing is performed under arrangements that are terminable at will
or on short notice any interruption of or deterioration in our services may
also result in a customers decision to stop using us for clinical laboratory
testing these events could have a material adverse impact on our business
however management believes that our rigorous integration planning and
execution and our value proposition based on expanded patient access broad
testing capabilities and most importantly the quality of the services we
provide will mitigate customer attrition

          people are the key to us being able to realize our mission in this
regard an important challenge is to prepare the workforce for the future our
people strategy is built on concepts of stringent employee selection effective
engagement and ongoing development which results in a staff of highly qualified
and motivated employees who are committed to our goals quest diagnostics is
recognized as a best place to work in numerous locales as a consequence of our
workplace initiatives that reflect our belief that people are our most important
asset we take diversity seriously believing that every person who joins our
organization should be comfortable in the workplace and that we should
reasonably reflect the communities that we serve we strive to make all of our
employees effective ambassadors of our company

our services

          our laboratory testing business accounts for approximately 96 of our
net revenues with the balance derived from clinical trials testing and other
services and products laboratory testing includes routine testing and esoteric
testing which generate approximately 82 and 14 respectively of our net
revenues clinical trials testing generates less than 3 of our net revenues we
derive approximately 2 of our net revenues from foreign operations

routine testing

          routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such
as the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly
ordered tests include

         o  blood cholesterol level tests

         o  complete blood cell counts

         o  pap tests

         o  hivrelated tests

         o  urinalyses


                                       4

         o  pregnancy and other prenatal tests and

         o  alcohol and other substanceabuse tests

         we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories
rapid response laboratories and patient service centers we also perform routine
testing at the hospital laboratories we manage major laboratories offer a full
line of routine clinical tests rapid response laboratories are smaller
facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated group of routine tests
for customers that require rapid turnaround times patient service centers are
facilities where specimens are collected and are typically located in or near a
building used by medical professionals

         we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most
routine procedures within 24 hours the majority of test results are delivered
electronically

esoteric testing

         esoteric tests are those tests that require more sophisticated
technology equipment and materials professional handson attention and more
highly skilled professional and technical personnel and may be performed less
frequently than routine tests because it is not costeffective for most
hospital and clinical laboratories to perform lowvolume esoteric tests
inhouse they generally refer many of these tests to an esoteric clinical
testing laboratory that specializes in performing these more complex tests due
to their complexity esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels
than routine tests

         our two esoteric testing laboratories which conduct business as quest
diagnostics nichols institute are among the leading esoteric clinical testing
laboratories in the world in 1998 our esoteric testing laboratory in san juan
capistrano california became the first clinical laboratory in north america to
achieve iso9001 certification our esoteric testing laboratory in chantilly
virginia enables us to provide full esoteric testing services on the east coast
our two esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of esoteric tests that
are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories these esoteric tests
are generally in the following fields

         o  endocrinology and metabolism the study of glands their hormone
            secretions and their effects on body growth and metabolism

         o  genetics the study of chromosomes genes and their protein
            products and effects

         o  hematology the study of blood and bone marrow cells and
            coagulation the process of blood clotting

         o  immunology the study of the immune system including antibodies
            immune system cells and their effects

         o  microbiology and infectious diseases the study of microscopic
            forms of life including bacteria viruses fungi and other
            infectious agents

         o  oncology the study of abnormal cell growth including benign
            tumors and cancer

         o  serology a science dealing with body fluids and their analysis
            including antibodies proteins and other characteristics and

         o  toxicology the study of chemicals and drugs and their effects on
            the bodys metabolism

new test introductions

         we intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the
clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce new diagnostic tests as
the industry leader with the largest and broadest network and the leading
provider of esoteric testing we believe that we are the best partner for
developers of new technology and tests to introduce their products to the
marketplace

         we continued to be a leading innovator in the industry in 2004 through
tests that we developed at quest diagnostics nichols institute the largest
provider of molecular diagnostic testing in the united states as well as
through relationships with technology developers we believe that we are one of
the leaders in transferring technical innovations to the market through our
relationships with members of the academic community and pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms as well as

collaborations with emerging medical technology companies that develop and
commercialize novel diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies

         during 2004 we introduced

         o   the new cellsearchtm circulating tumor cell assay licensed
             from the veridex division of johnson  johnson this assay
             identifies and counts circulating tumor cells in blood samples
             from patients being treated for metastatic breast cancer results
             of a prospective multicenter study published august 19 2004
             in the new england journal of medicine demonstrated that the number
             of circulating tumor cells is predictive of progression free
             survival and overall survival in metastatic breast cancer
             patients we are the only national commercial reference
             laboratory to offer this test veridex received clearance from
             the us food and drug administration in january 2004 for the
             cellsearchtm epithelial cell kit to be used for the enumeration
             of circulating tumor cells of epithelial origin in whole blood

         o   genebased tests to detect hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer
             hnpcc to complement mutation analysis we developed novel
             deletion assays to identify the at least 10 of hnpcc
             patients with gene deletions

         o   next generation testing technology for measurement of steroid
             hormones and other small molecules in blood and body fluids
             tandem mass spectrometry msms is a technology that offers
             greater sensitivity and specificity with shorter testing time
             in the shortterm it has potential application in tests for
             ovarian and testicular hormones adrenal steroids vitamin d
             and catecholamine metabolites

         o   the ta 90 serum assay for malignant melanoma licensed from the
             john wayne cancer institute in los angeles california one of
             the foremost melanoma treatment centers in the world this
             assay is both sensitive and specific for melanoma and measures
             circulating immune complexes to detect recurrence of disease
             following curative surgery

         o   new test panels to identify patients with immunemediated gluten
             sensitivity known as celiac disease in addition we began to
             perform hvala typing for celiac disease risk assessment in our
             nichols institute esoteric testing laboratory in chantilly
             virginia celiac disease is associated with specific hvala types

         o   new tests in hematopathology to help doctors diagnose predict
             response to therapy and monitor patients with chronic
             lymphocytic leukemia the most common leukemia in the western
             world additionally several assays were introduced in 2004 to
             monitor the effectiveness of targeted therapy in patients with
             chronic myeloid leukemia

         we believe that with the unveiling of the human genome new genes and
the linkages of genes with disease will continue to be discovered at an
accelerating pace and will result in ever more complex and thorough predictive
and diagnostic testing we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from
these advances

clinical trials testing

         we believe that we are the worlds second largest provider of clinical
laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new
drugs clinical research trials are required by the food and drug
administration or fda and other international regulatory authorities to assess
the safety and efficacy of new drugs we have clinical trials testing centers in
the united states and in the united kingdom we also provide clinical trials
testing in australia singapore and south africa through arrangements with
third parties clinical trials involving new drugs are increasingly being
performed both inside and outside the united states approximately 55 of our
net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2004 represented testing for
glaxosmithkline plc or gsk we currently have a longterm contractual
relationship with gsk under which we are the primary provider of testing to
support gsks clinical trials testing requirements worldwide

other services and products

         we manufacture and market diagnostic test kits and systems primarily
for esoteric testing through our nichols institute diagnostics subsidiary these
are sold principally to hospitals clinical laboratories and dialysis centers
both domestically and internationally our medplus subsidiary is a developer and
integrator of clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare
organizations physicians and clinicians primarily through its chartmaxxr
electronic medical record system for hospitals and care360 care360 was
developed by medplus and enables physicians to order

medical colleagues in a manner that is consistent with hipaa privacy and
security requirements

payers and customers

         we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers
we consider a payer as the party that pays for the test and a customer as
the party who refers the test to us depending on the billing arrangement and
applicable law the payer may be 1 the physician or other party such as a
hospital another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 2
the patient or 3 a third party who pays the bill for the patient such as an
insurance company medicare or medicaid some states including new york new
jersey and rhode island prohibit us from billing physician clients during
2004 only two customers accounted for more than 5 of our net revenues and no
single customer accounted for more than 6 of our net revenues we believe that
the loss of any one of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

         the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the
percentage of our total volume of requisitions and total clinical laboratory net
revenues during 2004 applicable to each payer group



                                                                              net revenues

physicians

         physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary referral
source of our clinical laboratory testing volume testing referred by physicians
is typically billed to healthcare insurers government programs such as medicare
and medicaid patients and physicians we typically bill physician accounts on a
feeforservice basis fees billed to physicians are based on the laboratorys
client fee schedule and are typically negotiated fees billed to patients and
insurance companies are based on the laboratorys patient fee schedule subject
to any limitations on fees negotiated with the insurance companies or with
physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are
based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities

healthcare insurers

         healthcare insurers including managed care organizations and other
healthcare insurance providers which typically directly or indirectly contract
with a number of clinical laboratories on behalf of their members represent
approximately onehalf of our total testing volumes and onehalf of our net
revenues larger healthcare insurers typically prefer to use large commercial
clinical laboratories because they can provide services to their members on a
national or regional basis in addition larger laboratories are better able to
achieve the lowcost structures necessary to profitably service the members of
large healthcare plans and can provide test utilization data across various
products in a consistent format healthcare insurers frequently require test
utilization data in order to meet the reporting requirements of the national
committee for quality assurance or ncqa to implement disease management
programs and for other health plan operation purposes in certain markets such
as california healthcare insurers delegate their covered members to independent
physician associations or ipas which in turn contract with laboratories for
clinical laboratory services on behalf of their members

         in recent years there has been a shift in the way major healthcare
insurers reimburse clinical laboratories healthcare insurers have begun to
offer more freedom of choice to their members including greater freedom to
determine which laboratory to use and which tests to order accordingly most of
our agreements with major healthcare insurers are nonexclusive arrangements as
a result under these nonexclusive arrangements physicians and patients have
more freedom of

choice in selecting laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on
the basis of service and quality rather than price alone also healthcare
insurers are increasingly offering programs such as preferred provider
organizations or ppos and consumer driven plans that offer a greater choice of
healthcare providers pricing for these programs is typically negotiated on a
feeforservice basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition
than under capitation arrangements if consumer driven plans and ppo plans
increase in popularity it will be increasingly important for healthcare
providers to differentiate themselves based on quality service and convenience
to avoid competing on price alone under a capitation arrangement the company
and healthcare insurers agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for
each member of the healthcare insurers plan regardless of the number or cost
of services provided by the company despite these trends healthcare insurers
continue to aggressively seek cost reductions in order to keep premiums to their
customers competitive if the company is unable to agree on pricing with a
healthcare insurer we could become a nonparticipating provider which may
require us to bill the patient or in certain cases the physician rather than
the healthcare insurer this nonparticipating status could lead to loss of
business since typically in these instances patients have a higher coinsurance
responsibility and physicians may not refer testing to a nonparticipating
provider in order to avoid the additional expense for the patient

         the trend of consolidation among healthcare insurers has continued
resulting in fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power in
negotiating fee arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical
laboratories these healthcare insurers as well as ipas demand that clinical
laboratory service providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or
a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to
their members through capitated payment arrangements some services such as
various esoteric tests new technologies and anatomic pathology services may be
carved out from a capitated rate and if carved out are charged on a
feeforservice basis we work closely with healthcare insurers as they evaluate
new tests however as innovation in the testing area increases there is no
guarantee that healthcare insurers will agree to offer the technology as a
covered service carve out these services or reimburse them at rates that
reflect the true cost or value associated with such services

         historically most medicare beneficiaries were covered under the
traditional medicare program but the federal government has over the last
several years affected various proposals in an effort to increase enrollment of
medicare beneficiaries in the private managed care system with the enactment of
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or
mma which renamed the private medicare program medicare advantage and created
an additional product that allows for regional preferred provider organization
it is possible that the company may begin to experience a shift of traditional
medicare beneficiaries to private medicare advantage programs

         a significant portion of the laboratory costs incurred by healthcare
insurers is for payments made to noncontracted providers primarily hospitals
at rates exceeding those of contracted providers we offer questnettm a
service whereby we develop and administer customized networks of clinical
laboratory providers for healthcare insurers through questnettm physicians
and members are provided multiple choices for clinical laboratory testing while
healthcare insurers realize cost reductions from reducing testing performed by
noncontracted providers

hospitals

         hospitals generally maintain an onsite laboratory to perform testing
on patients and refer less frequently needed and highly specialized procedures
to outside laboratories which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated
feeforservice basis fee schedules for hospital reference testing are
typically negotiated on behalf of the hospitals by group purchasing
organizations we believe that most hospital laboratories perform approximately
90 to 95 of their patients clinical laboratory tests we provide services to
hospitals throughout the united states that vary from esoteric testing to
helping manage their laboratories we believe that we are the industrys market
leader in servicing hospitals our hospital customers account for approximately
13 of our net revenues the majority of which represents services billed to the
hospitals for certain testing that the hospitals do not perform internally
hospitals continue to look for ways to fully utilize their existing laboratory
capacity through test internalization as well as competing with commercial
laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most physicians have
admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their
medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships with community
physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the
hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician practices
generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospitals affiliated
laboratory

         we have dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique
needs of hospital customers we believe that the combination of fullservice
bicoastal esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals
for consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality
and dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be a partner
of choice for hospital customers

         we have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated healthcare
delivery networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture
arrangements which provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for
unaffiliated physicians and other healthcare providers in their geographic
areas serve as our principal laboratory facilities in their service areas
typically we have either a majority ownership interest in or daytoday
management responsibilities for our hospital joint venture relationships we
also manage the laboratories at a number of other hospitals

employers governmental institutions and other clinical laboratories

         we provide testing services to federal state and local governmental
agencies and to large employers we believe that we are the leading provider of
clinical laboratory testing to employers for drugs of abuse we also provide
wellness testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in
improving their health testing services for employers account for approximately
3 of our net revenues the volume of testing services for employers which
generally have relatively low profit margins has increased moderately in 2004
driven by an increase in hiring we also perform esoteric testing services for
other commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a full range of testing
capabilities all of these customers are charged on a feeforservice basis

consumers

         consumers are becoming increasingly interested in managing their own
health and health records currently almost all the testing we perform is
ordered directly by physicians who then receive the test results certain states
limit the ability of consumers to order tests themselves or to obtain test
results directly however over time we believe that consumers will
increasingly want to order clinical laboratory tests themselves we offer a
focused menu of clinical laboratory testing directly to consumers in certain
states that permit us to do so consumers pay for and receive the test results
directly in each case a physician reviews the order and result we believe
this market will continue to grow over time

sales and marketing

         we market to and service our customers through our direct sales force
healthcare insurers sales force customer service representatives and couriers

         we focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable
accounts we have an active customer management process to evaluate the growth
potential and profitability of all accounts where appropriate we manage
service levels to ensure our growth and profitability goals are achieved

         our sales force is organized by customer type with the majority of
representatives focused on marketing laboratory services to physicians
including specialty physicians such as oncologists urologists and
gastroenterologists additionally we have a healthcare insurer sales
organization that focuses on regional and national insurance and healthcare
organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on
meeting the unique needs of hospitals and leverages the specialized capabilities
of our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratories supporting our hospital
and physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are
specially trained and focused on educating our clients on new and more complex
tests a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling
substanceofabuse testing to employers

         customer service representatives perform a number of services for
patients and customers they monitor services answer questions and help resolve
problems our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily

         our corporate marketing function is organized by customer type and is
responsible for developing and executing marketing strategies new product
launches and promotional and advertising support the marketing function is
also responsible for customer satisfaction surveys market research tradeshow
administration database marketing tools and market analysis

information systems

         information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of
our business including laboratory testing billing customer service
logistics and management of medical data our success depends in part on the
continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it
systems computer systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources
including telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and
natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our
servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer
viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures that
we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it
systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to
process test orders deliver test

results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our
reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues

         historically when we acquired many of our laboratory facilities our
regional laboratories were operated as local decentralized units and we did
not standardize their billing laboratory and some of their other information
systems this resulted in many different information systems for billing test
results reporting and other transactions

         during 2002 we began implementation of a standard laboratory
information system and a standard billing system we expect the deployment of
the standardized systems will take several more years to complete and will
result in fewer systems than we have today we expect the integration of these
systems will improve operating efficiency and provide management with more
timely and comprehensive information with which to make management decisions
however failure to properly implement this standardization process could
materially adversely impact us during system conversions of this type workflow
may be reengineered to take advantage of enhanced system capabilities and may
cause temporary disruptions in service in addition the implementation process
including the transfer of databases and master files to new data centers
presents significant conversion risks that need to be managed carefully

billing

         billing for laboratory services is complicated depending on the
billing arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as
patients insurance companies medicare medicaid doctors and employer groups
all of which have different requirements additionally other factors that
complicate billing include

         o   differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates
             of the payers

         o   disparity in coverage and information requirements among various
             payers

         o   incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering
             physicians

         o   auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as
             well as internal compliance policies and procedures and

         o   disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for
             payment

         we incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation
in medicare and medicaid programs as billing and reimbursement for clinical
laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal and state
regulations these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity
added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and
customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other
factors medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices compliance
with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies
and procedures adds further complexity and costs to the billing process
changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our
clients the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms formerly the
health care financing administration establishes procedures and continuously
evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process

         we believe that most of our bad debt expense which was 44 of our net
revenues in 2004 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing
information on requisitions received from healthcare providers rather than
credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report
test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or
missing we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider to obtain
any missing information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or
incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing
process creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the
aging of accounts receivable when all issues relating to the missing or
incorrect information are not resolved in a timely manner the related
receivables are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts

         we have significantly reduced bad debt expense as a percentage of net
revenues from about 7 during 1996 to 44 during 2004 by using six sigma and
implementing our standardization initiatives and billing best practices we
believe that in the longer term with a continuing focus on process discipline
and the increased use of electronic ordering by our customers bad debt as a
percentage of net revenues can be reduced to 4 or less see regulation of
reimbursement for clinical laboratory services

competition

         while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical
laboratory testing business in recent years our industry remains fragmented and
highly competitive we compete with three types of laboratory providers
hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and
physicianoffice laboratories we are the leading clinical laboratory provider
in the united states with net revenues of 51 billion during 2004 and
facilities in substantially all of the countrys major metropolitan areas our
largest competitor is laboratory corporation of america holdings inc in
addition we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical
laboratories as well as laboratories owned by physicians and hospitals see
payers and customers

         we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when
selecting a laboratory including

         o service capability and quality

         o accuracy timeliness and consistency in reporting test results

         o number and type of tests performed by the laboratory

         o number convenience and geographic coverage of patient service
           centers

         o reputation in the medical community and

         o pricing

         we believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas

         we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to
increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to
their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should
enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers
and members of large healthcare plans in addition we believe that
consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing business will continue
however a majority of the clinical laboratory testing is likely to continue to
be performed by hospitals which generally have affiliations with community
physicians that refer testing to us see payers and customers  hospitals as
a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated
laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as
other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to
hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could negatively impact
our net revenues

         the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and
new product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of
more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical
laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians
in their offices 2 esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their
own laboratories and 3 testing that can be performed by patients in their
homes development of such technology and its use by our customers and patients
would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively
impact our net revenues see regulation of clinical laboratory operations

quality assurance

         our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection
storage and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and
accuracy of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus
on proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and
personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we
continue to implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help
achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the
healthcare services industry our nichols institute facility in san juan
capistrano was the first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve
iso9001 certification two of our clinical trials laboratories our diagnostic
kits facility and one of our routine laboratories have also achieved iso9001
certification these certifications are international standards for quality
management systems

         internal proficiency testing quality control and audits quality
control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient
specimens the results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to
identify trends biases or imprecision in the analytical processes we also
perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive quality assurance
program

         external proficiency testing and accreditation all of our laboratories
participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include
proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american
pathologists or cap as well as some state agencies

         cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of board certified
pathologists cap is approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to
determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory
improvement amendments of 1988 or clia cap offers an accreditation program to
which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional
laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections
and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program
recently the cap has required all cap accredited laboratories to post whistle
blower hotline posters to escalate quality and laboratory safety issues to cap
that have not been resolved through other internal reporting

regulation of clinical laboratory operations

         the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and
state regulation including inspections and audits by governmental agencies
governmental authorities may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other
actions to enforce laws and regulations including revoking a clinical
laboratorys federal certification to operate a clinical laboratory operation
changes in regulation may increase the costs of performing clinical laboratory
tests increase the administrative requirements of claims or decrease the amount
of reimbursement

         clia and state regulation all of our laboratories and where
applicable patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the
appropriate federal and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical
laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply
with various operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure
that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and
timely clia does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal
law for example state laws may require additional personnel qualifications
quality control record maintenance andor proficiency testing the cost of
compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate
clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory
equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing
pointofcare laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling to both
physicians and patients test kits approved by the fda for home use diagnostic
tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to be
waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories
with minimal regulatory oversight under clia as well as by patients in their
homes

detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to
perform drug testing on these employees all laboratories that perform such
testing must be certified as meeting samhsa standards all of our laboratories
that perform such testing are certified as meeting samhsa standards

dea regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse
testing laboratories that use controlled substances must be licensed by the

dea

         medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical
laboratories are also subject to federal state and local regulations relating
to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and
radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of such
waste

         fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits
reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical
laboratories in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over
laboratorydeveloped tests but has exercised enforcement discretion in not
regulating most laboratorydeveloped tests performed by high complexity
cliacertified laboratories in december 2000 the department of health and
human services or hhs secretarys advisory committee on genetic testing
recommended that the fda be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing
in late 2002 a new hhs secretarys advisory committee on genetics health and
society was appointed to replace the prior advisory committee but it has not
yet made any final recommendations in the meantime the fda is considering
revising its regulations on analyte specific reagents which are used in
laboratorydeveloped tests including laboratorydeveloped genetic testing
representatives of clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics and the
american clinical laboratory association our industry trade association have
communicated industry concerns to representatives of the fda regarding potential
fda regulation of genetic testing in general and issues with regard to the
impact of potential increased oversight over analyte specific reagents we
expect those discussions to continue increased fda regulation of the reagents
used in laboratorydeveloped testing could lead to increased costs and delays in
introducing new tests including genetic tests

         occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health
administration or osha has established extensive requirements relating
specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers this includes
requirements to develop and implement multifaceted programs to protect workers
from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c
including preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick
injuries

         specimen transportation transportation of most clinical laboratory
specimens and some laboratory supplies are considered hazardous materials
subject to regulation by the department of transportation the public health
service the united states postal service and the international air transport
association iata

         corporate practice of medicine many states including some in which
our principal laboratories are located prohibit corporations from engaging in
the practice of medicine the corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been
interpreted in certain states to prohibit corporations from employing licensed
healthcare professionals to provide services on the corporations behalf the
scope of the doctrine and how it applies varies from state to state in
certain states these restrictions affect our ability to directly provide
anatomic pathology services andor to provide clinical laboratory services
directly to consumers

healthcare information technology

         clinical laboratories use information technology to obtain laboratory
orders and to communicate results and provide other reporting innovations in
healthcare information technology hcit have the potential to improve patient
care promote efficiency and reduce expense both at the federal and state
levels there are public and private efforts to bring together healthcare
providers information technology vendors and other stakeholders to coordinate
federal healthcare information systems and develop a national healthcare
network including developing standards for electronic interoperability
standards for the exchange and use of electronic healthcare data

         both the company and medplus its hcit subsidiary could be impacted by
any national healthcare information network and the adoption of standards for
hcit interoperability because of substantial existing investments in software
and hardware and the potential for having to make substantial future investments
to comply with new or different standards the company and acla its trade
association are monitoring and providing relevant information to policy makers
to ensure that issues important to medical laboratories are reflected in any
interoperability standards and that the voice of the industry and the company
are heard

privacy and security of health information standard transactions

         pursuant to hipaa the secretary of hhs has issued final regulations
designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by
facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and
administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the
information exchanged three principal regulations have been issued in final
form privacy regulations security regulations and standards for electronic
transactions

         the hipaa privacy regulations which fully came into effect in april
2003 establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and
disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare
providers and healthcare clearinghouses the regulations establish a complex
regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including

         o  the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected
            health information are permitted or required without a specific
            authorization by the patient including but not limited to treatment
            purposes activities to obtain payment for our services and our
            healthcare operations activities

         o  a patients rights to access amend and receive an accounting of
            certain disclosures of protected health information

         o  the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health
            information and

         o  administrative technical and physical safeguards required of
            entities that use or receive protected health information

           we have implemented the hipaa privacy regulations as required by
law the hipaa privacy regulations establish a floor and do not supersede
state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with
both federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws in addition for
healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries we need to
comply with the laws of other countries the federal privacy regulations
restrict our ability to use or


                                       13

disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient authorization
for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined
by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other
permitted purposes outlined in the final privacy regulations the privacy
regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use
or disclosure of protected health information including potential civil and
criminal fines and penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not
expressly provide for a private right of damages we also could incur damages
under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of
confidential health information or other private personal information

         the final hipaa security regulations which establish requirements for
safeguarding electronic patient information were published on february 20 2003
and became effective on april 21 2003 although healthcare providers have until
april 20 2005 to comply we have conducted analyses and have been implementing
policies and standards to implement security measures to reasonably and
appropriately comply with the regulations requirements by the compliance
deadline of april 20 2005

         the final hipaa regulations for electronic transactions which we refer
to as the transaction standards establish uniform standards for electronic
transactions and code sets including the electronic transactions and code sets
used for claims remittance advices enrollment and eligibility hhs issued
guidance on july 24 2003 stating that it would not penalize a covered entity
for postimplementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the
transactions standards if the covered entity could demonstrate its good faith
efforts to comply with the standards

         many of our payers were not ready to implement the transaction
standards by the october 2003 compliance deadline or were not ready to test or
troubleshoot claims submissions since that time significant progress has been
made in implementing the transaction standards with our payers as of december
31 2004 greater than 95 of our electronic feeforservice claim transactions
are submitted in the new standard format and greater than 85 of our electronic
feeforservice remittance transactions are received in the new standard format
we are working in good faith with payers that have not converted to the new
standards to reach agreement on each payers data requirements and to test
claims submissions

         the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences
in interpretation by payers for instance some payers may interpret the
standards to require us to provide certain types of information including
demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians we are working
closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissions
and with our trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and
problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting
organizations

regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services

         overview the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes
in reimbursement practices during the past several years government payers
such as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and
medicaid which principally serves indigent patients as well as private payers
and large employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control
the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical
laboratory services if we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments
we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor
introducing new procedures it could have a material adverse impact on our net
revenues and profitability

          principally as a result of government reimbursement reductions and
measures adopted by cms to reduce utilization described below the percentage of
our net revenues derived from medicare and medicaid programs is lower that it
was prior to these measures being implemented the cost to comply with medicare
administrative requirements is disproportionately higher than our cost to bill
other payers making the medicare business generally less profitable medicaid
also pays substantially less on an average perrequisition basis than other
third party payers however we believe that our other business may depend in
part on continued participation in the medicare and medicaid programs because
certain customers may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of
their clinical laboratory testing services regardless of whether reimbursements
are ultimately made by themselves medicare medicaid or other payers

         billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to
significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations
of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of
federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in
medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines
and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and
authorizations necessary to operate some or all of a clinical laboratorys
business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more
than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case
of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three
times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the
federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per
violation plus up to three times the amount claimed

         reduced reimbursements in 1984 congress established a medicare fee
schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for
patients covered under part b of the medicare program congress then imposed a
national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local
medicare fee schedules since then congress has periodically reduced the
national ceilings the medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced
in 1996 to 76 of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in
1998 to 74 of the 1984 national median the national ceiling applies to tests
for which limitation amounts were established before january 1 2001 for more
recent tests tests for which a limitation amount is first established on or
after january 1 2001 the limitation amount is set at 100 of the median of
all the local fee schedules established for that test in accordance with the
social security act the mma eliminated for five years beginning january 1
2004 the provision for annual increases to the medicare national fee schedule
based on the consumer price index including the adjustment which would have
been 26 that had been scheduled for january 1 2004 thus by law an
adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical laboratory services based
on the consumer price index cannot occur before january 1 2009 however the
mma added coverage for certain cardiovascular screening tests and diabetes
screening tests subject to certain frequency limitations the mma evaluates new
diagnostic tests for coverage as they are introduced in addition the 2005
physician fee schedule rule proposes to lower medicares payment rates for flow
cytometry services in 2005 quest diagnostics believes that cms failed to
properly value these services and is commenting on this proposed change through
acla pathology services are reimbursed by medicare based on a resourcebased
relative value scale or rbrvs that is periodically updated by cms
approximately 1 of our net revenues are derived from pathology services
reimbursed by medicare based on rbrvs

         with regard to the rest of our laboratory services performed on behalf
of medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must
accept the carriers fee schedule amount as payment in full in addition state
medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay
significantly less than medicare major clinical laboratories including quest
diagnostics typically use two fee schedules for tests billed on a
feeforservice basis

         o  client fees charged to physicians hospitals and institutions for
            which a clinical laboratory performs testing services on a wholesale
            basis and which are billed on a monthly basis these fees are
            generally subject to negotiation or discount

         o  patient fees charged to individual patients and thirdparty
            payers like medicare and medicaid these fees generally require
            separate bills for each requisition

         the fee schedule amounts established by medicare are typically
substantially lower than patient fees otherwise charged by us but are sometimes
higher than our fees actually charged to certain other clients during 1992 the
office of the inspector general or oig of the hhs issued final regulations
that prohibited charging medicare fees substantially in excess of a providers
usual charges the laboratory industry believes that the term usual charges
specifically applies to amounts charged to similarlysituated thirdparty payers
and to patients and that client fees should not be included in usual charges
the oig however declined to provide any guidance concerning interpretation of
these rules including whether or not discounts to nongovernmental clients and
payers or the dualfee structure might be inconsistent with these rules

         a proposed rule released in september 1997 would have authorized the
oig to exclude providers from participation in the medicare program including
clinical laboratories that charge medicare and other programs fees that are
substantially in excess of    usual charges    to any of their
customers clients or patients this proposal was withdrawn by the oig in 1998
in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion which indicated that a
clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the usual
charges regulation if the charge to medicare substantially exceeds the amount
the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept
from nonfederal payers the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that
the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to
private pay customers

         in september 2003 the oig published a notice of proposed rulemaking
that would amend the oigs exclusion regulations addressing excessive claims
under the proposed exclusion rule the oig would have the authority to exclude a
provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are
substantially in excess of the providers usual charges the proposal would
define usual charges as the average payment from nongovernment entities on a
test by test basis excluding capitated payments and would define
substantially in excess to be an amount that is more than 20 greater than the
usual charge we believe that the rule is unnecessary for the clinical
laboratory industry because congress has already established fee schedules for
the services that the rule proposes to regulate we also believe that the rule
is unworkable and overly burdensome through our industry trade association we
filed comments opposing the proposed rule and we are working with our trade
association and a coalition of other healthcare providers who also oppose this
proposed regulation as drafted if this regulation is adopted as proposed it
could potentially reduce the amounts we bill and collect from medicare and other
federal payers affect the fees we charge to other payers or subject the
company to penalties for noncompliance and could also be costly for us to
administer

         the 1997 balanced budget act permits cms to adjust statutorily
prescribed fees for some medical services including clinical laboratory
services if the fees are grossly excessive in december 2002 cms issued an
interim final rule setting forth a process and factors for establishing a
realistic and equitable payment amount for all medicare part b services
except physician services and services paid under a prospective payment system
when the existing payment amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable
payment amounts may be considered unreasonable because they are either grossly
excessive or deficient cms is expected to issue instructions to carriers on
implementation of the inherent reasonableness authority upon receipt of those
instructions the carriers can then implement the final rule we cannot provide
any assurances to investors that fees payable by medicare could not be reduced
as a result of the application of this rule or that the government might not
assert claims for reimbursement by purporting to retroactively apply this rule
or the oig interpretation concerning usual charges

         currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a
copayment for clinical laboratory testing when copayments were last in effect
before adoption of the clinical laboratory services fee schedules in 1984
clinical laboratories received from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare
allowed amount and were required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid
balance of the medicare allowed amount if reenacted a copayment requirement
could adversely affect the revenues of the clinical laboratory industry
including us by exposing the testing laboratory to the credit of individuals
and by increasing the number of bills in addition a laboratory could be
subject to potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate procedures to bill
and collect the copayments are not established and followed the medicare
reform bill approved by the united state senate in june 2003 included a
copayment provision under which clinical laboratories would receive from
medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed amount for clinical
laboratory tests and would be required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the
20 balance of the medicare allowed amount the copayment provision was dropped
from the bill as passed known as the medicare prescription drug improvement
and modernization act of 2003 we cannot provide any assurances to investors
that congress would not seek to reimpose a copayment requirement payable by
medicare beneficiaries for clinical laboratory services certain medicaid
programs already require medicaid recipients to pay copayment amounts for
clinical laboratory testing

         reduced utilization of clinical laboratory testing in recent years
cms has taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory
testing since 1995 medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do
not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician
has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of
the test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when
they order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients however cms has
not prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide diagnostic
information to laboratories moreover regulations adopted in accordance with
hipaa require submission of diagnosis codes as part of the standard claims
transaction

         we are generally permitted to bill patients directly for some
statutorily excluded clinical laboratory services if a patient signs an advance
beneficiary notice or abn we are also generally permitted to bill patients for
clinical laboratory tests that medicare does not cover due to medical
necessity limitations these tests include limited coverage tests for which the
ordering physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain
tests ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by medicare an
abn is a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patients informed
decision to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which are
likely to be denied and not reimbursed by medicare because they are deemed to be
not medically necessary we do not have any direct contact with most of these
patients and in such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the
physician or the physicians office staff if the abn is not timely provided to
the beneficiary or is not completed properly we may end up performing tests
that we cannot subsequently bill to the patient if they are not reimbursable by
medicare due to coverage limitations

         inconsistent practices currently many different local carriers
administer medicare they have inconsistent policies on matters such as 1
test coverage 2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims
documentation and 5 fee schedules subject to the national fee schedule
limitations inconsistent carrier rules and policies have increased the
complexity of the billing process for clinical laboratories as part of the 1997
balanced budget act hhs was required to adopt uniform policies on the above
matters by january 1 1999 and to replace the current local carriers with no
more than five regional carriers although hhs has finalized a number of uniform
test coveragediagnosis coding policies it has not taken any final action to
replace the local carriers with five regional carriers

         carrier jurisdiction changes for labtolab referrals on october 31
2003 cms announced its intention to change the manner in which medicare
contractors currently process claims for labtolab referrals of clinical
laboratory tests while laboratories are under certain criteria permitted to
directly bill medicare for clinical laboratory tests they refer to other
laboratories they must be reimbursed at the correct fee schedule amount based
on the medicare fee schedule in effect in the medicare carrier region in which
the test was actually performed historically laboratories needed to enroll
with and file claims to multiple carriers in order to bill for such outofarea
test referrals to ensure receipt of the appropriate payment amount this has
proven to be an administratively difficult process with many obstacles to
obtaining accurate claims payment


                                       16

including applying the correct fee schedule on july 1 2004 cms implemented a
change that mandated that the laboratorys home carrier maintain and apply the
clinical laboratory fee schedule applicable to the carrier region where the test
was performed this streamlined process allows a laboratory to file all of its
clinical laboratory claims to its home carrier

         cms also has announced a parallel change with regard to purchased
diagnostic interpretations pathology services a previously announced change
in medicare carrier jurisdiction rules required laboratories to bill the carrier
where a purchased diagnostic interpretation service was performed this would
have required carriers to issue medicare provider numbers to the billing
laboratory in october 2004 cms posted a change notice permitting
laboratories to temporarily bill their local carriers for purchased diagnostic
tests or interpretations regardless of the location where the service was
furnished the final change notice was issued on october 29 2004 effective
april 1 2005 the final notice requires carriers to implement a new edit to
check for duplicate claims for referred clinical diagnostic laboratory and
purchased diagnostic services submitted by physicianssuppliers to more than one
carrier

         competitive bidding the mma requires cms to conduct a demonstration
project on the application of competitive acquisition to clinical laboratory
tests cms awarded the clinical laboratory competitive bidding demonstration
design and implementation contract to rti international research triangle park
north carolina and its subcontractor palmetto gba palmetto is a part b
carrier and previously conducted for cms a competitive bidding demonstration for
durable medical equipment dme a timeline in the bid package for the design
and implementation phase of the competitive bidding demonstration calls for
distribution of bid packages in december 2005 the clinical laboratory
competitive bidding demonstration project is expected to take place in two
separate locations but other key details of the demonstration have not been
determined quest diagnostics and acla its trade association will monitor the
design and implementation phase carefully because of industry concerns that the
competitive bidding demonstrations will not take into account all of the factors
involved in the timely delivery of high quality clinical laboratory testing to a
broad range of clients in diverse geographic settings

         early in 2004 the state of florida issued but later withdrew a request
for proposals for competitive bidding of clinical laboratory testing for its
medicaid program however in december 2004 florida issued an invitation to
negotiate itn seeking competitive bids for the provision of clinical
laboratory tests on a capitatedbasis for some medicaid recipients and on a
reduced feeforservice basis for other medicaid recipients the itn
contemplates that the florida medicaid agency ahca will negotiate with the
three highestscoring bidders for an exclusive statewide contract of at least
three years plus a potential renewal period acla the trade association for
clinical laboratories filed two petitions with ahca challenging the itn on
public policy and legal grounds in addition quest diagnostics and another
large laboratory independently filed bid protests with ahca on february 18
2005 ahca announced without further explanation that it was withdrawing the
itn if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or national basis for
clinical laboratory testing it could materially adversely affect the clinical
laboratory industry and us

         future legislation future changes in federal state and local
regulations or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting
governmental reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely
affect us we cannot predict however whether and what type of legislative
proposals will be enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by
regulatory authorities

         fraud and abuse regulations medicare and medicaid antikickback laws
prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other benefits
to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or other federal
programs as noted above the penalties for violation of these laws may include
criminal and civil fines and penalties andor suspension or exclusion from
participation in federal programs many of the antifraud statutes and
regulations including those relating to joint ventures and alliances are vague
or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot predict if
some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted contrary to our practices

         in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion concluding that
the industry practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if
the discounted price is below a laboratorys overall cost including overhead
and below the amounts reimbursed by medicare advisory opinions are not binding
but may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement
actions the oigs opinion if enforced could result in fines and possible
exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below
the rates reimbursed by medicare the oig subsequently issued a letter
clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se violation
of the federal antikickback statute but may merit further investigation
depending on the facts and circumstances presented

         in addition since 1992 a federal antiselfreferral law commonly
known as the stark law prohibits with certain exceptions medicare payments
for laboratory tests referred by physicians who have personally or through a
family member an investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with
the testing laboratory since january 1995 these restrictions


                                       17

have also applied to medicaidcovered services many states have similar
antiselfreferral and other laws that are not limited to medicare and
medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation
arrangements with physicians we cannot predict if some of the state laws will
be interpreted contrary to our practices

         in april 2003 the oig issued a special advisory bulletin addressing
what it described as questionable contractual arrangements in contractual
joint ventures the oig bulletin focused on arrangements where a healthcare
provider or owner expands into a related healthcare business by contracting
with a healthcare provider or manager that already is engaged in that line of
business for the manager to provide related healthcare items or services to the
patients of the owner in return for a share of the profits of the new line of
business while we believe that the bulletin is directed at sham arrangements
intended to induce referrals we cannot predict whether the oig might choose to
investigate all contractual joint ventures including our joint ventures with
various hospitals or hospital systems

government investigations and related claims

         we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and
local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with
government settlements and public announcements by various government officials
the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud
in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give
federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and
remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse many of the regulations
applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests
and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or
indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted
or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that
could require us to make changes in our operations including our billing
practices if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could
suffer civil and criminal damages including the loss of licenses or our ability
to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare
programs in addition certain federal and state statues including the qui tam
provisions of the federal false claim act allow private individuals to bring
lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers
alleging inappropriate billing practices

         during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled significant
government claims that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing
practices that both companies believed to be lawful the federal or state
governments may bring additional claims based on new theories as to our
practices that we believe to be in compliance with law the federal government
has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of
potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed and the
government has the remedy of excluding a noncompliant provider from
participation in the medicare and medicaid programs which represented
approximately 17 of our net revenues during 2004

         there are certain pending lawsuits regarding our billing practices
filed under the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims statute and other
federal and state statutes some of the cases involve claims that are
substantial in amount we have also received subpoenas from the united states
attorneys office for the eastern district of new york requiring the production
of various business records including documents related to parathyroid hormone
testing and parathyroid hormone test kits manufactured by our subsidiary nichols
institute diagnostics we are cooperating with the governments investigation

         although management believes that established reserves for claims are
sufficient including qui tam cases of which management is aware it is
possible that additional information may become available that may cause the
final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves by an amount
which could be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the
period in which such claims are settled we do not believe that these issues
will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition however
we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former
employees or other whistle blowers as to which we have not been provided with
a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any
potential liability

         as an integral part of our compliance program discussed below we
investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal healthcare
reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or
medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a
result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported
overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken
corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each
instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient

compliance program

         compliance with all government rules and regulations has become a
significant concern throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of
evolving interpretations of regulations and the national debate over healthcare
we established a compliance program early in 1993

         we emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure
the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and
company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures personnel
and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations the
quality safety  compliance committee of the board of directors requires
periodic reporting of compliance operations from management

         we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and
regulations applicable to our operations many of these statutes and regulations
have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot assure investors that
applicable statutes or regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a
prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely
affect us potential sanctions for violation of these statutes include
significant damages penalties and fines exclusion from participation in
governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates
and authorization necessary to operate some or all of our business which could
have a material adverse effect on our business

intellectual property rights

         other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain
patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our
ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a
result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be
found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to
do one or more of the following

         o  cease developing performing or selling products or services that
            incorporate the challenged intellectual property

         o  obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed
            intellectual property right

         o  redesign or reengineer our tests

         o  change our business processes or

         o  pay substantial damages court costs and attorneys fees including
            potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be
            willful

         patents generally are not issued until several years after an
application is filed the possibility that before a patent is issued to a third
party we may be performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is
not a defense to an infringement claim thus even tests that we develop could
become the subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent
covering those tests

         infringement and other intellectual property claims regardless of
their merit can be expensive and timeconsuming to litigate in addition any
requirement to reengineer our tests or change our business processes could
substantially increase our costs force us to interrupt product sales or delay
new test releases in the past we have settled several disputes regarding our
alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties we are
currently involved in settling several additional disputes we do not believe
that resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations cash flows or financial condition however infringement
claims could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or
processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as
genebased testing and other specialty testing

insurance

         as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services
may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims
these suits could involve claims for substantial damages any professional
liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and
reputation we maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that
could result from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing
services including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our
insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we
are essentially selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the
basis for claims reserves considers actuarially determined losses based upon our
historical and projected loss experience management believes that present
insurance coverage and reserves are


                                       19




page


sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures although management cannot
predict the outcome of any claims made against the company management does not
anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings or claims will have
a material adverse effect on our financial position but may be material to our
results of operations and cash flows in the period in which such claims are
resolved similarly although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate
insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs we cannot assure you that
we will be able to do so

employees

         at december 31 2004 we employed approximately 38600 people this
total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority
interest we have no collective bargaining agreements with any unions covering
any employees in the united states and we believe that our overall relations
with our employees are good

laboratories tests that are not routine and that require more sophisticated
equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric tests esoteric
tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that
specialize in performing those tests

    we believe that the united states diagnostic testing industry had
over 37 billion in annual revenues in 2003 most laboratory tests are
performed by one of three types of laboratories commercial clinical
laboratories hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice
laboratories in 2003 we believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories
performed over onehalf of the clinical laboratory tests in the united states
commercial clinical laboratories performed approximately onethird of those
tests and physicianoffice laboratories performed the balance

    the underlying fundamentals of the diagnostic testing industry have improved
since the early to mid1990s which was a period of declining reimbursement and
reduced test utilization during the early 1990s the

industry was negatively impacted by changes in government regulation and
investigations into various billing practices in addition the rapid growth of
managed care as a result of the need to reduce overall healthcare costs and
excess laboratory testing capacity led to revenue and profit declines across
the diagnostic testing industry which in turn led to industry consolidation
particularly among commercial laboratories as a result of these dynamics fewer
but larger commercial laboratories have emerged which have greater economies of
scale rigorous programs designed to assure compliance with government billing
regulations and other laws and a more disciplined approach to pricing services
these changes have resulted in improved profitability and a reduced risk of
noncompliance with complex government regulations at the same time a slowdown
in the growth of managed care and decreasing influence by managed care
organizations on the ordering of clinical laboratory testing by physicians has
contributed to renewed growth in testing volumes and further improvements in
profitability since 1999 partially offsetting these favorable trends have been
changes in the united states economy during the last several years which have
resulted in an increase in the number of unemployed and uninsured in addition
in an attempt to slow the rapidly rising costs of healthcare employers and
healthcare insurers have made design changes to healthcare plans which shift a
larger portion of healthcare costs to consumers we believe these factors have
reduced the utilization of healthcare services in general orders for laboratory
testing are generated from physician offices hospitals and employers as such
factors such as the number of unemployed and uninsured and design changes in
healthcare plans which impact the level of employment or the number of
physicians office and hospital visits will impact the utilization of
laboratory testing

    we believe the diagnostic testing industry has continued to grow during the
last several years despite the slowdown in the united states economy and the
changes in healthcare plan design and that growth will accelerate as the
economy improves in addition over the longer term growth is expected to
accelerate as a result of the following factors

    o  general expansion and aging of the united states population

    o  continuing research and development in the area of genomics and
       proteomics which is expected to yield new more sophisticated and
       specialized diagnostic tests

    o  increasing recognition by consumers and payers of the value of early
       detection and prevention which can be provided through laboratory
       testing as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of
       healthcare and

    o  increasing affordability of tests due to advances in technology and cost
       efficiencies

       are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovation to the
       market see our services  new test introductions

       we believe that with the unveiling of the human genome new genes and
       the linkages of genes with disease will continue to be discovered at an
       accelerating pace leading to research that will result in ever more
       complex and thorough predictive diagnostic and therapeutic testing we
       believe that we are well positioned to capture much of this growth

       we continue to invest in the development and improvement of our
       information technology products for customers and providers by developing
       differentiated products that will provide friendlier easier access to
       ordering and resulting of laboratory tests and patientcentric

recent acquisitions

    on february 28 2003 we completed the acquisition of unilab corporation or
unilab the leading commercial clinical laboratory in california in connection
with the acquisition we issued approximately 74 million shares of quest
diagnostics common stock including 03 million shares of quest diagnostics
common stock reserved for outstanding stock options of unilab which were
converted upon the completion of the acquisition into options to acquire shares
of quest diagnostics common stock paid 297 million in cash and repaid 220
million of debt representing substantially all of unilabs then existing
outstanding indebtedness

    in connection with the acquisition of unilab as part of a settlement
agreement with the united states federal trade commission we entered into an
agreement to sell to laboratory corporation of america holdings inc or
labcorp certain assets in northern california for 45 million including the
assignment of agreements with four independent physician associations or ipa
and leases for 46 patient service centers five of which also serve as rapid
response laboratories approximately 27 million in annual net revenues were
generated by capitated fees under the ipa contracts and associated
feeforservice testing for physicians whose patients use these patient service
centers as well as from specimens received directly from the ipa physicians we
completed the transfer of assets and assignment of the ipa agreements to labcorp
during the third quarter of 2003

    as part of the unilab acquisition we acquired all of unilabs operations
including its primary testing facilities in los angeles san jose and
sacramento california approximately 365 patient service centers 35 rapid
response laboratories and approximately 4100 employees following the sale of
certain assets to labcorp we closed our previously owned clinical laboratory in
the san francisco bay area and completed the integration

of remaining customers in the northern california area to unilabs laboratories
in san jose and sacramento we continue to have two laboratories in the los
angeles metropolitan area our facilities in van nuys and tarzana we plan to
open a new regional laboratory in the los angeles metropolitan area and then
integrate our business in the los angeles metropolitan area into the new
facility we expect to incur up to 20 million of costs through 2005 to
integrate unilab and our existing california operations upon completion of the
unilab integration we expect to realize approximately 25 million to 30
million of annual synergies we expect to achieve this annual rate of synergies
by the end of 2005

    on april 1 2002 we acquired american medical laboratories incorporated
or aml and an affiliated company of aml labportal inc a provider of
electronic connectivity products in an allcash transaction valued at
approximately 500 million which included the assumption of approximately 160
million in debt aml was a national provider of esoteric testing to hospitals
and specialty physicians and a leading provider of diagnostic testing services
in the nevada and metropolitan washington dc markets the companys
chantilly virginia laboratory acquired as part of the aml acquisition has
become our primary esoteric testing laboratory and hospital service center for
the eastern united states complementing our nichols institute esoteric testing
facility in san juan capistrano california esoteric testing volumes have been
redirected within our national network to provide customers with improved
turnaround time and customer service we have completed the transition of
certain routine clinical laboratory testing previously performed in the
chantilly virginia laboratory to other testing facilities within our regional
laboratory network

    following an acquisition the integration process requires the dedication of
significant management resources which could result in a loss of momentum in
the activities of our business and may cause an interruption of or
deterioration in our services as a result of the following difficulties among
others

    o  a loss of key customers or employees

    o  inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies between
       the acquired company and our existing operations may make it more
       difficult to implement and harmonize companywide financial accounting
       billing information and other systems

    o  failure to maintain the quality of services that the company has
       historically provided

    o  diversion of managements attention from the daytoday business of our
       company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions
       and difficulties and

    o  the added costs of dealing with such disruptions

    since most of our clinical laboratory testing is performed under
arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice any interruption
of or deterioration in our services may also result in a customers decision
to stop using us for clinical laboratory testing these events could have a
material adverse impact on our business however management believes that the
successful implementation of our integration plans and our value proposition
based on expanded patient access our broad testing capabilities and most
importantly the quality of the services we provide will mitigate customer
attrition

our services

    our laboratory testing business consists of routine testing esoteric
testing and clinical trials testing routine testing generates approximately
80 of our net revenues esoteric and genebased testing generates approximately
16 of our net revenues and clinical trials testing generates less than 3 of
our net revenues we derive less than 2 of our net revenues from foreign
operations

routine testing

    routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as the
functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly
ordered tests include

    o  blood cholesterol level tests

    o  complete blood cell counts

    o  pap tests

    o  hivrelated tests

    o  urinalyses

    o  pregnancy and other prenatal tests and

    o  alcohol and other substanceabuse tests

                                       4


page

    we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories rapid
response laboratories or stat labs and patient service centers we also
perform routine testing at the hospital laboratories we manage major
laboratories offer a full line of routine clinical tests rapid response
laboratories are local facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated
group of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times
patient service centers are facilities where specimens are collected these
centers are typically located in or near a building used by medical
professionals

    we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most
routine procedures within 24 hours most test results are delivered
electronically

esoteric testing

    esoteric tests are those tests that require more sophisticated technology
equipment and materials professional handson attention and more highly
skilled professional and technical personnel and may be performed less
frequently than routine tests because it is not costeffective for most
clinical laboratories to perform a low volume of esoteric tests inhouse they
generally refer many of these tests to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory
that specializes in performing these more complex tests due to their
complexity esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than
routine tests

    our two esoteric testing laboratories which conduct business as quest
diagnostics nichols institute are among the leading esoteric clinical testing
laboratories in the world in 1998 our esoteric testing laboratory in san juan
capistrano california became the first clinical laboratory in north america to
achieve iso9001 certification our esoteric testing laboratory in chantilly
virginia acquired as part of the aml acquisition now enables us to provide
full esoteric testing services including genebased testing on the east coast
our two esoteric testing laboratories perform hundreds of esoteric tests that
are not routinely performed by our regional laboratories these esoteric tests
are generally in the following fields

    o  endocrinology and metabolism the study of glands their hormone
       secretions and their effects on body growth and metabolism

    o  genetics the study of chromosomes genes and their protein products and
       effects

    o  hematology the study of blood and bone marrow cells and coagulation
       the process of blood clotting

    o  immunology the study of the immune system including antibodies immune
       system cells and their effects

    o  microbiology and infectious diseases the study of microscopic forms of
       life including bacteria viruses fungi and other infectious agents

    o  oncology the study of abnormal cell growth including benign tumors and
       cancer

    o  serology a science dealing with the body fluids and their analysis
       including antibodies proteins and other characteristics

    o  special chemistry more sophisticated testing requiring special expertise
       and technology and

    o  toxicology the study of chemicals and drugs and their effects on the
       bodys metabolism

new test introductions

    we intend to build upon our reputation as a leading innovator in the
clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce new diagnostic tests as
the industry leader with the largest and broadest network and the leading
provider of esoteric testing including genebased testing we believe that we
are the best partner for developers of new technology and tests to introduce
their products to the marketplace

    during 2003 we continued to be a leading innovator in the industry through
both tests that we developed at nichols institute the largest provider of
molecular diagnostic testing in the united states as well as through
relationships with technology developers during 2003 we developed and
introduced

    o  more than 15 comprehensive panels utilizing our menu of over 100 tests to
       assist physicians with diagnosis and management of patients with bleeding
       or blood clotting disorders

    o  over 15 new infectious disease tests including dna assays for west nile
       and sars infection and

    o  a biomarker assay that provides information on recurrence risk and
       biologic behavior of node negative breast cancer to guide therapy for
       the 30 of women with node negative disease

                                       5

    during 2003 we inaugurated a molecular endocrinology laboratory with
introduction of the first commercial dna tests for central and nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus di congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah and thyroid
hormone resistance thr the di tests bypass the complicated perturbation tests
used for differential diagnosis of the several disorders cah testing is offered
as a dna analysis for the most common mutations and as a cah complete gene
sequencing for the 60 deleterious mutations known to be associated with this
wide spectrum of adrenal function disorders the thr testing provides definitive
diagnosis for children with hypothyroidism of variable extent associated with
the defective hormone receptor

    through our relationship with members of the academic community and
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms as well as our collaboration with
emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel
diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we believe that we are one
of the leaders in transferring technical innovation to the market during 2003
we entered into a variety of strategic technology arrangements including

    o  an agreement with enterix inc under which we have begun to offer the
       insuretm test an fdacleared fecal immunochemical screening test for
       colorectal cancer unlike other noninvasive colorectal cancer screening
       technologies the insuretm test is easy for patients to use and
       requires no handling of fecal matter

    o  an agreement with diadexus under which we are expanding our heart disease
       test offering through the lppla2 test which enables physicians to
       detect a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease by measuring
       levels of the enzyme lipoproteinassociated phospholipase a2 and

    o  a relationship with thermo electron under which we are developing a
       biochipbased test for the detection of cystic fibrosis cf gene
       mutations during prenatal screening

    through our research and development marketing and commercial alliance with
roche diagnostics we were the first laboratory to offer several new tests
developed by roche including its elecsys ntprobnp test which aids in the
diagnosis of congestive heart failure our relationship with celera diagnostics
gives us access to potentially significant markers for the risk of
cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death in the united states and
diabetes our relationship with correlogic systems has gained access to its new
ovarian cancer blood test which we hope will be available to the marketplace in
2004 and will be the first protein pattern recognition blood test to detect
ovarian cancer in women who are already considered high risk

    we believe that with the unveiling of the human genome new genes and the
linkages of genes with disease will continue to be discovered at an accelerating
pace leading to research that will result in ever more complex and thorough
predictive diagnostic and therapeutic testing we believe that we are well
positioned to capture much of this growth

clinical trials testing

    we believe that we are the worlds second largest provider of clinical
laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new
drugs in the world clinical research trials are required by the food and drug
administration or fda and other international regulatory authorities to assess
the safety and efficacy of new drugs we have clinical trials testing centers in
the united states and in england we also provide clinical trials testing in
australia singapore and south africa through arrangements with third parties
clinical trials involving new drugs are increasingly being performed both inside
and outside the united states approximately 45 of our net revenues from
clinical trials testing in 2003 represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc or
gsk we currently have a longterm contractual relationship with gsk under
which we are the primary provider of testing to support gsks clinical trials
testing requirements worldwide

other services and products

    we manufacture and market diagnostic test kits and systems primarily for
esoteric testing under the nichols institute diagnostics brand name these are
sold principally to hospitals clinical laboratories and dialysis centers
both domestically and internationally our medplus subsidiary is a developer and
integrator of clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare
organizations and clinicians primarily through its chartmaxxr electronic
medical record system during 2003 we began deploying emaxxr a new
physicians internet portal across the united states the internet portal was
developed by medplus and can provide physicians a patientcentric view of
laboratory test results and other clinical information online

payers and customers

    we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers we
consider a payer as the party that pays for the test and a customer as the
party who refers the test to us depending on the billing arrangement and
applicable law the payer may be 1 the physician or other party such as
another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to us 2 the
patient or 3 a third party who pays the bill for the patient such as an
insurance company medicare or medicaid some states including new york new
jersey and rhode island prohibit us from billing physician clients we consider
a managed care organization as both our customer and a payer when it contracts
with us on an exclusive or semiexclusive basis on behalf of its patients

    during 2003 only two customers accounted for more than 5 of our net
revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 7 of our net revenues
we believe that the loss of any one of our customers would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

customers

    physicians

    physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary source of our
clinical laboratory testing volume we typically bill physician accounts on a
feeforservice basis fees billed to physicians are based on the laboratorys
client fee schedule and are typically negotiated fees billed to patients and
insurance companies are based on the laboratorys patient fee schedule subject
to any limitations on fees negotiated with the insurance companies or with
physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are
based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities

    managed care organizations and other insurance providers

    health insurers which typically contract with a limited number of clinical
laboratories for their members represent approximately onehalf of our total
testing volumes and onehalf of our net revenues larger health insurers
typically prefer to use large commercial clinical laboratories because they can
provide services on a national or regional basis and can manage networks of
local or regional laboratories to provide even broader access to their members
and physicians in addition larger laboratories are better able to achieve the
lowcost structures necessary to profitably service large health insurers and
can provide test utilization data across their various plans in a consistent
format in certain markets such as california many health insurers delegate
their covered members to independent physician associations which in turn
contract with laboratories for clinical laboratory services

    over the last decade health insurers have been consolidating resulting in
fewer but larger insurers with significant bargaining power in negotiating fee
arrangements with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories these
health insurers demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept
discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk
associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated
payment contracts under these capitated payment contracts the company and
health insurers agree to a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each
member of the health insurers plan regardless of the number or cost of services
provided by the company some services such as various esoteric tests new
technologies and anatomic pathology services may be carved out from a capitated
rate and if carved

                                       7

out are charged on a feeforservice basis we work closely with health
insurers as they evaluate new tests however as innovation in the testing
area increases there is no guarantee that health insurers will agree to carve
out these services or reimburse them at rates that reflect the true cost or
value associated with such services

    in recent years there has been a shift in the way major insurers contract
with clinical laboratories health insurers have begun to offer more freedom of
choice to their affiliated physicians including greater freedom to determine
which laboratory to use and which tests to order accordingly most of our
agreements with major health insurers are nonexclusive contracts as a result
under these nonexclusive arrangements physicians have more freedom of choice
in selecting laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on the
basis of service and quality rather than price alone also health insurers have
been giving patients greater freedom of choice and patients have increasingly
been selecting plans such as preferred provider organizations and consumer
driven plans that offer a greater choice of providers pricing for these
preferred provider organizations is typically negotiated on a feeforservice
basis which generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under a
capitated fee arrangement despite these trends health insurers continue to
aggressively seek cost reductions in order to keep their premiums to their
customers competitive if we are unable to agree on pricing with a health
insurer we would become a nonparticipating provider and could then only
bill the ordering physician or the patient rather than the health insurer
this nonparticipating status could lead to loss of business since the
physician is likely to refer testing to a participating provider whose testing
is covered by the patients health insurance benefit plan we cannot assure
investors that we will continue to be successful in negotiating contracts
with major insurers loss of multiple major insurer or other payer agreements
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of
operations and cash flows

    we offer questnettm an innovative product to develop and manage a
customized network of clinical laboratory providers for health insurers through
questnettm physicians and members are provided multiple choices for clinical
laboratory testing while health insurers realize cost reductions under a single
capitated arrangement

    hospitals

    we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states that vary from
esoteric testing to helping manage their laboratories we believe that we are
the industrys market leader in servicing hospitals our hospital customers
account for approximately 13 of our net revenues the majority of which
represents services billed to the hospitals under reference testing
arrangements based on negotiated fee schedules for certain testing that the
hospitals do not perform internally hospitals generally maintain an onsite
laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer less frequently needed and
highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which typically charge
the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis we believe that most
hospital laboratories perform approximately 90 to 95 of their patients
clinical laboratory tests in addition many hospitals compete with commercial
clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing most
physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals as
part of their medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships with
community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing
to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician
practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospitals
affiliated laboratory as a result hospitalaffiliated laboratories can be both
customers and competitors for commercial clinical laboratories

    during 2002 in conjunction with the acquisition of aml we launched
dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique needs of
hospital customers we believe that the combination of fullservice bicoastal
esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals for
consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality and
dedicated sales and service professionals has positioned us to be a partner of
choice for hospital customers

    we have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated health delivery
networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which
provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians
and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas serve as our principal
laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a
majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for
our hospital joint venture relationships we also manage the laboratories at a
number of other hospitals

    employers governmental institutions and other clinical laboratories

    we provide testing services to federal state and local governmental
agencies and to large employers we believe that we are the leading provider of
clinical laboratory testing to employers for drugs of abuse we also provide
wellness testing to employers to enable employees to take an active role in
improving their health testing services for employers account for approximately
3 of our net revenues the volume of testing services for employers which
generally have relatively low profit margins has declined significantly during
2001 through 2003 driven by a slowdown in hiring we also perform esoteric
testing services for other commercial clinical laboratories that do not have a
full range of testing capabilities all of these customers are charged on a
feeforservice basis

    consumers

    consumers are becoming increasingly interested in managing their own health
and health records currently almost all the testing we perform is ordered
directly by a physician who then receives the test results however over time
we believe that consumers will increasingly want to order clinical laboratory
tests themselves to that end we offer a focused menu of clinical laboratory
testing directly to consumers in certain states consumers pay for and receive
the test results directly in each case a physician reviews the order and
result we believe this market will continue to grow over time

sales and marketing

    we market to and service our customers through our direct sales force
customer service and patient service representatives and couriers

    we focus our sales efforts on obtaining and retaining profitable accounts
we have an active account management process to evaluate the profitability of
all of our accounts where appropriate we change the service levels terminate
accounts that are not profitable or adjust pricing

    our sales force is organized by customer type with the majority of
representatives focused on marketing laboratory services to physicians
including specialty physicians such as oncologists cardiologists and
gastroenterologists additionally we have a managed care sales organization
that maintains relationships with regional and national insurance and managed
care organizations we also have a hospital sales organization that focuses on
meeting the unique needs of hospitals and leverages the specialized capabilities
of our nichols institute esoteric testing laboratories supporting our hospital
and physician sales teams are genomics and esoteric testing specialists who are
specially trained and focused on marketing and selling more complex tests to our
customers a smaller portion of our sales force focuses on selling substanceof
abuse testing to employers

    customer service representatives perform a number of services for patients
and customers they monitor services answer questions and help resolve
problems our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily

    our corporate marketing function is organized by customer and is responsible
for developing and executing marketing strategies new product launches and
promotional and advertising support the marketing function is also responsible
for customer satisfaction surveys market research tradeshow administration
database marketing tools and marketplace trending and analysis

strategic growth opportunities

    in addition to expanding our core clinical laboratory business through
internal growth and pursuing our strategy to become a leading provider of
medical information we intend to continue to leverage our network in order to
capitalize on targeted growth opportunities both inside and outside our core
laboratory testing business these opportunities include

    o  genebased and other esoteric tests we intend to remain a leading
       innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to introduce
       new tests technology and services we estimate that the current united
       states market in esoteric testing including genebased testing is 3
       billion to 4 billion per year we believe that we have the largest
       genebased testing business in the united states with greater than
       500 million in net revenues during 2003 and that this business has been
       growing by more than 20 per year we believe that the unveiling of the
       human genome the discovery of new genes and the linkages of these genes
       with disease will result in more complex and thorough predictive
       diagnostic and therapeutic testing we believe that we are well
       positioned to realize this growth we intend to focus on
       commercializing diagnostic applications of discoveries in the areas of
       functional genomics the analysis

                                       9

       of genes and their functions and proteomics the discovery of new
       proteins made possible by the human genome project

    o  anatomic pathology while we are one of the leading providers of anatomic
       pathology services in the united states we have traditionally been
       strongest in cytology and specifically in the analysis of pap tests to
       detect cervical cancer during the last several years we have led the
       industry in converting over 80 of our pap smear business to the use of
       liquidbased technology for cervical cancer screening a higher quality
       and more profitable product offering we intend to continue to expand our
       anatomic pathology business into higher growth segments including
       histology tissue pathology and actively participate in the emerging
       use of molecular testing as a screening tool in conjunction with pap
       tests we estimate that the current united states market for anatomic
       pathology services is approximately 6 billion per year we estimate
       that cytology represents about 1 billion per year of this market and
       that tissue pathology represents about 5 billion per year of this
       market we generated approximately 500 million in net revenues from
       such services during 2003

    o  information technology we continue to invest in the development and
       improvement of information technology products for customers and
       providers by developing differentiated products that will provide
       friendlier easier access to ordering and resulting of laboratory tests
       and patientcentric information in february 2003 we launched our
       proprietary emaxxr internet portal to physicians nationwide the
       emaxxr internet portal enables doctors to order diagnostic tests and
       review laboratory results online as well as check patients insurance
       eligibility in real time and view clinical information from many sources
       in pilot markets physicians are also able to use emaxxr to prescribe
       pharmaceuticals this service allows us to replace older technology
       desktop products that we currently provide to many physicians and
       thereby streamline our support structure demand has been growing for
       our information technology solutions as physician offices have expanded
       their usage of the internet by the end of 2003 we were receiving
       approximately 25 of all test orders and delivering about 35 of all
       test results via the internet

       the emaxxr internet portal was developed by medplus inc or medplus
       which we acquired in november 2001 medplus chartmaxxr and emaxxr
       patient record systems are designed to support the creation and
       management of electronic patient records by bringing together in one
       patientcentric view information from various sources including the
       physicians records and laboratory and hospital data we intend to
       expand the services offered through our portal over time as other
       strategic arrangements are realized which will enhance our ability to
       introduce a broad range of electronic services to healthcare providers

    o  selective regional acquisitions the clinical laboratory industry remains
       highly fragmented we expect to continue to acquire other regional
       clinical laboratories that can be integrated with our existing
       laboratories thereby enabling us to reduce costs and improve
       efficiencies through the elimination of redundant facilities and
       equipment and reductions in personnel see recent acquisitions for a
       discussion of our recent acquisitions we may also consider
       acquisitions of ancillary businesses as part of our overall growth
       strategy such as our november 2001 acquisition of medplus which
       develops clinical connectivity products designed to enhance patient
       care see information technology

information systems

    information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our
business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics
and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued
and uninterrupted performance of our information technology or it systems
computer systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including
telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural
disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are
potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and
similar disruptive problems despite the precautionary measures that we have
taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our it systems
sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process test
orders deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely
affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues

    during the 1980s and early 1990s when we acquired many of our laboratory
facilities our regional laboratories were operated as local decentralized
units and we did not standardize their billing laboratory and some of their
other information systems as a result by the end of 1995 we had many different
information

                                       10

systems for billing test results reporting and other transactions over
time the growth in the size and network of our customers and the increasing
complexity of billing demonstrated a greater need for standardized systems

    during 2002 we began implementation of a standard laboratory information
system and a standard billing system we expect that deployment of the
standardized systems will take several more years to complete and will result in
significantly more centralized systems than we have today we expect the
integration of these systems will improve operating efficiency and provide
management with more timely and comprehensive information with which to make
management decisions however failure to properly implement this
standardization process could materially adversely impact us during system
conversions of this type workflow may be reengineered to take advantage of
enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service
in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and
master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks that
need to be managed carefully

billing

    billing for laboratory services is complicated depending on the billing
arrangement and applicable law we must bill various payers such as patients
insurance companies medicare medicaid doctors and employer groups all of
which have different requirements additionally auditing for compliance with
applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and
procedures adds further complexity to the billing process among many other
factors complicating billing are

    o  pricing differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates
       of the payers

    o  disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for payment and

    o  disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers

    we incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation in
medicare and medicaid programs as billing and reimbursement for clinical
laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal and state
regulations these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity
added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and
customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other
factors medical necessity denials and advance beneficiary notices compliance
with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies
and procedures adds further complexity and costs to the billing process
changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our
clients the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms formerly the
health care financing administration establishes procedures and continuously
evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process

    we believe that most of our bad debt expense which was 48 of our net
revenues in 2003 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing
information on requisitions received from healthcare providers rather than
credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report
test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or
missing we subsequently attempt to contact the provider to obtain any missing
information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect
information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process
creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of
accounts receivable when all issues relating to the missing or incorrect
information are not resolved in a timely manner the related receivables are
written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts

    we have implemented best practices for billing that have significantly
reduced the percentage of requisitions with missing billing information from
approximately 16 at the beginning of 1996 to approximately 4 in 2003 these
initiatives together with our six sigma and standardization initiatives and
progress in dealing with medicare medical necessity documentation requirements
have significantly reduced bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues from
about 7 during 1996 to 48 during 2003 we believe that in the longer term
with a continuing focus on process discipline and the increased use of
electronic ordering by our customers bad debt as a percentage of net revenues
can be reduced to 4 or less see regulation of reimbursement for clinical
laboratory services

competition

    while there has been significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory
testing business in recent years our industry remains fragmented and highly
competitive we compete with three types of laboratory providers
hospitalaffiliated laboratories other commercial clinical laboratories and
physicianoffice laboratories we are the leading clinical laboratory provider
in the united states with net revenues of 47 billion during 2003 and
facilities in substantially all of the countrys major metropolitan areas our
largest competitor is labcorp in

                                       11


page

addition we compete with and service many smaller regional and local
commercial clinical laboratories as well as laboratories owned by physicians
and hospitals see payers and customers  customers

    we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when
selecting a laboratory including

    o  service capability and quality

    o  accuracy timeliness and consistency in reporting test results

    o  number and type of tests performed by the laboratory

    o  number convenience and geographic coverage of patient service centers

    o  reputation in the medical community and

    o  pricing

    we believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas

    we believe that large commercial clinical laboratories may be able to
increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to
their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should
enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers
including managed care organizations in addition we believe that consolidation
in the clinical laboratory testing business will continue however a majority
of the clinical laboratory testing is likely to continue to be performed by
hospitals which generally have affiliations with community physicians that
refer testing to us see payers and customers  customers  hospitals as
a result of these affiliations we compete against hospitalaffiliated
laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well
as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service superior to
hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could negatively
impact our net revenues

    the diagnostic testing industry is faced with changing technology and new
product introductions advances in technology may lead to the development of
more costeffective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical
laboratory such as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians
in their offices and 2 home testing that can be performed by patients or by
physicians in their offices development of such technology and its use by our
customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and
negatively impact our net revenues see regulation of clinical laboratory
operations

quality assurance

    our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection storage and
transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy of
analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on
proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and personnel
training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we continue to
implement our six sigma and standardization initiatives to help achieve our goal
of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare
services industry our nichols institute facility in san juan capistrano was the
first clinical laboratory in north america to achieve iso9001 certification
two of our clinical trials laboratories our diagnostic kits facility and one of
our routine laboratories have also achieved iso9001 certification these
certifications are international standards for quality management systems

    internal proficiency testing quality control and audits quality control
samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the
results of tests on quality control samples are monitored to identify trends
biases or imprecision in the analytical processes we also perform internal
process audits as part of our comprehensive quality assurance program

    external proficiency testing and accreditation all of our laboratories
participate in various external quality surveillance programs they include
proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american
pathologists or cap as well as some state agencies

    cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of board certified
pathologists cap is approved by cms to inspect clinical laboratories to
determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory
improvement amendments of 1988 or clia cap offers an accreditation program to
which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional
laboratories are accredited by cap accreditation includes onsite inspections
and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing program

regulation of clinical laboratory operations

    the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and state
regulation including inspections and audits by governmental agencies
governmental authorities may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other
actions to enforce laws and regulations including revoking a clinical
laboratorys federal certification to operate a clinical laboratory operation
changes in regulation may increase the costs of performing clinical laboratory
tests increase the administrative requirements of claims or decrease the amount
of reimbursement

    clia and state regulation all of our laboratories and where applicable
patient service centers are licensed and accredited by the appropriate federal
and state agencies clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by
requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various
operational personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that their
clinical laboratory testing services are accurate reliable and timely clia
does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law for
example state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality
control record maintenance andor proficiency testing the cost of compliance
with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical
laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of laboratory equipment
and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing pointofcare
laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home
use to both physicians and patients diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the
fda for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and
may be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory
oversight as well as by patients in their homes

    drug testing the substance abuse and mental health services administration
or samhsa regulates drug testing for public sector employees and employees of
certain federally regulated businesses samhsa has established detailed
performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to perform drug
testing on these employees all laboratories that perform such testing must be
certified as meeting samhsa standards

    controlled substances the federal drug enforcement administration or dea
regulates access to controlled substances used to perform drugs of abuse
testing laboratories that use controlled substances are licensed by the dea

    medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical
laboratories are also subject to federal state and local regulations relating
to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and
radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of such
waste

    fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits
reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical
laboratories in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over
laboratorydeveloped tests but has exercised enforcement discretion in not
regulating most laboratorydeveloped tests performed by high complexity
cliacertified laboratories in december 2000 the department of health and
human services or hhs secretarys advisory committee on genetic testing
recommended that the fda be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing
in late 2002 a new hhs secretarys advisory committee on genetics health and
society was appointed to replace the prior advisory committee but it has not
yet made any final recommendations in the meantime the fda is considering
revising its regulations on analyte specific reagents which are used in
laboratorydeveloped tests including laboratory developed genetic testing
representatives of clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics and the
american clinical laboratory association our industry trade association have
met with representatives of the fda to address industry issues pertaining to
potential fda regulation of genetic testing in general and issues with regard to
the impact of potential increased oversight over analyte specific reagents we
expect those discussions to continue increased fda regulation of the reagents
used in laboratorydeveloped testing could lead to increased costs and delays in
introducing new tests including genetic tests

    occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health
administration or osha has established extensive requirements relating
specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers this includes
developing and implementing multifaceted programs to protect workers from
exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and hepatitis b and c including
preventing or minimizing any exposure through sharps or needle stick injuries

    specimen transportation transportation of most clinical laboratory
specimens and hazardous materials is subject to regulation by the department of
transportation the public health service the united states postal service and
the international civil aviation organization

    corporate practice of medicine many states including some in which our
principal laboratories are located prohibit corporations from engaging in the
practice of medicine the corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been

privacy and security of health information standard transactions

    pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996
or hipaa the secretary of hhs has issued final regulations designed to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the
electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative
transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information
exchanged three principal regulations have been issued in final form privacy
regulations security regulations and standards for electronic transactions

    the hipaa privacy regulations which fully came into effect in april 2003
establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and
disclosures of protected health information by health plans healthcare
providers and healthcare clearinghouses the regulations establish a complex
regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including

    o  the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health
       information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by
       the patient including but not limited to treatment purposes activities
       to obtain payment for our services and our health care operations
       activities

    o  a patients rights to access amend and receive an accounting of certain
       disclosures of protected health information

    o  the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health
       information and

    o  administrative technical and physical safeguards required of entities
       that use or receive protected health information

    we have implemented the hipaa privacy regulations as required by law the
hipaa privacy regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws
that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal
privacy standards and varying state privacy laws in addition for healthcare
data transfers relating to citizens of other countries we need to comply with
the laws of other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our
ability to use or disclose patientidentifiable laboratory data without patient
authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare
operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public
policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the final privacy
regulations the privacy regulations provide for significant fines and other
penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information
including potential loss of licensure and civil and criminal fines and
penalties although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide
for a private right of damages we also could incur damages under state laws to
private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health
information or other private personal information

    the final hipaa security regulations which establish requirements for
safeguarding electronic patient information were published on february 20 2003
and became effective on april 21 2003 although healthcare providers have until
april 20 2005 to comply we are conducting an analysis to determine the proper
security measures to reasonably and appropriately comply with the standards and
implementation specifications by the compliance deadline of april 20 2005

    the final hipaa regulations for electronic transactions which we refer to
as the transaction standards establish uniform standards for electronic
transactions and code sets including the electronic transactions and code sets
used for claims remittance advices enrollment and eligibility the transaction
standards became effective in october 2002 although covered entities were
eligible to obtain a oneyear extension if approved through an application to
the secretary of hhs we received this oneyear extension through october 16
2003 from hhs

    hhs issued guidance on july 24 2003 stating that it would not penalize a
covered entity for postimplementation date transactions that are not fully
compliant with the transactions standards if the covered entity could
demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the standards hhs stated
purpose for this flexible enforcement position was to permit health plans to
mitigate unintended adverse effects on covered entities cash flow and business
operations during the transition to the standards as well as on the
availability and quality of patient care we continue to work in good faith to
complete the implementation of these standards with those payers who either were
not ready to exchange files in the standard formats as of the compliance date
or who have varying interpretations of the requirements working with these
payers requires that we continue to trade electronic claims files and payments
in legacy formats even after the compliance deadline of october 16 2003

                                      14

    on september 23 2003 cms announced that it would implement a contingency
plan for the medicare program to accept electronic transactions that are not
fully compliant with the transaction standards after the october 16 2003
compliance deadline the cms contingency plan as announced allows medicare
carriers to continue to accept and process medicare claims in the preoctober 16
electronic formats to give healthcare providers additional time to complete the
testing process provided that they continue to make a good faith effort to
comply with the new standards almost all other payers have followed the lead of
cms accepting legacy formats until both parties to the transactions are ready
to implement the new electronic transaction standards

    as part of its plan cms is expected to regularly reassess the readiness of
its healthcare providers to determine how long the contingency plan will remain
in effect many of our payers were not ready to implement the transaction
standards by the october 2003 compliance deadline or were not ready to test or
troubleshoot claims submissions we are working in good faith with payers that
have not converted to the new standards to reach agreement on each payers data
requirements and to test claims submissions

    the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in
interpretation by payers for instance some payers may interpret the standards
to require us to provide certain types of information including demographic
information not usually provided to us by physicians as a result of
inconsistent interpretations of transaction standards by payers or our inability
to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians
we could face increased costs and complexity a temporary disruption in
receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues we are
working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims
submissions and with our trade association and an industry coalition to
present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and
standards setting organizations

    compliance with all of the hipaa requirements requires significant capital
and personnel resources from all healthcare organizations not just quest
diagnostics while we believe that our total costs to comply with hipaa will not
be material to our results of operations or cash flows the potential need for
additional customer contact to obtain data for billing as a result of different
interpretations of the current regulations could impose significant additional
costs on us

regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services

    overview the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in
reimbursement practices during the past several years government payers such
as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and medicaid
which principally serves indigent patients as well as private payers and
large employers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the
cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services including clinical
laboratory services if we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments
we receive for our services by reducing costs increasing test volume andor
introducing new procedures it could have a material adverse impact on our net
revenues and profitability on the other hand we believe that laboratory tests
are an effective means to detect certain medical conditions at an earlier point
in time leading to potential reduction in other healthcare costs such as the
cost of hospitalization

    principally as a result of government reimbursement reductions and measures
adopted by cms to reduce utilization described below the percentage of our net
revenues derived from medicare and medicaid programs declined from approximately
20 in 1995 to approximately 15 in 2002 this percentage increased to
approximately 17 in 2003 principally as a result of our acquisition of unilab
which had a higher percentage of its net revenues derived from medicare and
medicaid programs while the cost to comply with medicare administrative
requirements is disproportionately higher than our cost to bill other payers
average medicare reimbursement rates approximate the companys overall average
reimbursement rate from all sources making the medicare business generally less
profitable however we believe that our other business may significantly depend
on continued participation in the medicare and medicaid programs because many
customers want a single laboratory to perform all of their clinical laboratory
testing services regardless of whether reimbursements are ultimately made by
themselves medicare medicaid or other payers

    billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to
significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations
of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of
federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in
medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal fines
and penalties and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and
authorizations necessary to operate some or all of a clinical laboratorys
business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more
than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case
of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three
times the amount

                                       15

of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the federal false
claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per violation plus up to
three times the amount claimed

    reduced reimbursements in 1984 congress established a medicare fee
schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for
patients covered under part b of the medicare program congress then imposed a
national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local
medicare fee schedules since then congress has periodically reduced the
national ceilings the medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced
in 1996 to 76 of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in
1998 to 74 of the 1984 national median the national ceiling applies to tests
for which limitation amounts were established before january 1 2001 for more
recent tests tests for which a limitation amount is first established on or
after january 1 2001 the limitation amount is set at 100 of the median of
all the local fee schedules established for that test in accordance with the
social security act the balanced budget act of 1997 eliminated the provision
for annual increases to the medicare national fee schedule based on the consumer
price index from 1998 through 2002 a 11 increase based on the consumer price
index became effective on january 1 2003 the prescription drug improvement
and modernization act of 2003 eliminated for five years beginning january 1
2004 the provision for annual increases to the medicare national fee schedule
based on the consumer price index including the adjustment which would have
been 26 that had been scheduled for january 1 2004 thus by law an
adjustment to the national fee schedule for clinical laboratory services based
on the consumer price index cannot occur before january 1 2009

    pathology services are reimbursed by medicare based on a resourcebased
relative value scale or rbrvs that is periodically updated by cms less than
1 of our net revenues are derived from pathology services reimbursed by
medicare based on rbrvs

    with regard to the rest of our laboratory services performed on behalf of
medicare beneficiaries we must bill the medicare program directly and must
accept the carriers fee schedule amount as payment in full in addition state
medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay
significantly less than medicare major clinical laboratories including quest
diagnostics typically use two fee schedules for tests billed on a
feeforservice basis

    o  client fees charged to physicians hospitals and institutions for
       which a clinical laboratory performs testing services on a wholesale
       basis and which are billed on a monthly basis these fees are generally
       subject to negotiation or discount

    o  patient fees charged to individual patients and thirdparty payers
       like medicare and medicaid these fees generally require separate bills
       for each requisition

    the fee schedule amounts established by medicare are typically substantially
lower than patient fees otherwise charged by us but are sometimes higher than
our fees actually charged to certain other clients during 1992 the office of
the inspector general or oig of the hhs issued final regulations that
prohibited charging medicare fees substantially in excess of a providers usual
charges the oig however declined to provide any guidance concerning
interpretation of these rules including whether or not discounts to non
governmental clients and payers or the dualfee structure might be inconsistent
with these rules

    a proposed rule released in september 1997 would have authorized the oig to
exclude providers from participation in the medicare program including clinical
laboratories that charge medicare and other programs fees that are
substantially in excess of    usual charges    to any of their
customers clients or patients this proposal was withdrawn by the oig in 1998
in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion which indicated that a
clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the usual
charges regulation if the charge to medicare substantially exceeds the amount
the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept
from nonfederal payers the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that
the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to
private pay customers

    in september 2003 the oig published a notice of proposed rulemaking that
would amend the oigs exclusion regulations addressing excessive claims under
the proposed exclusion rule the oig would have the authority to exclude a
provider for submitting claims to medicare that contain charges that are
substantially in excess of the providers usual charges the proposal would
define usual charges as the average payment from nongovernment entities on a
test by test basis excluding capitated payments and would define
substantially in excess to be an amount that is more than 20 greater than the
usual charge we believe that the rule is unnecessary because congress has
already established fee schedules for the services that the rule proposes to
regulate we also believe that the rule is unworkable and overly burdensome
through our industry trade association we filed comments opposing the proposed
rule and we are working with our trade association and a coalition of other
healthcare providers who also oppose this proposed regulation as drafted if
this regulation is

                                       16

adopted as proposed it could potentially reduce the amounts reimbursed to us
by medicare and other federal payers or affect the fees we charge to other
payers and could also be costly for us to administer

    the 1997 balanced budget act permits cms to adjust statutorily prescribed
fees for some medical services including clinical laboratory services if the
fees are grossly excessive in december 2002 cms issued an interim final rule
setting forth a process and factors for establishing a realistic and equitable
payment amount for all medicare part b services except physician services and
services paid under a prospective payment system when the existing payment
amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be
considered unreasonable because they are either grossly excessive or deficient
we cannot provide any assurances to investors that fees payable by medicare
could not be reduced as a result of the application of this rule or that the
government might not assert claims for reimbursement by purporting to
retroactively apply this rule or the oig interpretation concerning usual
charges

    currently medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a copayment for
clinical laboratory testing when copayments were last in effect before
adoption of the clinical laboratory services fee schedules in 1984 clinical
laboratories received from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed
amount and were required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid balance
of the medicare allowed amount if reenacted a copayment requirement could
adversely affect the revenues of the clinical laboratory industry including us
by exposing the testing laboratory to the credit of individuals and by
increasing the number of bills in addition a laboratory could be subject to
potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate procedures to bill and collect
the copayments are not established and followed the medicare reform bill
approved by the united state senate in june 2003 included a copayment
provision under which clinical laboratories would receive from medicare
carriers only 80 of the medicare allowed amount for clinical laboratory tests
and would be required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the 20 balance of
the medicare allowed amount the copayment provision was dropped from the
bill as passed known as prescription drug improvement and modernization act
of 2003 although the final legislation did include as discussed above a
five year freeze on adjustments to the medicare national fee schedule based on
the consumer price index certain medicaid programs do provide copayments for
clinical laboratory testing

    reduced utilization of clinical laboratory testing in recent years cms has
taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory testing since
1995 medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay for
many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided
an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test
physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order
clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients however cms has not
prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide diagnostic information
to laboratories moreover regulations adopted in accordance with hipaa require
submission of diagnosis codes as part of the standard claims transaction

    we are generally permitted to bill patients directly for some statutorily
excluded clinical laboratory services if a patient signs an advance beneficiary
notice or abn we are also generally permitted to bill patients for clinical
laboratory tests that medicare does not cover due to medical necessity
limitations these tests include limited coverage tests for which the ordering
physician did not provide an appropriate diagnosis code and certain tests
ordered on a patient at a frequency greater than covered by medicare an abn is
a notice signed by the beneficiary which documents the patients informed
decision to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which are
likely to be not covered by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically
necessary we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in
such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the
physicians office staff if the abn is not timely provided to the beneficiary
or is not completed properly we end up performing tests that we cannot
subsequently bill to the patient if they are not reimbursable by medicare due to
coverage limitations

    inconsistent practices currently many different local carriers administer
medicare they have inconsistent policies on matters such as 1 test coverage
2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims documentation
and 5 fee schedules subject to the national fee schedule limitations
inconsistent carrier rules and policies have increased the complexity of the
billing process for clinical laboratories as part of the 1997 balanced budget
act hhs was required to adopt uniform policies on the above matters by january
1 1999 and replace the current local carriers with no more than five regional
carriers although hhs has finalized a number of uniform test coveragediagnosis
coding policies it has not taken any final action to replace the local carriers
with five regional carriers however in november 2000 cms published a
solicitation in the commerce business daily seeking two contractors to process
part b clinical laboratory claims in the solicitation cms stated that the
secretary has decided to limit the number of carriers processing clinical
diagnostic laboratory test claims to two contractors the solicitation indicated
that the request for proposals or rfp would be released

                                       17

on or before december 31 2000 but as of february 2004 the rfp had not been
issued the solicitation did not indicate the effective date for a final
transition to the regional carrier model cms plans to achieve standardization
in part through implementing a single claims processing system for all
carriers this initiative however was suspended due to cmss year 2000
compliance priorities

    carrier jurisdiction changes for labtolab referrals on october 31 2003
cms announced its intention to change the manner in which medicare contractors
currently process claims for labtolab referrals while laboratories are under
certain criteria permitted to directly bill medicare for tests they refer to
other laboratories they must be reimbursed at the correct fee schedule amount
based on the medicare fee schedule in effect in the medicare carrier region in
which the test was actually performed historically laboratories needed to
enroll with and file claims to multiple carriers in order to bill for such
outofarea test referrals to ensure receipt of the appropriate payment amount
this has proven to be an administratively difficult process with many obstacles
to obtaining accurate claims payment including applying the correct fee
schedule the announced change will enable the laboratorys home carrier to
maintain and apply the clinical laboratory fee schedule applicable to the
carrier region where the test was performed this will streamline the claims
filing process by allowing a laboratory to file all of its claims to its home
carrier as of january 2004 cms has indicated a july 1 2004 effective date for
this change

    competitive bidding the prescription drug improvement and modernization
act of 2003 requires cms to conduct and complete by december 31 2005 a
demonstration project on the application of competitive acquisition to clinical
laboratory tests the details of how this federal demonstration project will be
implemented are unknown at this time florida has issued a proposal for
competitive bidding for its medicaid program if competitive bidding were
implemented on a regional or national basis for clinical laboratory testing
it could materially adversely affect the clinical laboratory industry and us

    future legislation future changes in federal state and local regulations
or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental
reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely affect us we
cannot predict however whether and what type of legislative proposals will be
enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by regulatory authorities

    fraud and abuse regulations medicare and medicaid antikickback laws
prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other benefits
to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or other federal
programs as noted above the penalties for violation of these laws may include
criminal and civil fines and penalties andor suspension or exclusion from
participation in federal programs many of the antifraud statutes and
regulations including those relating to joint ventures and alliances are vague
or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot predict if
some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted contrary to our practices

    in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion concluding that the
industry practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if the
discounted price is below a laboratorys overall cost including overhead and
below the amounts reimbursed by medicare advisory opinions are not binding but
may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement
actions the oigs opinion if enforced could result in fines and possible
exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below
the rates reimbursed by medicare the oig subsequently issued a letter
clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se violation
of the federal antikickback statute but may merit further investigation
depending on the facts and circumstances presented

    in addition since 1992 a federal antiselfreferral law commonly known
as the stark law prohibits with certain exceptions medicare payments for
laboratory tests referred by physicians who have personally or through a family
member an investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with the
testing laboratory since january 1995 these restrictions have also applied to
medicaidcovered services many states have similar antiselfreferral and
other laws that are not limited to medicare and medicaid referrals and could
also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians we cannot
predict if some of the state laws will be interpreted contrary to our practices
in april 2003 the oig issued a special advisory bulletin addressing what it
described as questionable contractual arrangements in contractual joint
ventures the oig bulletin focused on arrangements where a health care provider
or owner expands into a related health care business by contracting with a
health care provider or manager that already is engaged in that line of
business for the manager to provide related health care items or services to the
patients of the owner in return for a share of the profits of the new line of
business while we believe that the bulletin is directed at sham arrangements
intended to induce referrals we cannot predict whether the oig might choose to
investigate all contractual joint ventures including our joint ventures with
various hospitals or hospital systems

government investigations and related claims

    we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local
laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with government
settlements and public announcements by various government officials the
federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud in
addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give
federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and
remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse many of the regulations
applicable to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests
and those relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or
indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted
or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that
could require us to make changes in our operations including our billing
practices if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could
suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our
ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state
healthcare programs

    during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled government claims
that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both
companies believed to be lawful the aggregate amount of the settlements for
these claims exceeded 500 million the federal or state governments may bring
additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to
be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in
negotiating settlements since the amount of potential fines far exceeds the
rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of
excluding a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and
medicaid programs which represented approximately 17 of our net revenues
during 2003

    although management believes that established reserves for claims are
sufficient including qui tam cases of which management is aware it is
possible that additional information may become available that may cause the
final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves by an amount
which could be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the
period in which such claims are settled we do not believe that these issues
will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition however
we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by former
employees or other whistle blowers as to which we have not been provided with
a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any
potential liability

    as an integral part of our compliance program discussed below we
investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal healthcare
reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or
medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a
result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported
overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken
corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each
instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient

compliance program

    compliance with all government rules and regulations has become a
significant concern throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of
evolving interpretations of regulations and the national debate over healthcare
we established a compliance program early in 1993

    we emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure the
strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and
company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures personnel
and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations the
quality safety and compliance committee of the board of directors requires
periodic reporting of compliance operations from management

    we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and
regulations applicable to our operations many of these statutes and regulations
have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot assure investors that
applicable statutes or regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a
prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely
affect us potential sanctions for violation of these statutes include
significant damages penalties and fines exclusion from participation in
governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates
and authorization necessary to operate some or all of our business which
could have a material adverse effect on our business

intellectual property rights

    other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain
patents or other property rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our
ability to develop perform or sell our tests or operate our business as a
result we may be involved in intellectual property litigation and we may be
found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others which could force us to
do one or more of the following

    o  cease developing performing or selling products or services that
       incorporate the challenged intellectual property

    o  obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual
       property right

    o  redesign or reengineer our tests

    o  change our business processes or

    o  pay substantial damages court costs and attorneys fees including
       potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful

    patents generally are not issued until several years after an application is
filed the possibility that before a patent is issued to a third party we may
be performing a test or other activity covered by the patent is not a defense
to an infringement claim thus even tests that we develop could become the
subject of infringement claims if a third party obtains a patent covering those
tests

    infringement and other intellectual property claims regardless of their
merit can be expensive and timeconsuming to litigate in addition any
requirement to reengineer our tests or change our business processes could
substantially increase our costs force us to interrupt product sales or delay
new test releases in the past we have settled several disputes regarding our
alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties we are
currently involved in settling several additional disputes we do not believe
that resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations cash flows or financial condition however infringement
claims could arise in the future as patents could be issued on tests or
processes that we may be performing particularly in such emerging areas as
genebased testing and other specialty testing

insurance

    as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services may
be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims these
suits could involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability
litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation
we maintain various liability insurance programs for claims that could result
from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services
including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage
limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially
selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the basis for claims
reserves incorporates actuarially determined losses based upon our historical
and projected loss experience management believes that present insurance
coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures
although management cannot predict the outcome of any claims made against the
company management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any such
proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position but may be material to our results of operations and cash flows in the
period in which such claims are resolved similarly although we believe that we
will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable
costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so

employees

    at december 31 2003 and 2002 we employed approximately 37200 and 33400
people respectively these totals exclude employees of the joint ventures where
we do not have a majority interest we have no collective bargaining agreements
with any unions covering any employees in the united states and we believe that
our overall relations with our employees are good

the united states clinical laboratory testing market

     clinical laboratory testing is an essential element in the delivery of
healthcare services physicians use laboratory tests to assist in the detection
diagnosis evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical
conditions clinical laboratory testing is generally categorized as clinical
testing and anatomic pathology testing clinical testing is performed on body
fluids such as blood and urine anatomic pathology testing is performed on
tissues and other samples such as human cells most clinical laboratory tests
are considered routine and can be performed by most independent clinical
laboratories tests that are not routine and that require more sophisticated
equipment and highly skilled personnel are considered esoteric tests esoteric
tests including genebased tests are generally referred to laboratories that
specialize in performing those tests

     we believe that the united states diagnostics testing industry had over 36
billion in annual revenues in 2002 most laboratory tests are performed by one
of three types of laboratories independent clinical laboratories
hospitalaffiliated laboratories and physicianoffice laboratories in 2002 we
believe that hospitalaffiliated laboratories performed over one half of the
clinical laboratory tests in the united states independent clinical
laboratories performed approximately onethird of those tests and
physicianoffice laboratories performed the balance

     after years of declining reimbursement and reduced test utilization during
the early to mid1990s the underlying fundamentals of the diagnostics testing
industry have improved during the last several years during the early 1990s
the industry was negatively impacted by significant government regulation and
investigations into various billing practices in addition the rapid growth of
managed care as a result of the need to reduce overall healthcare costs and





page

excess laboratory testing capacity led to revenue and profit declines across
the diagnostics testing industry which in turn led to industry consolidation
particularly among commercial laboratories as a result of these dynamics fewer
but larger commercial laboratories have emerged which have greater economies of
scale rigorous programs designed to assure compliance with government billing
regulations and other laws and a more disciplined approach to pricing services
these changes have resulted in improved profitability and a reduced risk of
noncompliance with complex government regulations at the same time a slowdown
in the growth of managed care and decreasing influence by managed care
organizations on the ordering of clinical laboratory testing by physicians has
contributed to renewed growth in testing volumes and further improvements in
profitability since 1999

     we believe that during the next several years the industry will continue
to experience revenue growth of approximately 5 per year and in the longer
term we expect industry revenue growth to increase as much as 7 per year due
to the following factors

     o    general expansion and aging of the united states population

     o    increasing focus on early detection and prevention as a means to
          reduce the overall cost of healthcare and development of more
          sophisticated and specialized tests for early detection of disease and
          disease management

     o    continuing research and development in the area of genomics and
          proteomics which is expected to yield new genetic tests and
          techniques

     o    increasing volume of tests for diagnosis and monitoring of infectious
          diseases such as aids and hepatitis c

     o    increasing affordability of tests due to advances in technology and
          cost efficiencies and

     o    increasing awareness by consumers of the value of clinical laboratory
          testing and increasing willingness of consumers to pay for tests that
          may not be covered by third party payers

business strategy

     our mission is to be recognized by our customers and employees as the best
provider of comprehensive and innovative diagnostic testing information and
related services the principal components of this strategy are to

     o    capitalize on our leading position within the laboratory testing
          market we are the leader in our core clinical laboratory testing
          business offering the broadest national access to clinical laboratory
          testing services with facilities in substantially all of the major
          metropolitan areas in the united states we currently operate a
          nationwide network of approximately 1700 patient service centers
          principal laboratories located in more than 30 major metropolitan
          areas throughout the united states and about 140 smaller rapid
          response laboratories that enable us to serve physicians managed
          care organizations hospitals employers and other healthcare
          providers and their patients throughout the united states we believe
          that customers will increasingly seek to utilize laboratory testing
          companies that have a nationwide presence and offer a comprehensive
          range of services and that as a result we will be able to profitably
          enhance our market position

     o    compete through providing the highest quality services we intend to
          become recognized as the quality leader in the healthcare services
          industry we are implementing a six sigma initiative throughout our
          organization six sigma is a management approach that requires a
          thorough understanding of customer needs and requirements process
          discipline rigorous tracking and measuring of services and training
          of employees in methodologies so that they can be held accountable for
          improving results during the second half of 2001 we began to
          integrate our six sigma initiative with our initiative to standardize
          operations and processes across all of quest diagnostics by adopting
          identified company best practices we plan to continue these
          initiatives during the next several years and expect that successful
          implementation of these initiatives will result in measurable
          improvements in customer satisfaction as well as significant economic
          benefits the quest diagnostics nichols institute was the first
          clinical laboratory in north america to achieve iso9001
          certification two of our clinical trials laboratories and our
          diagnostic kits facility have also achieved iso9001 certification in
          addition five of our laboratories including a forensic toxicology
          laboratory have achieved iso9002 certification these certifications
          are international standards for quality management systems

     o    continue to lead innovation we intend to build upon our reputation as
          a leading innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing
          to introduce new tests technology and services as the industry
          leader with the largest and broadest network and the leading provider
          of esoteric testing including genebased testing we believe that we
          are the best channel for developers of new technology and tests to
          introduce their products to the marketplace through our relationship
          with members of the academic community and pharmaceutical and
          biotechnology firms as well as our collaboration with emerging
          medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel
          diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we believe that
          we are one of the leaders in transferring technical innovation to the
          market

          during 2002 through our research and development marketing and
          commercial alliance with roche diagnostics we were the first
          laboratory to offer several new tests of roche including its elecsys
          ntprobnp test which aids in the diagnostics of congestive heart
          failure we entered into a relationship with celera diagnostics that
          gives us access to potentially significant markers for the risk of
          cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death in the united
          states and diabetes we also established a relationship with
          correlogic systems and gained access to its new ovarian cancer blood
          test which we expect will be available to the marketplace later in
          2003

          in addition we continue to introduce new tests that we develop at
          nichols institute one of the leading esoteric testing laboratories in
          the world and the largest provider of molecular diagnostics testing in
          the united states during 2002 we developed and introduced a new test
          called cf completetm for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in high
          risk patients the cf completetm test is the only test that
          sequences the entire cf gene and its 1000 mutations we are expanding
          dna based testing in the clinical laboratory to provide enhanced
          sensitivity accuracy and reliability of this next generation
          technology

          we believe that with the unveiling of the human genome new genes and
          the linkages of genes with disease will continue to be discovered at
          an accelerating pace leading to research that will result in ever
          more complex and thorough predictive diagnostic and therapeutic
          testing we believe that we are well positioned to capture much of
          this growth

          we continue to invest in the development and improvement of our
          connectivity products for customers and providers by developing
          differentiated products that will provide friendlier easier access to
          ordering and resulting of laboratory tests and patientcentric
          information in february 2003 we launched our emaxxtm internet
          portal to physicians nationwide which enables doctors to order
          diagnostic tests and review laboratory results online as well as
          check patients insurance eligibility in real time and view clinical
          information from many sources

     o    pursue strategic growth opportunities we intend to continue to
          leverage our network in order to capitalize on targeted strategic
          growth opportunities both inside and outside our core clinical
          laboratory testing business these opportunities are more fully
          described under strategic growth opportunities and include expanding
          our genebased and specialty testing capabilities expanding our
          geographic presence across the united states and continuing to make
          selective acquisitions and developing connectivity products for
          customers and providers

     o    leverage our satisfaction model our approach to conducting business
          states that satisfied employees lead to satisfied customers which in
          turn benefits our stockholders we regularly survey our employees and
          customers and follow up on their concerns we emphasize skills
          training for all employees and leadership training for our supervisory
          employees which also includes six sigma training to manage
          highimpact quality improvement projects throughout our organization
          and annual compliance training we are committed to engaging each
          employee with dignity and respect and trust them to treat our
          customers the same way we believe that our treatment and training of
          employees together with our competitive pay and benefits helps
          increase employee satisfaction and performance thereby enabling us to
          provide better services to our customers

recent acquisitions

     on february 26 2003 we accepted for payment more than 99 of the
outstanding capital stock of unilab corporation or unilab the leading
independent clinical laboratory in california on february 28 2003 we acquired
the remaining shares of unilab through a merger in connection with the
acquisition we issued approximately 74 million shares of quest diagnostics
common stock including 03 million shares of quest diagnostics common stock
reserved for outstanding stock options of unilab which were converted upon the
completion of the acquisition into options to acquire shares of quest
diagnostics common stock paid 297 million in cash and we plan to repay
substantially all of unilabs outstanding indebtedness unilab which generated
net revenues of approximately 425 million in 2002 has three regional
laboratories approximately 365 patient service centers and 35 rapid response
laboratories and approximately 4100 employees we expect to incur up to 20
million of costs during 2003 and 2004 to integrate unilab and our existing
california operations upon completion of the unilab integration we expect to
realize approximately 25 million to 30 million of annual synergies we expect
to achieve this annual rate of synergies by the end of 2005

     in connection with the acquisition of unilab as part of a settlement
agreement with the united states federal trade commission we entered into an
agreement to sell to laboratory corporation of america holdings inc or
labcorp certain assets in northern california including the assignment of
agreements with four independent physician associations ipa and leases for
46 patient service centers five of which also serve as rapid response
laboratories for 45 million approximately 27 million in annual net revenues
are generated by capitated fees under the ipa contracts and associated
feeforservice testing for physicians whose patients use these patient service
centers as well as from specimens received directly from the ipa physicians

     on april 1 2002 we acquired american medical laboratories incorporated
or aml and an affiliated company of aml labportal inc a provider of
electronic connectivity products in an allcash transaction valued at
approximately 500 million which included the assumption of approximately 160
million in debt aml is a national provider of esoteric testing to hospitals and
specialty physicians and is a leading provider of diagnostics testing services
in the nevada and metropolitan washington dc markets the companys
chantilly virginia laboratory acquired as part of the aml acquisition has
become the primary esoteric testing laboratory and hospital service center for
the eastern united states and will complement our nichols institute esoteric
testing facility in san juan capistrano california esoteric testing volumes
will be redirected within our national network to provide customers with
improved turnaround time and customer service certain routine clinical
laboratory testing currently performed in the chantilly virginia laboratory
will transition over time to other testing facilities within our regional
laboratory network during 2002 we repaid all of the 475 million in
indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition

     following an acquisition the integration process requires the dedication
of significant management resources which could result in a loss of momentum in
the activities of our business and may cause an interruption of or
deterioration in our services since most of our clinical laboratory testing is
performed under arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice any
interruption of or deterioration in our services may also result in a
customers decision to stop using us for clinical laboratory testing these
events could have a material adverse impact on our business however management
believes that the successful implementation of our integration plans and our
value proposition based on expanded patient access our broad testing
capabilities and most importantly the quality of the services we provide will
mitigate customer attrition

our services

     our laboratory testing business consists of routine testing esoteric
testing and clinical trials testing routine testing generates approximately
83 of our net revenues esoteric and genebased testing generates approximately
13 of our net revenues and clinical trials testing generates less than 3 of
our net revenues we derive less than 2 of our net revenues from foreign
operations


                                       4

routine testing

     routine tests measure various important bodily health parameters such as
the functions of the kidney heart liver thyroid and other organs commonly
ordered tests include

     o    blood cholesterol level tests

     o    complete blood cell counts

     o    pap smears

     o    hivrelated tests

     o    urinalyses

     o    pregnancy and other prenatal tests and

     o    alcohol and other substanceabuse tests

     we perform routine testing through our network of major laboratories rapid
response laboratories or stat labs and patient service centers we also
perform routine testing at the hospital laboratories we manage major
laboratories offer a full line of routine clinical tests rapid response
laboratories are local facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated
line of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround patient
service centers are facilities where specimens are collected these centers are
typically located in or near a building used by medical professionals

     we operate 24 hours a day 365 days a year we perform and report most
routine procedures within 24 hours most test results are delivered
electronically

esoteric testing

     esoteric tests are those tests that are performed less frequently than
routine tests and require more sophisticated technology equipment and
materials professional handson attention and more highly skilled
professional and technical personnel because it is not costeffective for most
clinical laboratories to perform the low volume of esoteric tests inhouse they
generally refer many esoteric tests to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory
due to their complexity esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher
levels than routine tests

     our quest diagnostics nichols institute is one of the leading esoteric
clinical testing laboratories in the world in 1998 nichols institute located
in san juan capistrano california became the first clinical laboratory in
north america to achieve iso9001 certification our esoteric testing laboratory
in chantilly virginia acquired as part of the aml acquisition now enables us
to provide full esoteric testing services including genebased testing on the
east coast our two esoteric testing laboratories which conduct business as
quest diagnostics nichols institute perform hundreds of esoteric tests that are
not routinely performed by our regional laboratories these esoteric tests are
generally in the following fields

     o    endocrinology the study of glands their hormone secretions and their
          effects on body growth and metabolism

     o    genetics the study of chromosomes genes and their protein products
          and effects

     o    immunology the study of the immune system including antibodies
          immune system cells and their effects

     o    microbiology the study of microscopic forms of life including
          bacteria viruses fungi and other infectious agents

     o    oncology the study of abnormal cell growth including benign tumors
          and cancer

     o    serology a science dealing with the body fluids and their analysis
          including antibodies proteins and other characteristics


                                       5

     o    special chemistry more sophisticated testing requiring special
          expertise and technology and

     o    toxicology the study of chemicals and drugs and their effects on the
          bodys metabolism

     through our relationship with members of the academic community and
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms as well as our collaboration with
emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel
diagnostics pharmaceutical and device technologies we believe that we are one
of the leaders in transferring technical innovation to the market for example
through our relationships with roche diagnostics celera diagnostics and
correlogic systems we have either introduced or gained access to new innovative
tests that help provide insights to detect treat and monitor various diseases
and disorders in addition nichols institute continues to introduce new tests
such as the cf completetm test the most comprehensive genetic test available
to sequence cystic fibrosis gene mutations see business strategy  continue to
lead innovation

     through our academic associates program leading academics and
biotechnology firms work directly with our staff scientists to monitor and
consult on existing test procedures and develop new esoteric test methods in
addition we have entered into licensing arrangements and codevelopment
agreements with biotechnology companies and academic medical centers see
business strategycontinue to lead innovation

clinical trials testing

     we believe that we are the second largest provider of clinical laboratory
testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs in
the world clinical research trials are required by the food and drug
administration or fda to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs we have
clinical trials testing centers in the united states and in england we also
provide clinical trials testing in australia singapore and south africa
through arrangements with third parties clinical trials involving new drugs are
increasingly being performed both inside and outside the united states
approximately 40 of our net revenues from clinical trials testing in 2002
represented testing for glaxosmithkline plc gsk we currently have a
longterm contractual relationship with gsk under which we are the primary
provider of testing to support gsks clinical trials testing requirements
worldwide

other services and products

     we manufacture and market diagnostic test kits and systems primarily for
esoteric testing under the nichols institute diagnostics brand name these are
sold principally to hospitals and clinical laboratories both domestically and
internationally our medplus subsidiary is a developer and integrator for
clinical connectivity and data management solutions for healthcare organizations
and clinicians primarily through its chartmaxxtm electronic medical record
system and provides workflow and content management solutions to customers in a
variety of industries recently quest diagnostics has begun deploying
emaxxtm a new stateoftheart physicians internet portal across the united
states the internet portal was developed in conjunction with medplus and will
give physicians greater access to laboratory testing and other clinical
information online

payers and customers

     we provide testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers we
consider a payer as the party that pays for the test depending on the billing
arrangement and applicable law the payer may be 1 the physician or other
party such as another laboratory or an employer who referred the testing to
us 2 the patient or 3 a third party who pays the bill for the patient
such as an insurance company medicare or medicaid some states including new
york new jersey and rhode island prohibit us from billing physician clients
we generally consider a customer to be the party who refers tests to us we
also consider a managed care organization as both our customer and a payer when
it contracts with us on an exclusive or semiexclusive basis on behalf of its
patients

     during 2002 only two customers accounted for more than 5 of our net
revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 7 of our net revenues
we believe that the loss of any one of our customers would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow


                                       6

payers

     the following table shows current estimates of the breakdown of the
percentage of our total volume of requisitions and total clinical laboratory
revenues during 2002 applicable to each payer group

                                                                  revenue

customers

physicians

     physicians requiring testing for patients are the primary source of our
clinical laboratory testing volume we typically bill physician accounts on a
feeforservice basis fees billed to physicians are based on the laboratorys
client fee schedule and are typically negotiated fees billed to patients and
insurance companies are based on the laboratorys patient fee schedule subject
to any limitations on fees negotiated with the insurance companies or with
physicians on behalf of their patients medicare and medicaid reimbursements are
based on fee schedules set by governmental authorities

managed care organizations and other insurance providers

     managed care organizations and other insurance providers which typically
contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories for their members
represent approximately one half of our total testing volumes and one half of
our net revenues larger managed care organizations and other insurance
providers typically prefer to use large independent clinical laboratories
because they can provide services on a national or regional basis and can manage
networks of local or regional laboratories in addition larger laboratories are
better able to achieve the lowcost structures necessary to profitably service
large managed care organizations and can provide test utilization data across
their various plans in certain markets such as california managed care
organizations may delegate their covered members to independent physician
associations which in turn contract with laboratories for clinical laboratory
services

     while the growth in the number of patients participating in managed care
plans has slowed in recent years over the last decade the managed care
industry has been consolidating resulting in fewer but larger managed care
organizations with significant bargaining power in negotiating fee arrangements
with healthcare providers including clinical laboratories managed care
organizations demand that clinical laboratory service providers accept
discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk
associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated
payment contracts under capitated payment contracts clinical laboratories
receive a fixed monthly fee per individual enrolled with the managed care
organization for all laboratory tests performed during the month regardless of
the number or cost of the tests actually performed some services such as
various esoteric tests new technologies and anatomic pathology services may be
carved out from a capitated rate and if carved out are charged on a
feeforservice basis

     in the last several years there has been a shift in the way major managed
care organizations contract with clinical laboratories managed care
organizations have begun to offer more freedom of choice to their affiliated
physicians including greater freedom to determine which laboratory to use and
which tests to order accordingly most of our agreements with major managed
care organizations are nonexclusive contracts as a result under these
nonexclusive arrangements physicians have more freedom of choice in selecting
laboratories and laboratories are likely to compete more on the basis of
service and quality rather than price alone also managed care organizations
have been giving patients greater freedom of choice and patients have
increasingly been selecting plans such as preferred provider organizations
that offer a greater choice of providers pricing for these preferred provider
organizations is typically negotiated on a feeforservice basis which
generally results in higher revenue per requisition than under a capitated fee
arrangement despite these trends managed care organizations continue to
aggressively seek cost reductions in order to


                                       7





page

keep their premiums to their customers competitive if we are unable to agree on
pricing with a managed care organization we would become a nonparticipating
provider and could then only bill the ordering physician or the patient rather
than the managed care organization this nonparticipating status could lead
to loss of business since the physician is likely to refer testing to a
participating provider whose testing is covered by the patients managed care
benefit plan we cannot assure investors that we will continue to be successful
in negotiating contracts with major managed care organizations loss of multiple
major managed care agreements could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition results of operations and cash flow

     quest diagnostics offers questnettm an innovative product to develop and
manage a customized network of clinical laboratory providers for managed care
organizations through questnettm physicians and members are provided
multiple choices for clinical laboratory testing while managed care
organizations realize cost reductions under a single capitated arrangement

hospitals

     we provide services to hospitals throughout the united states that vary
from esoteric testing to helping manage their laboratories we believe that we
are the industrys market leader in servicing hospitals testing for hospitals
accounts for approximately 12 of our net revenues hospitals generally maintain
an onsite laboratory to perform testing on patients and refer less frequently
needed and highly specialized procedures to outside laboratories which
typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated feeforservice basis we believe
that most hospital laboratories perform approximately 90 to 95 of their
patients clinical laboratory tests in addition many hospitals compete with
independent clinical laboratories for outreach nonhospital patients testing
most physicians have admitting privileges or other relationships with hospitals
as part of their medical practice many hospitals leverage their relationships
with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach
testing to the hospitals laboratory in addition hospitals that own physician
practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospitals
affiliated laboratory as a result hospitalaffiliated laboratories can be both
customers and competitors for independent clinical laboratories

     during 2002 in conjunction with the acquisition of aml we launched
dedicated sales and service teams focused on serving the unique needs of
hospital customers we believe that the combination of fullservice bicoastal
esoteric testing capabilities medical and scientific professionals for
consultation innovative connectivity products focus on six sigma quality and
dedicated sales and service professionals positions us to be the partner of
choice for hospital customers

     we have joint venture arrangements with leading integrated health delivery
networks in several metropolitan areas these joint venture arrangements which
provide testing for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians
and other healthcare providers in their geographic areas serve as our principal
laboratory facilities in their service areas typically we have either a
majority ownership interest in or daytoday management responsibilities for
our hospital joint venture relationships we also manage the laboratories at a
number of other hospitals

employers governmental institutions and other clinical laboratories

     we provide testing services to governmental agencies including the
department of defense and state and federal prison systems and to large
employers we believe that we are the leading provider of clinical laboratory
testing to employers for substance abuse occupational exposures and
comprehensive wellness programs wellness programs enable employers to take an
active role in lowering their overall healthcare costs testing services for
employers account for approximately 4 of our net revenues the volume of
testing services for employers which generally have relatively low profit
margins declined significantly during 2001 and 2002 driven by a general
slowing of the economy and a corresponding slowdown in hiring we also perform
esoteric testing services for other independent clinical laboratories that do
not have the full range of our testing capabilities all of these customers are
charged on a feeforservice basis

consumers

     consumers are becoming increasingly interested in managing their own health
and health records currently almost all the testing we perform is ordered
directly by a physician who then receives the test results however over time
we believe that consumers will increasingly want to order clinical laboratory
tests themselves


                                       8

sales and marketing

     we market to and service our customers through our direct sales force sales
representatives customer service and patient service representatives and
couriers

     we focus our sales efforts on pursuing and keeping profitable accounts that
generate an acceptable return we have an active account management process to
evaluate the profitability of all of our accounts where appropriate we change
the service levels terminate accounts that are not profitable or adjust
pricing

     most sales representatives market routine laboratory services primarily to
physicians some sales representatives focus on particular market segments or on
testing niches for example some representatives concentrate on market segments
such as managed care organizations and others concentrate on testing niches such
as substanceabuse testing during 2001 we created a team of sales
representatives who concentrate on genebased and other esoteric testing during
2002 following our acquisition of aml we created a team of sales
representatives who are dedicated to sales to hospital clients and we increased
the number of sales representatives who concentrate on genebased testing

     customer service representatives perform a number of services for patients
and customers they monitor services answer questions and help resolve
problems our couriers pick up specimens from most clients daily

strategic growth opportunities

     in addition to expanding our core clinical laboratory business through
internal growth and pursuing our strategy to become a leading provider of
medical information we intend to continue to leverage our network in order to
capitalize on targeted growth opportunities both inside and outside our core
laboratory testing business

     o    genebased and other esoteric tests we intend to remain a leading
          innovator in the clinical laboratory industry by continuing to
          introduce new tests technology and services we estimate that the
          current united states market in esoteric testing including genebased
          testing is 3 billion to 4 billion per year we believe that we have
          the largest genebased testing business in the united states with
          approximately 400 million in annual net revenues and that this
          business is growing by more than 20 per year we believe that the
          unveiling of the human genome the discovery of new genes and the
          linkages of these genes with disease will result in more complex and
          thorough predictive diagnostic and therapeutic testing we believe
          that we are well positioned to realize this growth we intend to focus
          on commercializing diagnostic applications of discoveries in the areas
          of functional genomics the analysis of genes and their functions
          and proteomics the discovery of new proteins made possible by the
          human genome project

     o    anatomic pathology while we are one of the leading providers of
          anatomic pathology services in the united states we have
          traditionally been strongest in cytology and specifically in the
          analysis of pap smears to detect cervical cancer during the last
          several years we have led the industry in converting approximately
          80 of our pap smear business to the use of monolayer technology for
          cervical cancer screening a higher quality and more profitable
          product offering we intend to continue to expand our anatomic
          pathology business into higher growth segments including histology
          tissue pathology we estimate that the current united states market
          for anatomic pathology services is approximately 6 billion per year
          we estimate that cytology represents about 1 billion per year of this
          market and that tissue pathology represents about 5 billion per year
          of this market we generate approximately 400 million in net revenues
          from such services each year

     o    selective regional acquisitions the clinical laboratory industry
          remains highly fragmented we expect to continue to acquire other
          regional clinical laboratories that can be integrated with our
          existing laboratories thereby enabling us to reduce costs and improve
          efficiencies through the elimination of redundant facilities and
          equipment and reductions in personnel see recent acquisitions for
          a discussion of our recent acquisitions we may also consider
          acquisitions of ancillary businesses as part of our overall growth
          strategy such as our november 2001 acquisition of medplus inc which
          develops clinical connectivity products designed to enhance patient
          care see connectivity solutions

page

     o    connectivity solutions we continue to invest in the development and
          improvement of connectivity products for customers and providers by
          developing differentiated products that will provide friendlier
          easier access to ordering and resulting of laboratory tests and
          patientcentric information in february 2003 we launched our
          emaxxtm internet portal to physicians nationwide the emaxxtm
          internet portal helps doctors order diagnostic tests and review
          laboratory results online as well as check patients insurance
          eligibility in real time and view clinical information from many
          sources the emaxxtm internet portal is the gateway that physicians
          can now use to access our internetbased test orders and results
          online service which is experiencing acceptance in the marketplace
          today this service will allow us to replace older technology desktop
          products that we currently provide to many physicians and thereby
          streamline our support structure demand has been growing for our
          electronic connectivity solutions as physician offices have expanded
          their usage of the internet by the end of 2002 we were receiving
          approximately 10 of all test orders and delivering about 15 of all
          test results via our secure online service

          the emaxxtm internet portal was developed in conjunction with
          medplus which we acquired in november 2001 medplus chartmaxxtm
          and e maxxtm patient record systems are designed to support the
          creation and management of electronic patient records by bringing
          together in one patientcentric view information from various sources
          including the physicians records and laboratory and hospital data we
          intend to expand the services offered through our portal over time as
          other strategic arrangements are realized which will enhance our
          ability to introduce a broad range of electronic services to
          healthcare providers

information systems

     information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our
business including laboratory testing billing customer service logistics
and management of medical data our success depends in part on the continued
and uninterrupted performance of our information technology it systems
computer systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including
telecommunications or network failures malicious human acts and natural
disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers are
potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and
similar disruptive problems we have taken precautionary measures to prevent
unanticipated problems that could affect our systems sustained or repeated
system failures that interrupt our ability to process test orders deliver test
results or perform tests in a timely manner could adversely affect our
reputation and result in a loss of customers and net revenues

     during the 1980s and early 1990s when we acquired many of our laboratory
facilities our regional laboratories were operated as local decentralized
units and we did not standardize their billing laboratory and some of their
other information systems as a result by the end of 1995 we had many different
information systems for billing test results reporting and other transactions
over time the growth in the size and network of our customers and the
increasing complexity of billing demonstrated a greater need for standardized
systems

     during 2002 we began implementation of a standard laboratory information
system and a standard billing system we expect that deployment of the
standardized systems will take several years to complete and will result in
significantly more centralized systems than we have today we expect the
integration of these systems will improve operating efficiency and provide
management with more timely and comprehensive information with which to make
management decisions however failure to properly implement this
standardization process could materially adversely impact us during system
conversions of this type workflow may be reengineered to take advantage of
enhanced system capabilities which may cause temporary disruptions in service
in addition the implementation process including the transfer of databases and
master files to new data centers presents significant conversion risks which
need to be managed carefully

billing

     billing for laboratory services is complicated laboratories must bill
various payers such as patients insurance companies medicare medicaid
doctors and employer groups all of which have different requirements
additionally auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as
well as internal compliance policies and procedures add further complexity to
the billing process among many other factors complicating billing are

     o    pricing differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement
          rates of the payers

     o    disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for payment and


                                       10





page

     o    disparity in coverage and information requirements among various
          payers

     we incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation in
medicare and medicaid programs as billing and reimbursement for clinical
laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal and state
regulations these additional costs include those related to 1 complexity
added to our billing processes 2 training and education of our employees and
customers 3 compliance and legal costs and 4 costs related to among other
factors medical necessity denials and advanced beneficiary notices compliance
with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies
and procedures adds further complexity and costs to the billing process
changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our
clients the center for medicare and medicaid services or cms formerly the
health care financing administration establishes procedures and continuously
evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process

     we believe that most of our bad debt expense which was 53 of our net
revenues in 2002 is primarily the result of missing or incorrect billing
information on requisitions received from healthcare providers rather than
credit related issues in general we perform the requested tests and report
test results regardless of whether the billing information is incorrect or
missing we subsequently attempt to contact the provider to obtain any missing
information and rectify incorrect billing information missing or incorrect
information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process
creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of
accounts receivable when all issues relating to the missing or incorrect
information are not resolved in a timely manner the related receivables are
writtenoff to the allowance for doubtful accounts

     we have implemented best practices for billing that have significantly
reduced the percentage of requisitions with missing billing information from
approximately 16 at the beginning of 1996 to approximately 5 in 2002 these
initiatives together with our six sigma and standardization initiatives and
progress in dealing with medicare medical necessity documentation requirements
have significantly reduced bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues from
about 7 during 1996 to 53 during 2002 we believe that in the longer term
with a continuing focus on process discipline bad debt as a percentage of net
revenues can be reduced to 4 or less see regulation of reimbursement for
clinical laboratory services

competition

     the clinical laboratory testing business remains fragmented and highly
competitive we compete with three types of providers hospitalaffiliated
laboratories other independent clinical laboratories and physicianoffice
laboratories we are the leading clinical laboratory provider in the united
states with net revenues of 41 billion during 2002 and facilities in
substantially all of the countrys major metropolitan areas our largest
competitor is labcorp in addition we compete with and service many smaller
regional and local independent clinical laboratories as well as laboratories
owned by physicians and hospitals see payers and customers  customers

     we believe that healthcare providers consider a number of factors when
selecting a laboratory including

     o    service capability and quality

     o    accuracy timeliness and consistency in reporting test results

     o    number and type of tests performed by the laboratory

     o    number convenience and geographic coverage of patient service
          centers

     o    reputation in the medical community and

     o    pricing

     we believe that we compete favorably in each of these areas

     we believe that large independent clinical laboratories may be able to
increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to
their large service networks and lower cost structures these advantages should
enable larger clinical laboratories to more effectively serve large customers
including managed care organizations in addition we believe that consolidation
in the clinical laboratory testing business will continue however a majority
of the clinical laboratory testing is likely to continue to be performed by
hospitals which generally have affiliations with community

physicians that refer testing to us see payers and customers  customers 
hospitals as a result of these affiliations we compete against
hospitalaffiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability
and quality as well as other nonpricing factors our failure to provide service
superior to hospitalaffiliated laboratories and other laboratories could
negatively impact our net revenues

     advances in technology may lead to the development of more costeffective
tests that can be performed outside of an independent clinical laboratory such
as 1 pointofcare tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices
and 2 home testing that can be performed by patients or by physicians in their
offices development of such technology and its use by our customers would
reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our
revenues see regulation of clinical laboratory operations

quality assurance

     our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection storage
and transportation of patient specimens as well as the precision and accuracy
of analysis and result reporting our quality assurance efforts focus on
proficiency testing process audits statistical process control and personnel
training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers we are
implementing the six sigma approach to help achieve our goal of becoming
recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the healthcare services industry

     internal proficiency testing quality control and audits quality control
samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens the
results of tests on quality control samples are then monitored to identify
trends biases or imprecision in the analytical processes in addition we
administer an internal proficiency testing program where proficiency testing
samples are processed through our systems the same way as are routine patient
specimens we also perform internal process audits as part of our comprehensive
quality assurance program

     external proficiency testing and accreditation all our laboratories
participate in various quality surveillance programs conducted externally they
include proficiency testing programs administered by the college of american
pathologists or cap as well as some state agencies

     cap is an independent nongovernmental organization of board certified
pathologists cap is approved by the cms to inspect clinical laboratories to
determine compliance with the standards required by the clinical laboratory
improvement amendments of 1988 or clia cap offers an accreditation program
to which laboratories may voluntarily subscribe all of our major regional
laboratories are accredited by the cap accreditation includes onsite
inspections and participation in the cap or equivalent proficiency testing
program

regulation of clinical laboratory operations

     the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant federal and
state regulation including inspections and audits by governmental agencies
governmental authorities may impose fines or criminal penalties or take other
enforcement actions to enforce laws and regulations including revoking a
clinical laboratorys right to conduct business changes in regulation may
increase the costs of performing clinical laboratory tests or increase the
administrative requirements of claims

     clia and state regulation all of our laboratories and patient service
centers are licensed and accredited by applicable federal and state agencies
clia regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be
certified by the federal government to ensure that all clinical laboratory
testing services are uniformly accurate reliable and timely clia permits
states to adopt regulations that are more stringent than federal law for
example state laws may require additional personnel qualifications quality
control record maintenance and proficiency testing currently most of our
clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity
and therefore subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia the cost
of compliance with clia makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to
operate clinical laboratories in their offices however manufacturers of
laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by
marketing pointofcare laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling
test kits approved for home use to both physicians and patients diagnostic
tests approved or cleared by the fda for home use are automatically deemed to
be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office
laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight as well as by patients in
their homes

     drug testing the substance abuse and mental health services
administration or samhsa regulates drug testing for public sector employees
and employees of certain federally regulated businesses samhsa has established
detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to
perform drug testing on federal employees and contractors and other regulated
entities all laboratories that perform such testing must be certified as
meeting samhsa standards

     medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials clinical
laboratories are also subject to federal state and local regulations relating
to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste hazardous waste and
radioactive materials we generally use outside vendors to dispose of specimens

     fda the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments test kits
reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken
responsibility from the centers for disease control and prevention or cdc for
test classification in the past the fda has claimed regulatory authority over
laboratorydeveloped tests but has exercised enforcement discretion in not
regulating tests performed by cliacertified laboratories in december 2000 the
department of health and human services or hhs secretarys advisory committee
on genetic testing recommended that the fda regulate laboratory developed
genetic testing in late 2002 a new hhs secretarys advisory committee on
genetics health and society was appointed to replace the prior advisory
committee but it has not yet met or made any recommendations in the meantime
the fda continues to consider whether to regulate laboratory developed genetic
testing representatives of clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics
and the american clinical laboratory association the industrys trade
association have met with two branches of the fda to address their respective
issues pertaining to regulation of genetic testing in general and issues with
regard to premarket approval of the analyte specific reagents used in
laboratorydeveloped hiv genotype tests in particular we expect those
discussions to continue fda regulation of laboratorydeveloped genetic testing
could lead to increased costs and delay in introducing new genetic tests

     occupational safety the federal occupational safety and health
administration or osha has established extensive requirements relating
specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers this includes
protecting workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and
hepatitis b and c and requiring employers to develop a program to reduce or
eliminate needle stick injuries such as through the use of safety needles

     specimen transportation transportation of infectious substances such as
clinical laboratory specimens is subject to regulation by the department of
transportation the public health service the united states postal service
and the international civil aviation organization

     corporate practice of medicine many states including several in which our
principal laboratories are located prohibit corporations from engaging in the
practice of medicine the corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been
interpreted to prohibit corporations from employing licensed healthcare
professionals to provide services on the corporations behalf these
restrictions may affect our ability to provide services directly to consumers

privacy and security of health information standard transactions

     pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of
1996 or hipaa on december 28 2000 the secretary of hhs issued final
regulations that would establish comprehensive federal privacy standards with
respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health
plans healthcare providers or healthcare data clearinghouses the regulations
establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects including

     o    the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health
          information are permitted or required without a specific authorization
          by the patient

     o    a patients rights to access amend and receive an accounting of the
          disclosures and uses of protected health information

     o    the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health
          information and

     o    administrative technical and physical safeguards required of entities
          that use or receive protected health information

     the federal healthcare privacy regulations establish a floor and do not
supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to
comply with both federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws in
addition for healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries
we will need to comply with the laws of other countries the federal privacy
regulations became effective in april 2001 for healthcare providers who have
until april 2003 to comply in march 2002 hhs issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking to modify the final privacy standards and a final rule modifying the
privacy standards was published on august 14 2002 in addition final standards
for electronic transactions were issued in august 2000 and became effective in
october 2002 although covered entities were eligible to obtain a one year
extension if approved through an application to the secretary of hhs that
includes a plan for achieving compliance by october 16 2003 we received from
hhs a oneyear extension through october 16 2003 the regulation on electronic
transactions provide uniform standards for code sets billing codes representing
medical procedures such as laboratory tests and diagnosis codes which are
used among others in connection with the identification and billing of medical
procedures and laboratory tests electronic claims remittance advice
enrollment eligibility and other electronic transactions finally the security
and electronic signature regulations were published on february 20 2003 and
will become effective on april 21 2003 although healthcare providers have
until april 21 2005 to comply hipaa provides for significant fines and other
penalties for wrongful disclosure of protected health information we have
completed our analyses and are engaged in finalizing our standard operating
procedures and policies for implementation in 2003 compliance with the hipaa
requirements when finalized will require significant capital and personnel
resources from all healthcare organizations including quest diagnostics these
regulations when effective will likely restrict our ability to use our
laboratory database to provide medical information for purposes other than
payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for
disclosures for various public policy purposes outlined in the final privacy
standards and information that does not specifically identify a patient

regulation of reimbursement for clinical laboratory services

     overview the healthcare industry has experienced significant changes in
reimbursement practices during the past several years governmental payers such
as medicare which principally serves patients 65 years and older and medicaid
which principally serves indigent patients as well as private insurers and
large employers have taken steps to control the cost utilization and delivery
of healthcare services principally as a result of reimbursement reductions and
measures adopted by cms to reduce utilization described below the percentage of
our aggregate net revenues derived from medicare and medicaid programs declined
from approximately 20 in 1995 to approximately 15 in 2002 while the total
cost to comply with medicare administrative requirements is disproportionate to
our cost to bill other payers average medicare reimbursement rates approximate
the companys overall average reimbursement rate from all payers making this
business generally less profitable however we believe that our other business
may significantly depend on continued participation in the medicare and medicaid
programs because many customers may want a single laboratory to perform all of
their clinical laboratory testing services regardless of whether reimbursements
are ultimately made by themselves medicare medicaid or other payers

     billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to
significant and complex federal and state regulation penalties for violations
of laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs and for violations of
federal fraud and abuse laws include 1 exclusion from participation in
medicaremedicaid programs 2 asset forfeitures 3 civil and criminal
penalties and fines and 4 the loss of various licenses certificates and
authorizations necessary to operate some or all of a clinical laboratorys
business civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations are not more
than 10000 per violation plus three times the amount claimed and in the case
of kickback violations not more than 50000 per violation plus up to three
times the amount of remuneration involved a parallel civil remedy under the
federal false claims act provides for damages not more than 11000 per
violation plus up to three times the amount claimed

     reduced reimbursements in 1984 congress established a medicare fee
schedule payment methodology for clinical laboratory services performed for
patients covered under part b of the medicare program congress then imposed a
national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local
medicare fee schedules since then congress has periodically reduced the
national ceilings the medicare national fee schedule limitations were reduced
in 1996 to 76 of the 1984 national median of the local fee schedules and in
1998 to 74 of the 1984 national median the balanced budget act of 1997
eliminated the provision for annual fee schedule increases based on the consumer
price index from 1998 through 2002 however a 11 increase based on the
consumer price index became effective on january 1 2003 the limitation amount
for new clinical laboratory tests as determined by the secretary of hhs for
which no limitation amount has previously been established is 100 of the
median of all the fee schedules established for that test

     pathology services are reimbursed by medicare based on a resourcebased
relative value scale rbrvs that is periodically updated by cms less than 1
of our aggregate net revenues are derived from pathology services reimbursed by
medicare based on rbrvs

     laboratories must bill the medicare program directly and must accept the
carriers fee schedule amount as payment in full for most tests performed on
behalf of medicare beneficiaries in addition state medicaid programs are
prohibited from paying more and in most instances pay significantly less than
medicare major clinical laboratories including quest diagnostics typically
use two fee schedules

     o    client fees charged to physicians hospitals and institutions to
          which a laboratory supplies services on a wholesale basis and which
          are billed on a monthly basis these fees are generally subject to
          negotiation or discount

     o    patient fees charged to individual patients and thirdparty payers
          like medicare and medicaid these generally require separate bills for
          each requisition

     the fee schedule amounts established by medicare are typically
substantially lower than patient fees otherwise charged by us but are sometimes
higher than our fees actually charged to certain other clients during 1992 the
office of the inspector general or oig of the hhs issued final regulations
that prohibited charging medicare fees substantially in excess of a providers
usual charges the oig however declined to provide any guidance concerning
interpretation of these rules including whether or not discounts to
nongovernmental clients and payers or the dualfee structure might be
inconsistent with these rules

     a proposed rule released in september 1997 would have authorized the oig to
exclude providers from participation in the medicare program including clinical
laboratories that charge medicare and other programs fees that are
substantially in excess of    usual charges    to any of their
customers clients or patients this proposal was withdrawn by the oig in 1998
in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion which indicated that a
clinical laboratory offering discounts on client bills may violate the usual
charges regulation if the charge to medicare substantially exceeds the amount
the laboratory most frequently charges or has contractually agreed to accept
from nonfederal payers the oig subsequently issued a letter clarifying that
the usual charges regulation is not a blanket prohibition on discounts to
private pay customers

     the 1997 balanced budget act permits cms to adjust statutorily prescribed
fees for some medical services including clinical laboratory services if the
fees are grossly excessive in december 2002 cms issued an interim final rule
setting forth a process and factors for establishing a realistic and equitable
payment amount for all medicare part b services except physician services and
services paid under a prospective payment system when the existing payment
amounts are determined to be inherently unreasonable payment amounts may be
considered unreasonable because they are either grossly excessive or deficient
we cannot provide any assurances to investors that fees payable by medicare
could not be reduced as a result of the application of this rule or that the
government might not assert claims for reimbursement by purporting to
retroactively apply this rule or the oig interpretation concerning usual
charges

     currently there are no medicare coinsurance or copayments required for
clinical laboratory testing when coinsurance was last in effect in 1984
clinical laboratories received from medicare carriers only 80 of the medicare
allowed amount and were required to bill medicare beneficiaries for the unpaid
balance of the medicare allowed amount if enacted a coinsurance proposal
could adversely affect the revenues of the clinical laboratory industry
including us by exposing the testing laboratory to the credit of individuals
and by increasing the number of bills in addition a laboratory could be
subject to potential fraud and abuse violations if adequate procedures to bill
and collect the coinsurance payments are not established and followed

     reduced utilization of clinical laboratory testing in recent years cms
has taken several steps to reduce utilization of clinical laboratory testing
since 1995 medicare carriers have adopted policies under which they do not pay
for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has
provided an appropriate diagnostic code supporting the medical necessity of the
test physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they
order clinical tests for medicare and medicaid patients however cms has not
prescribed any penalty for physicians who fail to provide diagnostic information
to laboratories

     we are generally permitted to bill patients directly for some statutorily
excluded clinical laboratory services we are also generally permitted to bill
patients for clinical laboratory tests that medicare does not pay for due to
medical necessity limitations these tests include limited coverage tests for
which a carrierapproved diagnosis code is not


                                       15

provided by the ordering physician and certain tests ordered at a frequency
greater than covered by medicare if the patient signs an advance beneficiary
notice abn under which the patient makes an informed decision as to whether
to personally assume financial liability for laboratory tests which are likely
to be not covered by medicare because they are deemed to be not medically
necessary we do not have any direct contact with most of these patients and in
such cases cannot control the proper use of the abn by the physician or the
physicians office staff if the abn is not timely completed or is not completed
properly we end up performing tests that we cannot subsequently bill to the
patient if they are not reimbursable by medicare in 2002 cms adopted a
standard cmsapproved abn form because the new form is longer and more complex
than the format previously used by most laboratories adoption of the new abn
form could result in even fewer valid abns and consequently prevent us from
billing additional beneficiaries for services denied by medicare for lack of
medical necessity

     inconsistent practices currently many different local carriers administer
medicare they have inconsistent policies on matters such as 1 test coverage
2 automated chemistry panels 3 diagnosis coding 4 claims documentation
and 5 fee schedules subject to the national limitations inconsistent
regulation has increased the complexity of the billing process for clinical
laboratories as part of the 1997 balanced budget act hhs was required to adopt
uniform policies on the above matters by january 1 1999 and replace the
current local carriers with no more than five regional carriers although hhs
has finalized a number of uniform policies it has not taken any final action to
replace the local carriers with five regional carriers however in november
2000 cms published a solicitation in the commerce business daily seeking two
contractors to process part b clinical laboratory claims in the solicitation
cms stated that the secretary has decided to limit the number of carriers
processing clinical diagnostic laboratory test claims to two contractors the
solicitation indicated that the request for proposal would be released on
or before december 31 2000 but as of february 2003 it had not been issued the
solicitation did not indicate the effective date for a final transition to the
regional carrier model we are not aware of any plans by cms to transition to
fewer regional carriers for laboratory services despite the legislative mandate
of the 1997 balanced budget act

     cms plans to achieve standardization in part through implementing a single
claims processing system for all carriers this initiative however was
suspended due to cmss year 2000 compliance priorities

     competitive bidding the 1997 balanced budget act requires cms to conduct
five medicare bidding demonstrations involving various types of medical services
and complete them by 2002 cms is expected to include a clinical laboratory
demonstration project in a metropolitan statistical area as part of the
legislative mandate florida has issued a proposal for competitive bidding for
its medicaid program if competitive bidding were implemented on a regional or
national basis for clinical laboratory testing it could materially adversely
affect the clinical laboratory industry and us

     future legislation future changes in federal state and local regulations
or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental
reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing could adversely affect us we
cannot predict however whether and what type of legislative proposals will be
enacted into law or what regulations will be adopted by regulatory authorities

     fraud and abuse regulations medicare and medicaid antikickback laws
prohibit clinical laboratories from making payments or furnishing other benefits
to influence the referral of tests billed to medicare medicaid or other federal
programs as noted above the penalties for violation of these laws may include
criminal and civil fines and penalties andor suspension or exclusion from
participation in federal programs many of the antifraud statutes and
regulations including those relating to joint ventures and alliances are vague
or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts we cannot predict if
some of the fraud and abuse rules will be interpreted contrary to our practices

     in november 1999 the oig issued an advisory opinion concluding that the
industry practice of discounting client bills may constitute a kickback if the
discounted price is below a laboratorys overall cost including overhead and
below the amounts reimbursed by medicare advisory opinions are not binding but
may be indicative of the position that prosecutors may take in enforcement
actions the oigs opinion if enforced could result in fines and possible
exclusion and could require us to eliminate offering discounts to clients below
the rates reimbursed by medicare the oig subsequently issued a letter
clarifying that it did not intend to imply that discounts are a per se violation
of the federal antikickback statute but may merit further investigation
depending on the facts and circumstances presented

     in addition since 1992 a federal antiselfreferral law commonly known
as the stark law prohibits with certain exceptions medicare payments for
laboratory tests referred by physicians who have personally or through a family
member an investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with the
testing laboratory since january 1995 these restrictions have also applied to
medicaidcovered services many states have similar antiselfreferral and


                                       16





page

other laws that also affect investment and compensation arrangements with
physicians who refer other than governmentreimbursed laboratory testing to us
we cannot predict if some of the state laws will be interpreted contrary to our
practices

government investigations and related claims

     we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and
local laws and regulations we believe that based on our experience with
government settlements and public announcements by various government officials
the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare fraud
in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give
federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and
remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in
material compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable
to us including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those
relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals are vague or indefinite
and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied
by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could
require us to make changes in our operations including our billing practices
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil
and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to
participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare
programs

     during the mid1990s quest diagnostics and sbcl settled government claims
that primarily involved industrywide billing and marketing practices that both
companies believed to be lawful the aggregate amount of the settlements for
these claims exceeded 500 million the federal or state governments may bring
additional claims based on new theories as to our practices that we believe to
be in compliance with law the federal government has substantial leverage in
negotiating settlements since the amount of potential fines far exceeds the
rates at which we are reimbursed and the government has the remedy of excluding
a noncompliant provider from participation in the medicare and medicaid
programs which represented approximately 15 of our net revenues during 2002

     although management believes that established reserves for claims are
sufficient it is possible that additional information may become available that
may cause the final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves
by an amount which could be material to our results of operations and cash flows
in the period in which such claims are settled we do not believe that these
issues will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition
however we understand that there may be pending qui tam claims brought by
former employees or other whistle blowers as to which we have not been
provided with a copy of the complaint and accordingly cannot determine the
extent of any potential liability

     as an integral part of our compliance program discussed below we
investigate all reported or suspected failures to comply with federal healthcare
reimbursement requirements any noncompliance that results in medicare or
medicaid overpayments is reported to the government and reimbursed by us as a
result of these efforts we have periodically identified and reported
overpayments while we have reimbursed these overpayments and have taken
corrective action where appropriate we cannot assure investors that in each
instance the government will necessarily accept these actions as sufficient

compliance program

     compliance with all government rules and regulations has become a
significant concern throughout the clinical laboratory industry because of
evolving interpretations of regulations and the national debate over healthcare
we began a compliance program early in 1993

     we emphasize the development of training programs intended to ensure the
strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws regulations and
company policies further we conduct indepth reviews of procedures personnel
and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations the
quality safety and compliance committee of the board of directors requires
periodic reporting of compliance operations from management in october 1996 we
signed a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the oig that expired in
october 2001

     we believe we comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes
and regulations however we cannot assure you that no statutes or regulations
will be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial
authority in a manner that would adversely affect us potential sanctions for
violation of these statutes include significant damages penalties and fines
exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of
various licenses certificates and authorization necessary to operate some or
all of our business

insurance

     as a general matter providers of clinical laboratory testing services may
be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims these
suits could involve claims for substantial damages any professional liability
litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation
we maintain various liability insurance programs for claims that could result
from providing or failing to provide clinical laboratory testing services
including inaccurate testing results and other exposures our insurance coverage
limits our maximum exposure on individual claims however we are essentially
selfinsured for a significant portion of these claims the basis for claims
reserves incorporates actuarially determined losses based upon our historical
and projected loss experience management believes that present insurance
coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures but
we cannot assure you that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded
reserves similarly although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate
insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs we cannot assure you that
we will be able to do so

employees

     at december 31 2002 and 2001 we employed approximately 33400 and 29000
people respectively these totals exclude employees of the joint ventures where
