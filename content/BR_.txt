we operate our business in two reportable segments investor communication solutions and global technology and operations 

investor communication solutions 

the investor communication solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 75 and 77 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the united states of america “us” dollar see “analysis of reportable segments — revenues” under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we provide the following services and solutions through our investor communication solutions segment 

regulatory solutions 

we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank brokerdealer and fund clients we offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a rules engine and database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on their websites email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting via web or mobile app we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors we also offer proxy vote solicitation services for the registered clients of fund companies efficiently managing the entire proxy campaign in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of all international institutional and retail proxies including shareholder disclosure management 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their customers the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with the information of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and shareholdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank as dtcc’s role is only as the custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for nominees companies and investors a large number of nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority the nominee receives from the dtcc via an omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials on a timely basis digitally or in print that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies and funds conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of their particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company andor fund to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and timely manner as it would increase the costs for companies and funds to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies and funds work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed on a timely basis to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

the sec’s rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees for certain services provided by intermediaries such as broadridge in the proxy process the preparation and delivery of nobo information is subject to reimbursement by the corporate issuers requesting the information the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also determine the fees to be paid to thirdparty intermediaries such as broadridge who compile the nobo information on behalf of nominees who need to respond to corporate issuer requests for nobo information

privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals federal and state regulators and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain personal information privacy laws outside the us may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than us laws and regulations and they may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use and transfer of personal information accompanied by legislation regulations and enforcement activity intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy 

the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients for example the european union parliament adopted the comprehensive general data protection regulation “gdpr” and t he california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became effective as of january 2020 and the california consumer privacy rights act “cpra” will become effective on january 1 2023 in addition several us states have also recently adopted new privacy laws or are proposing to pass their own state privacy laws 

we continually monitor privacy and information security laws and regulations and w hile we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

legal compliance 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs sanctions lists and specially designated nationals and blocked persons list a published list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our businesses with an international reach can be complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions our international business could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations these laws and regulations include import and export requirements trade restrictions and embargoes data privacy requirements labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements such as the uk bribery act although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations particularly as we expand our operations including through acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also damage our reputation our international expansion efforts and our business and negatively impact our operating results

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the most significant factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of products and services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our products and services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services such as our proxy shareholder report distribution and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations including those governing the financial services industry and the securities markets changes in laws and regulations could require changes in the services we provide or the manner in which we provide our services or they could result in a reduction or elimination of the demand for our services 

our investor communications services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable sec or stock exchange rules or regulations are amended or new laws or regulations are adopted which could result in a material negative impact on our business and financial results for example the sec’s recently proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchangetraded fund disclosure framework could have an impact on our services business and financial results if adopted and implemented as proposed 

in addition new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from any of our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our service s in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry and the loss of any of such clients could have a material impact on our revenues and also result in an asset writedown of our client onboarding costs 

in fiscal year 2022 we derived approximately 46 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 7 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2022 while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also a delay in onboarding a client onto our technology would result in a delay in our recognition of revenue from that client further in the event of a reduction of a client’s demand for our services or the loss of a client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client we could be required to writeoff any client investments that are not offset by any contract termination fees including costs incurred to onboard a client or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 15 of our total assets as of june 30 2022 with one client representing a large portion of such amount  

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare companies we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cybersecurity attacks however information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

in certain circumstances our thirdparty vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information it is also possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information we require our thirdparty vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers or our employees however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced nonmaterial cybersecurity attacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic continues to persist throughout the world including the us india canada europe and other locations where we operate to date the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy created significant financial market volatility disrupted global supply chains and resulted in a significant number of infections and deaths worldwide 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken and expect to continue to take measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients these measures have increased our expenses and we may continue to incur such expenses 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy our employees our clients and our thirdparty service providers we continue to work with our stakeholders to responsibly address the effects of this global pandemic and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate any adverse consequences however we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the pandemic the emergence of new virus variants outbreaks occurring at any of our facilities and changes in worldwide and us economic conditions 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra dol various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations or provide revised interpretations or they may change the enforcement priorities with respect to existing laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives impact the way in which we conduct our business requiring changes to the way we provide our services or additional investment which may make our business more or less profitable further as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business with an increased focus on cybersecurity and vendor risk management the ffiec and other regulatory agencies provide guidelines for overseeing technology service providers increasing the contractual requirements with our clients and the cost of providing our services 

our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing these services we could be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines in addition we could lose clients and our reputation could be harmed negatively impacting our ability to attract new clients 

as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the glba hipaa the ccpa and the gdpr in the european union and we are subject to compliance with various client industry standards such as pci dss as well as medicare and medicaid programs related to our clients we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations and requirements and such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients 

our ability to comply with regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes in addition our eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special corporate events and transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations  

we may be adversely impacted by a failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

we rely on relationships with third parties including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty vendors operate our financial results or reputation could suffer we rely on these third parties including our data center and cloud services providers to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own cybersecurity risks failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

certain of our businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in such circumstances we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key thirdparty vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given among other reasons the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our service providers the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally 

if we change a significant vendor an existing service provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations or is acquired or we seek to bring inhouse certain services performed today by third parties we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

furthermore certain thirdparty service providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data including that provided to us by our clients it is possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other thirdparty carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and thirdparty carriers including the united parcel service for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather increased fuel costs any failure to deliver communications to or on behalf of our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery causing disruptions in the service if our relationship with any of these thirdparty carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather as well as events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack pandemic or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems our systems those of our data center and cloud services providers or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

• computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems 

• direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks 

• inability to rapidly monitor all system activity 

• inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected 

• heavy stress placed on systems during peak times or due to high volumes or volatility or 

• power or telecommunications failure fire flood pandemic or any other disaster 

while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations and use thirdparty cloud services providers for storage of certain data the operation performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

the inability to properly perform our services or operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the inability or the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition the inability to properly perform our services or errors in the performance of our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

our services are impacted by the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets these factors are in turn affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets for example the covid19 pandemic and russia’s invasion of ukraine have adversely impacted global commercial activity and have had a negative impact on the global economy adversely impacting our clients these factors include 

• economic political and market conditions 

• legislative and regulatory changes 

• the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital 

• the level and volatility of interest rates 

• currency values and inflation 

• financial wellbeing of our clients and 

• national state and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients or adapt to technological changes or advances our business and future growth could be impacted 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on thirdparty service providers such as our cloud services provider 

in addition we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients and harm our business and impact our future growth 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform comparable functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain retain enforce and protect important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon a combination of patents trademarks service marks copyrights domain names and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property and marks we also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to our services software and proprietary information moreover we license or acquire technology that we incorporate into our services and products 

despite our efforts to identify obtain retain enforce and protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information we cannot be certain that they will be effective or sufficient to prevent the unauthorized access use copying theft or the reverse engineering of our intellectual property and proprietary information for a variety of reasons including a our inability to detect misappropriation by third parties of our intellectual property b disparate legal protections for intellectual property across different countries c constantly evolving intellectual property legal standards as to the scope of protection validity noninfringement enforceability and infringement defenses d failure to maintain appropriate contractual restrictions and other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets or contract breaches by others e failure to identify and obtain patents on patentable innovations f potential invalidation unenforceability scope narrowing dilution and opposition through litigation and administrative processes both in the us and abroad of our intellectual property rights and g other business or resource limitations on intellectual property enforcement against third parties 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims whether initiated by or against us could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

costly complex timeconsuming and unpredictable litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or challenge the purported validity or scope of thirdparty intellectual property further although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights all intellectual property litigations even baseless claims result in significant expense and diversion of resources our management and time any adverse outcome in an intellectual property litigation may materially and adversely affect our brand business operations and financial condition and require us to license the technology of others on unfavorable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us as a result we may need to undertake workarounds or substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

we use thirdparty open source software in our products and services though we have a policy review board and review process in place governing the use of open source software there is a risk that we incorporate into our products and services open source software with onerous licensing terms that purportedly require us to make the source code of our proprietary code combined with such open source software available under such license furthermore us courts have not interpreted the terms of various open source licenses but could interpret them in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products and services usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software given that licensors generally disclaim all warranties on their open source software and hackers frequently exploit vulnerabilities in open source software any use of open source software inconsistent with its license or our policy could harm our business operations and financial position 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies technologies or products or enter joint ventures in fact over the last three fiscal years we have completed 10 acquisitions and made strategic investments in seven firms these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

• valuation  finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews 

• integration  managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets and converting their financial information security privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition and 

• legacy issues  protecting against actions claims regulatory investigations losses and other liabilities related to the predecessor business 

also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

• incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions 

• devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business 

• borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us 

• additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition could impact our liquidity and may cause a credit downgrade 

• loss of clients of the acquired business 

• entering markets where we have minimal prior experience and 

• experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

in addition international acquisitions such as our 2021 acquisition of itiviti often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• enforcing intellectual property rights in some nonus countries and 

• general economic and political conditions 

we have incurred additional debt in connection with the itiviti acquisition which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position which could in turn adversely affect our business 

as of june 30 2022 we had 37930 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt additionally our revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of 14750 million as of june 30 2022 our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions to fund growth or for general corporate purposes even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations 

• limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments capital expenditures working capital business activities and other general corporate requirements and 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance which could be affected by financial business economic and other factors if we are not able to pay our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell assets borrow more money or raise additional equity capital in addition if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would also have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations further a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients 

we may incur noncash impairment charges in the future associated with our portfolio of intangible assets including goodwill 

as a result of past acquisitions we carry a significant goodwill and other acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet in addition we also defer certain costs to onboard a client or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology goodwill intangible assets net and deferred client conversion and startup costs accounted for approximately 71 of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30 2022 we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31st and we test goodwill intangible assets net and deferred client conversion and startup costs for impairment at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable although no indications of an impairment have been identified there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future particularly in the event of a prolonged economic recession or loss of a key client or clients a significant noncash impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us as a result of our 2021 acquisition of itiviti our revenues generated outside the us have increased by 33 and we now operate in 20 countries outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies 

in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic for example the continuation or worsening of the covid19 pandemic and its variants or other local or global health issue or the broader economic consequences of the conflict in ukraine could adversely impact our operations and financial results 

certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

our mutual fund and exchangetraded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the us and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10k these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and nonmarketable securities intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 the company revised the foreign exchange rates used to present segment revenues segment earnings loss before income taxes and closed sales to further allocate the foreign exchange impact to the individual segment revenue and profit metrics the presentation of segment revenues and earnings loss before income taxes for the prior periods provided has been changed to conform to the current period presentation total consolidated revenues and earnings before income taxes were not impacted 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we had 34849 million of goodwill as of june 30 2022 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 595 million as of june 30 2022 of which 88 million are subject to expiration in the june 30 2023 through june 30 2042 period the remaining 507 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 413 million of which 204 million are subject to expiration in the june 30 2023 through june 30 2037 period with the balance of 209 million having an indefinite utilization period us federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the company did not generate federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 107 million and 105 million at june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments  accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2022 stock option grants would result in approximately a 25 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2022 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2022 stock option grants would result in approximately a 10 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2022 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2022 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2022 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2022 stock option grants would result in approximately a 10 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2022 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

key performance indicators 

management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan measure and evaluate the company’s business and financial performance these performance indicators include revenue and recurring fee revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” of adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share free cash flow and closed sales in addition management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth as defined below

revenues 

revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technologyenabled services and solutions the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs fee revenues are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity the level of recurring and eventdriven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

recurring fee revenue growth represents the company’s total annual fee revenue growth less growth from eventdriven fee revenues we distinguish recurring fee revenue growth between organic and acquired 

• organic – we define organic revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from net new business and internal growth 

• acquired – we define acquired revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase integrate and leverage the value of assets we acquire 

revenues and recurring fee revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company’s ongoing operational performance see “results of operations” as well as note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

record growth and internal trade growth 

the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business record growth is defined as stock record growth and interim record growth which measure the estimated annual change in total positions eligible for equity proxy materials and mutual fund and exchangetraded fund interim communications respectively for equities and mutual fund position data reported to broadridge in both the current and prior year periods internal trade growth represents the estimated change in daily average trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods record growth and internal trade growth are useful nonfinancial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments respectively

“software charge” represents a charge related to an internal use software product that is no longer expected to be used 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

• mutual fund proxy the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors subadvisors fee structures investment restrictions and mergers of funds 

• mutual fund communications mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers in addition mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters 

• equity proxy contests and specials corporate actions and other the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests mergers and acquisitions and tenderexchange offers 

eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2022 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 57 greater than the prior fiscal year during fiscal year 2021 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 17 greater than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 we are reporting closed sales net of a 50 allowance adjustment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 we reported closed sales net of a 50 allowance adjustment consequently our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported we assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years actual data as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 closed sales were 2819 million and 2321 million respectively the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 are net of an allowance adjustment of 148 million and 122 million respectively

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances nongaap results have been presented these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance depending on the period presented these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs iii real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses iv russiarelated exit costs v investment gains vi software charge and vii gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents noncash amortization expenses associated with the company’s acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses are comprised of two major components real estate realignment expenses and covid19 related expenses real estate realignment expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the company’s leased facilities in response to the covid19 pandemic which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets leasehold improvements and equipment as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from and attributable to the exit of these leased facilities covid19 related expense are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the company to protect the health and safety of broadridge associates during the covid19 outbreak including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to company facilities on a more regular basis ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities and other safety related expenses russiarelated exit costs are direct and incremental costs associated with the company’s wind down of business activities in russia in response to russia’s invasion of ukraine including relocationrelated expenses of impacted associates investment gains represent nonoperating noncash gains on privately held investments software charge represents a charge related to an internal use software product that is no longer expected to be used gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument represents a nonoperating gain on a financial instrument designed to minimize the companys foreign exchange risk associated with the itiviti acquisition as well as certain other nonoperating financing costs associated with the itiviti acquisition 

we exclude acquisition and integration costs real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses russiarelated exit costs investment gains the software charge and the gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument from our adjusted operating income as applicable and other adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property as these noncash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the companys capital allocation decisions management compensation metrics or multiyear objectives furthermore management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets 

free cash flow 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities plus proceeds from asset sales less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited 







a real estate realignment expenses were 230 million and 296 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively covid19 related expenses were 75 million and 157 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

b real estate realignment expenses impacted adjusted earnings per share by 019 and 025 for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively covid19 related expenses impacted adjusted earnings per share by 006 and 013 for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

c calculated using the gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude 181 million of excess tax benefits “etb” associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 and 169 million of etb associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 the tax impact of adjustments also excludes approximately 106 million of acquisition and integration costs for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 which are not taxdeductible for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share the same adjustments were made on a per share basis 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources

we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds however while we may do so at a future date the company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund us operations

cash flows 

fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 



the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 1966 million was primarily due to increased scaling of clientrelated platform implementation and development as well as higher cash used in working capital partially offset by higher net noncash addbacks including higher amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities of 25433 million primarily reflects lower acquisition spend in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior year period most notably the itiviti acquisition partially offset by the fiscal year 2021 667 million forward foreign exchange derivative inflow associated with the itiviti acquisition that did not recur in fiscal year 2022 

the increase in cash used in financing activities of 21685 million primarily reflects lower borrowings net of repayments most notably to finance the itiviti acquisition in the prior year period

it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments in january 2022 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swap transactions which were designated as a net investment hedge against a portion of our net investment in our euro functional subsidiaries we were not a party to any outstanding derivative financial instruments at june 30 2021 

in january 2022 we executed a series of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of eur 880 million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro the crosscurrency swap derivative contracts are agreements to pay fixedrate interest in euros and receive fixedrate interest in us dollars thereby effectively converting a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate debt into euro denominated fixedrate debt the crosscurrency swaps mature in may 2031 to coincide with the maturity of the fiscal 2021 senior notes accordingly foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income loss net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary at june 30 2022 our position on the crosscurrency swaps was an asset of 1014 million and is recorded as part of other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets with the offsetting amount recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax we have elected the spot method of accounting whereby the net interest savings from the crosscurrency swaps is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 

in connection with the itiviti acquisition in march 2021 we entered into two derivative instruments designed to mitigate the company’s exposure to the impact of i changes in foreign exchange rates on the itiviti acquisition purchase consideration and ii changes in interest rates on the fiscal 2021 senior notes 

in march 2021 we executed a forward foreign exchange derivative instrument “forward” with an aggregate notional amount of eur 1955 billion the forward acted as an economic hedge against the impact of changes in the euro on the company’s purchase consideration for the itiviti acquisition we recorded changes in fair value of the forward as part of other nonoperating income expenses net in the consolidated statement of earnings in may 2021 we settled the forward derivative for a cumulative pretax gain of 667 million 

also we executed a forward treasury lock agreement “treasury lock” designated as a cash flow hedge in the aggregate notional amount of 10 billion to manage exposure to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate associated with the fiscal 2021 senior notes which were used to pay down a portion of the term credit agreement associated with the itiviti acquisition accordingly changes in the fair value of the treasury lock were recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss net each period up to when the treasury lock was settled in may 2021 the treasury lock was settled for a pretax loss of 110 million after which the final settlement loss will be amortized into interest expense net ratably over the ten year term of the fiscal 2021 senior notes the expected amount of the existing loss that will be amortized into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately 11 million 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our products and services we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2022 15608 million or 41 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 37930 million is based on floating interest rates our 15608 million in variable rate debt at june 30 2022 consists of our revolving credit facility which depending on the currency of the loan bears interest at libor cdor euribor tibor and stibor plus 1015 per annum subject to stepups to 1175 and stepdowns to 0805 based on ratings or sonia plus 10476 per annum subject to stepups to 12076 and stepdowns to 08376 based on ratings plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 110 basis points on the entire facility subject to stepups to 200 basis points and stepdowns to 70 basis points based on ratings and the outstanding portion of our fiscal 2021 term loans which bears interest at libor plus 0875 per annum subject to stepups to libor plus 1250 or a stepdown to libor plus 0750 based on ratings we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility and fiscal 2021 term loans during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 197 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 however this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 however this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 15 of our fiscal year 2022 revenues were earned outside of the us our operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada europe and india as a result we are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our nonus dollardenominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions primarily with respect to the canadian dollar the british pound the euro the indian rupee and the swedish krona 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate in addition we executed a series of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of eur 880 million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro at june 30 2022 the fair value of these derivatives is an asset of 1014 million refer to note 18 “contractual commitments contingencies and offbalance sheet arrangements” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for additional details on our crosscurrency swap derivative contracts 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound the euro the indian rupee and the swedish krona versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 128 million and 193 million respectively

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

the investor communication solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 77 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar see “analysis of reportable segments — revenues” under “item 701 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we provide the following services and solutions through our investor communication solutions segment 

regulatory solutions 

we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank brokerdealer and fund clients we offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a rules engine and database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on their websites email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting via web or mobile app we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors we also offer proxy vote solicitation services for the registered clients of fund companies efficiently managing the entire proxy campaign in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies with the ability to process proxy voting in over 100 international markets 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their customers the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with the information of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and shareholdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank as dtcc’s role is only as the custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for both nominees companies and investors a large number of nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority the nominee receives from the dtcc via an omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials on a timely basis digitally or in print that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies and funds conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of their particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company andor fund to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and timely manner with respect to companies and funds as it would increase the costs for companies and funds to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies and funds work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed on a timely basis to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

the sec’s rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees for certain services provided by intermediaries such as broadridge in the proxy process the preparation and delivery of nobo information is subject to reimbursement by the corporate issuers requesting the information the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also determine the fees to be paid to thirdparty intermediaries such as broadridge who compile the nobo information on behalf of nominees who need to respond to corporate issuer requests for nobo information 

we provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage and track the entire proxy voting process including meeting their reporting needs proxyedge is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy voting can be instructed for the entire position by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers proxyedge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting proxyedge can be utilized for meetings of us and canadian companies and for meetings in many nonnorth american countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients proxyedge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 7000 proxyedge users worldwide

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation regulations and enforcement activity intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy 

the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients for example the european union parliament adopted the comprehensive general data protection regulation “gdpr” and t he california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became effective as of january 2020 and the california consumer privacy rights act “cpra” will become effective on january 1 2023 in addition several us states have also recently adopted new privacy laws or are proposing to pass their own state privacy laws 

we continually monitor privacy and information security laws and regulations and w hile we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

legal compliance 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs sanctions lists and specially designated nationals and blocked persons list for example individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our businesses with an international reach can be complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions our international business could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations these laws and regulations include import and export requirements trade restrictions and embargoes data privacy requirements labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements such as the uk bribery act although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations particularly as we expand our operations including through acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also damage our reputation our international expansion efforts and our business and negatively impact our operating results 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the most significant factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic is having a significant effect on the world economy which has created significant uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy our employees our clients and our thirdparty service providers the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and business and economic disruption any of the following factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could negatively affect our operations and performance of our services increase our costs and negatively impact our sales results of operations and our liquidity position possibly to a significant degree 

• the covid19 pandemic and the stayathome orders and quarantine rules resulting from the pandemic could have an impact on our ability to perform our services and the operations of our facilities our ability to provide our services and solutions could be negatively impacted including as a result of our employees or our clients’ and vendors’ employees working remotely or due to business slowdown or interruption caused by the illness of our employees or the safety measures implemented to prevent the illness of our employees such as the potential closures of offices and facilities in addition a resurgence of the covid19 virus in the areas where we operate could result in additional stayathome orders being put in place our inability or failure to properly perform our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

• we have taken several measures in response to covid19 including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities taking the temperature of productionrelated employees in affected areas and continuing remote work for many of our employees we may take further actions in our facilities as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees clients and vendors including as employees return to our offices there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 or will be satisfactory to government authorities 

• we are a global company and our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers the pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity an extended period of market disruption or closures or a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact our business and financial results we could experience a decrease in demand for our services or a delay or reduction in our sales if a prolonged economic downturn causes financial stress for our clients we could also experience a delay in onboarding our clients further a sustained decline in market values could result in decreased assets under administration negatively impacting our mutual fund processing business in addition lower interest rates have negatively impacted our mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses 

• the technological resources and infrastructure used by us as well as the thirdparty service providers and vendors who support us such as internet capacity may be strained due to the increase in the number of remote users in addition we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of employees who are working remotely in regions impacted by stayathome orders or observing quarantine safety measures increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family and work responsibilities at home 

• we rely on thirdparty service providers and vendors to provide critical systems and services such as data center services and materials needed for the production and delivery of our print services and the covid19 pandemic could present heightened or novel risks with respect to the continuity of our critical vendors’ services or ability to supply materials including the possibility of closure or business interruption 

• there is a potential risk that members of our senior management team andor our board of directors could become incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time due to illness resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the covid19 pandemic and as a result its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change we cannot foresee the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy and the full impact will depend on numerous evolving factors that are outside our control however the effects could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial performance 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2021 we derived approximately 51 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2021 while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client we would be required to writeoff any investments made by us in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 10 of our total assets as of june 30 2021 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare companies we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cybersecurity attacks 

in certain circumstances our thirdparty vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information it is also possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information we require our thirdparty vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers or our employees however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced nonmaterial cybersecurity attacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services such as our proxy services shareholder report distribution and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets changes in laws and regulations could require changes in the services we provide or the manner in which we provide our services or they could result in a reduction or elimination of the demand for our services 

our investor communications services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable sec or stock exchange rules or regulations are amended or new laws or regulations are adopted which could result in a material negative impact on our business and financial results for example the sec’s recently proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchangetraded fund disclosure framework could have an impact on our services business and financial results if adopted and implemented as proposed 

in addition new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra dol various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations or provide revised interpretations or they may change the enforcement priorities with respect to existing laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may impact the way in which we conduct our business requiring changes to the way we provide our services or additional investment which may make our business less profitable further as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business with an increased focus on vendor risk management the ffiec and other regulatory agencies provide guidelines for overseeing technology service providers increasing the contractual requirements with our clients and the cost of providing our services 

our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing these services we could be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines in addition we could lose clients and our reputation could be harmed negatively impacting our ability to attract new clients 

as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the glba hipaa the ccpa and the gdpr in the eu and we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

our ability to comply with regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes in addition our eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special corporate events and transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

we rely on relationships with third parties including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty vendors operate our financial results or reputation could suffer we rely on these third parties including our data center and cloud services providers to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own cybersecurity risks failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

certain of our businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in such circumstances we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key thirdparty vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given among other reasons the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our service providers the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally 

if we change a significant vendor an existing service provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations or is acquired or we seek to bring inhouse certain services performed today by third parties we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

furthermore certain thirdparty service providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients it is possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other thirdparty carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and thirdparty carriers including the united parcel service for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather increased fuel costs and suspension of delivery of communications to certain countries as a result of the covid19 pandemic any failure to deliver communications to or on behalf of our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery causing disruptions in the service if our relationship with any of these thirdparty carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack pandemic or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems our systems those of our data center and cloud services providers or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

• computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems 

• direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks 

• inability to rapidly monitor all system activity 

• inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected 

• heavy stress placed on systems during peak times or due to high volumes or volatility or 

• power or telecommunications failure fire flood pandemic or any other disaster 

while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations and use thirdparty cloud services providers for storage of certain data the operation performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

the inability to properly perform our services or operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the inability or the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition the inability to properly perform our services or errors in the performance of our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

our services are impacted by the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets these factors are in turn affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets for example the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to a general economic recession adversely impacting our clients these factors include 

• economic political and market conditions 

• legislative and regulatory changes 

• the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital 

• the level and volatility of interest rates 

• currency values and inflation 

• financial wellbeing of our clients and 

• national state and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients or adapt to technological changes or advances our business and future growth could be impacted 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on thirdparty service providers such as our cloud services provider 

in addition we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients and harm our business and impact our future growth 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if in response to a thirdparty infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such thirdparty’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies technologies or products or enter joint ventures these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

• valuation  finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews 

• integration  managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets and converting their financial information security privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition and 

• legacy issues  protecting against actions claims regulatory investigations losses and other liabilities related to the predecessor business 

also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

• finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms 

• competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors 

• incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions 

• devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business 

• borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us 

• additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition could impact our liquidity and may cause a credit downgrade 

• loss of clients of the acquired business 

• entering markets where we have minimal prior experience and 

• experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• enforcing intellectual property rights in some nonus countries and 

• general economic and political conditions 

we have incurred additional debt in connection with the itiviti acquisition which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position which could in turn adversely affect our business 

as of june 30 2021 we had 39144 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt additionally our revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of 13856 million as of june 30 2021 our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions to fund growth or for general corporate purposes even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations 

• limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments capital expenditures working capital business activities and other general corporate requirements and 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance which could be affected by financial business economic and other factors if we are not able to pay our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell assets borrow more money or raise additional equity capital in addition if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would also have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations further a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients 

we may incur noncash goodwill impairment charges in the future 

as a result of past acquisitions we carry a significant goodwill balance on our balance sheet goodwill accounted for approximately 46 of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30 2021 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which will likely result in our recognition of additional goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31st and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable although no indications of a goodwill impairment have been identified there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future particularly in the event of a prolonged economic recession a significant noncash goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies 

for example the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” became effective on january 31 2020 and on december 24 2020 the united kingdom and the european union entered into the euuk trade and cooperation agreement which governs bilateral relations in areas such as trade intellectual property and energy however the postbrexit relationship between the united kingdom and the european union is new and evolving and any continuing legal or economic disruptions resulting from brexit may negatively impact our clients with operations in the united kingdom which may cause them to reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic including a continuation or worsening of the covid19 pandemic and its variants or other local or global health issue 

certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

our mutual fund and exchangetraded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies this causes our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

none 




 item 2 properties 

we operate our business primarily from 60 facilities we lease three facilities in edgewood new york and facilities in el dorado hills california south windsor connecticut kansas city missouri coppell texas and markham canada with a combined space of 22 million square feet which are used in connection with our investor communication solutions business we also lease a facility in newark new jersey which houses our principal global technology and operations business operations we also lease space at 50 additional locations subject to customary lease arrangements and which expire on a staggered basis and we also own a facility in mount laurel nj we believe our facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained 




 item 3 legal proceedings

dividend policy 

we expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock on august 11 2021 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 0065 per share to 064 per share an increase in our expected annual dividend amount from 230 to 256 per share the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings capital requirements of our businesses legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant 

as a holding company substantially all our assets being comprised of the capital stock of our subsidiaries our ability to pay dividends will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries our subsidiaries through which we provide our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are regulated and may be subject to restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us we do not believe that these restrictions are significant enough to impact the company’s ability to pay dividends

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the us and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10k these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and nonmarketable securities intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable except as it relates to asu no 201602 as amended “leases” “asu no 201602” 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

effective july 1 2019 the company adopted asu no 201602 “leases” and its related amendments collectively referred to as “asu 201602 as amended” by recognizing a rou asset and corresponding lease liability along with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption under this method of adoption the company has not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation additional information about the impact of the companys adoption of asu no 201602 as amended is included in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 8 “leases” to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we had 37201 million of goodwill as of june 30 2021 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 630 million as of june 30 2021 of which 79 million are subject to expiration in the june 30 2022 through june 30 2041 period the remaining 551 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 435 million of which 244 million are subject to expiration in the june 30 2022 through june 30 2037 period with the balance of 191 million having an indefinite utilization period us federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 105 million and 67 million at june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments  accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2021 stock option grants would result in approximately a 22 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2021 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2021 stock option grants would result in approximately a 07 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2021 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2021 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2021 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2021 stock option grants would result in approximately a 08 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2021 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

key performance indicators 

management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan measure and evaluate the company’s business and financial performance these performance indicators include revenue and recurring fee revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” of adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and closed sales in addition management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth as defined below 

refer to the section “explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measures and an explanation for why these nongaap metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these nongaap metrics for operational and financial decisionmaking refer to the section “results of operations” for a description of closed sales and an explanation of why closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors 

revenues 

revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technologyenabled services and solutions the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs fee revenues are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity the level of recurring and eventdriven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

recurring fee revenue growth represents the company’s total annual fee revenue growth less growth from eventdriven fee revenues we distinguish recurring fee revenue growth between organic and acquired 

• organic – we define organic revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from net new business and internal growth 

• acquired – we define acquired revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase integrate and leverage the value of assets we acquire 

revenues and recurring fee revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company’s ongoing operational performance see “results of operations” as well as note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

record growth and internal trade growth 

the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business record growth is defined as stock record growth and interim record growth which measure the estimated annual change in total positions eligible for equity proxy materials and mutual fund and exchangetraded fund interim communications respectively for equities and mutual fund position data reported to broadridge in both the current and prior year periods internal trade growth represents the estimated change in trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods record growth and internal trade growth are useful nonfinancial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments respectively 

the key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 is disclosed in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the 2020 annual report 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property” and “acquisition and integration costs” represent noncash amortization expenses associated with the company’s acquisition activities as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities respectively 

“ibm private cloud charges” represent a charge on the hardware assets transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement 

“real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses” represent costs associated with the companys real estate realignment initiative including lease exit and impairment charges and other facility exit costs as well as certain expenses associated with the covid19 pandemic 

“investment gain” represents a nonoperating noncash gain on a privately held investment 

“software charge” represents a charge related to an internal use software product that is no longer expected to be used 

“gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument” represents a nonoperating gain on a financial instrument designed to minimize the companys foreign exchange risk associated with the acquisition of itiviti the “itiviti acquisition” as well as certain other nonoperating financing costs associated with the itiviti acquisition 

“gain on sale of a joint venture investment” represents a nonoperating cash gain on the sale of one of the company’s joint venture investments 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

• mutual fund proxy the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors subadvisors fee structures investment restrictions and mergers of funds 

• mutual fund communications mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers in addition mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters 

• equity proxy contests and specials corporate actions and other the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests mergers and acquisitions and tenderexchange offers 

eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2021 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 17 greater than the prior fiscal year during fiscal year 2020 mutual fund proxy revenues were 35 lower than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 we are reporting closed sales net of a 50 allowance adjustment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 we reported closed sales net of a 40 allowance adjustment consequently our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported we assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years actual data as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 closed sales were 2425 million and 2389 million respectively the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 are net of an allowance adjustment of 128 million and 100 million respectively 

recent developments 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a pandemic which continues to persist throughout the world including the us india canada europe and other locations where we operate to date the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy created significant financial market volatility disrupted global supply chains and resulted in a significant number of deaths and infections worldwide in response several countries worldwide have enacted fiscal stimulus packages while central banks have increased monetary stimulus both designed to help mitigate the negative macroeconomic effects of covid19 in addition several national state and local governments have placed restrictions on people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance ie social distancing and in certain cases have ordered businesses to close limit operations or mandate that people stay at home 

the company’s operations both our investor communication solutions and global technology and operations segments are critical components of the overall financial markets infrastructure in the us and globally as a result we have been permitted to continue operating in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business in most cases remotely including in jurisdictions that have mandated the closure of certain businesses accordingly the company has taken several measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients from the covid19 pandemic including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities taking the temperature of productionrelated employees in affected areas on a daily basis as a prerequisite to entering our facilities load balancing of client jobs between various facilities and instituting work from home protocols for employees not involved in production operations amongst other measures 

in fiscal year 2021 there has not been a material impact as a result of covid19 on our consolidated revenues and pretax income in addition all of our productionrelated facilities remain operational and are continuing to provide ongoing services to our clients further we have not experienced any significant supplychain issues as our critical vendors have also remained operational and continue to meet their ongoing service level requirements we continue to engage with our clients to assist with their service demands including our clients’ needs for any supplemental operational services andor changes to existing service requirements in response to the covid19 pandemic 

notwithstanding the foregoing we are unable to precisely predict the impact that covid19 will have in the future due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report given these uncertainties covid19 could disrupt the business of certain of our clients decrease our clients’ demand for our services impact our business operations and our ability to execute on our associated business strategies and initiatives and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations andor our financial condition in the future we will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 to our business consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

on august 5 2020 the sec proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchangetraded fund disclosure framework the “proposal” under the proposal fund companies would send investors streamlined annual and semiannual shareholder reports instead of longform shareholder reports the proposal would allow fund companies to send investors streamlined and tailored annual and semiannual shareholder reports instead of longform shareholder reports the proposal also would replace the requirement for funds to distribute an annual prospectus to existing shareholders and instead requires timely communication of material changes via supplemental communications adoption and implementation of the proposal as proposed could have an impact on our services business and financial results we will closely monitor and evaluate the progress of the proposal and its potential impact on our business please see our “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report

• recurring fee revenues increased 2967 million primarily by growth from 5pts of new business onboarding 3pts of internal growth and 2pts related to the impact of acquisitions internal growth of 3pts was driven by increased equity and interim positions in ics and primarily higher equity trade volumes in gto partially offset by lower interest rates on cash balances we hold for retirement accounts lower customer communication volumes and lower gto license revenues 

• eventdriven fee revenues increased 593 million due to increased equity contests and mutual fund proxy and other communications 

• distribution revenues increased 1041 million primarily from the increase in the volume of customer and regulatory communications as well as the mix of customer communication mailings 

total operating expenses operating expenses increased 4109 million or 11 to 43150 million from 39041 million as a result of an increase in both cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses 

• cost of revenues  the increase of 3056 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects i higher distribution expenses ii higher operating costs from acquisitions and related amortization expense and iii other higher operating expenses including compensation 

• selling general and administrative expenses  the increase of 1052 million in selling general and administrative expenses primarily reflects i spend on growth and other initiatives ii higher performancebased compensation and iii the impact of acquisitions 

operating income margin of 136 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 declined 20 bps from 138 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 partly due to higher acquisition amortization expenses and other acquisition related charges plus charges associated with real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses however adjusted operating income margin of 181 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 increased 60 bps on higher recurring fee revenues and higher eventdriven fee revenues from 175 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 which excludes acquisition amortization expense certain charges associated with real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses and certain other nongaap adjustments see “explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

interest expense net interest expenses net was 552 million a decrease of 35 million from 588 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 the decrease of 35 million was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense from lower average interest rates on borrowings

the increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 was driven by the reduced impact of discrete tax items 

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary component of “other” are certain gains losses corporate overhead expenses and nonoperating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments such as interest expense foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated operating and nonoperating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit

to minimize the companys foreign exchange risk associated with the itiviti acquisition net of acquisitionrelated costs and vi charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement that occurred in the prior year period 

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented in nongaap measures these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance depending on the period presented these adjusted measures exclude the impact of i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs iii ibm private cloud charges iv real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses v investment gain vi software charge vii gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument and viii gain on sale of a joint venture investment amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represent noncash amortization expenses associated with the company’s acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities ibm private cloud charges represent a charge on the hardware assets transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses represent costs associated with the companys real estate realignment initiative including lease exit and impairment charges and other facility exit costs as well as certain expenses associated with the covid19 pandemic investment gain represents a nonoperating noncash gain on a privately held investment software charge represents a charge related to an internal use software product that is no longer expected to be used gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument represents a nonoperating gain on a financial instrument designed to minimize the companys foreign exchange risk associated with the itiviti acquisition as well as certain other nonoperating financing costs associated with the itiviti acquisition gain on sale of a joint venture investment represents a nonoperating cash gain on the sale of one of the company’s joint venture investments 

we exclude acquisition and integration costs ibm private cloud charges real estate realignment and covid19 related expenses the investment gain the software charge the gain on acquisitionrelated financial instrument and the gain on sale of a joint venture investment from our adjusted operating income as applicable and other adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property as these noncash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the companys capital allocation decisions management compensation metrics or multiyear objectives furthermore management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets 

free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities plus proceeds from asset sales less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited 







a calculated using the gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude 169 million of excess tax benefits “etb” associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 and 156 million of etb associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 the tax impact of adjustments also excludes approximately 106 million of acquisition and integration costs for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 which are not taxdeductible for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share the same adjustments were made on a per share basis 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources

cash flows 

fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 418 million primarily reflects higher net earnings and higher cash provided by working capital partially offset by increased scaling of clientrelated platform implementation and development as compared to the prior year period 

the increase in cash used in investing activities of 22120 million primarily reflects higher acquisition spend in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior year period most notably the itiviti acquisition 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities of 17466 million primarily reflects higher borrowings net of repayments most notably to finance the itiviti acquisition

other commercial agreements 

certain of the company’s subsidiaries established unsecured uncommitted lines of credit with banks there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at june 30 2021 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

it is not the company’s business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company was not a party to any outstanding derivative financial instruments at june 30 2021 or june 30 2020 in connection with the itiviti acquisition in march 2021 the company entered into two derivative instruments designed to mitigate the company’s exposure to the impact of i changes in foreign exchange rates on the itiviti acquisition purchase consideration and ii changes in interest rates on the fiscal 2021 senior notes 

the company executed a forward foreign exchange derivative instrument “forward” with an aggregate notional amount of eur 1955 billion the forward acted as an economic hedge against the impact of changes in the euro on the company’s purchase consideration for the itiviti acquisition the company recorded changes in fair value of the forward as part of other nonoperating income expenses net in the consolidated statement of earnings in may 2021 the company settled the forward derivative for a cumulative pretax gain of 667 million 

also the company executed a forward treasury lock agreement “treasury lock” designated as a cash flow hedge in the aggregate notional amount of 10 billion to manage exposure to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate associated with the fiscal 2021 senior notes which were used to pay down a portion of the term credit agreement associated with the itiviti acquisition accordingly changes in the fair value of the treasury lock were recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss net each period up to when the treasury lock was settled in may 2021 the treasury lock was settled for a pretax loss of 110 million after which the final settlement loss will be reclassified into interest expense net ratably over the ten year term of the fiscal 2021 senior notes the expected amount of the existing loss that would be reclassified into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately 11 million 

in the normal course of business the company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the company’s products and services the company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2021 16578 million or 43 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 38876 million is based on floating interest rates our 16578 million in variable rate debt at june 30 2021 consists of our revolving credit facility which depending on the currency of the loan bears interest at libor cdor euribor tibor and stibor plus 1015 per annum subject to stepups to 1175 and stepdowns to 0805 based on ratings or sonia plus 10476 per annum subject to stepups to 12076 and stepdowns to 08376 based on ratings plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 110 basis points on the entire facility subject to stepups to 200 basis points and stepdowns to 70 basis points based on ratings and the outstanding portion of our fiscal 2021 term loans which bears interest at libor plus 0875 per annum subject to stepups to libor plus 1250 or a stepdown to libor plus 0750 based on ratings we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility and fiscal 2021 term loans during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 however this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 12 of our fiscal year 2021 revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 40 of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2021 resided in our foreign subsidiaries our revenue generating operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus revenue generating operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 167 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2021 would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 967 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

the investor communication solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 77 and 80 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar see “analysis of reportable segments — revenues” under “item 701 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the services and solutions provided through our investor communication solutions segment serve the following client groups 

banksbrokerdealers 

we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank and brokerdealer clients we offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on the internet email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting over the internet mobile devices and tablets we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies with the ability to process proxy voting in over 120 international markets 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and shareholdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank as dtcc’s role is only as the custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for both nominees and companies a large number of nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority the nominee receives from the dtcc via an omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner with respect to companies as it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

the sec rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from corporate issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to thirdparty intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process 

we provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage the entire proxy voting process including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs proxyedge is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy voting can be instructed for the entire position by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers proxyedge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting proxyedge can be utilized for meetings of us and canadian companies and for meetings in many nonnorth american countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients proxyedge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 5600 proxyedge users worldwide

privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals federal and state regulators and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain personal information privacy laws outside the us may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than us laws and regulations and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation regulations and enforcement activity intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy we and certain of our affiliates are certified under the euus and swissus privacy shield framework which provides a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the european union and switzerland to the us as a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ftc with respect to its enforcement of the privacy shield framework 

the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the european union parliament adopted the comprehensive general data protection regulation “gdpr” that became effective in may 2018 t he california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective as of january 2020 creates new individual privacy rights for california consumers and places additional privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households we have been following the ccpa and its developments including recent amendments the release of proposed regulations and the new ccpa ballot initiative scheduled for some time in the future in our role as a service provider under ccpa we help facilitate clients in their compliance obligations in addition to confirming compliance by our own vendors 

we continually monitor the privacy and information security laws and regulations and w hile we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation

compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations these laws and regulations include import and export requirements trade restrictions and embargoes data privacy requirements labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements such as the uk bribery act although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations particularly as we expand our operations including through acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also damage our reputation our international expansion efforts and our business and negatively impact our operating results 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter beginning on july 1 2018 the company adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” and its related amendments collectively “asu no 201409” resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth fiscal quarters notwithstanding the impact of asu no 201409 the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

employees 

at june 30 2020 we had over 12000 employees none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company we believe that our employee relations are good 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the most significant factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the current covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial performance 

the current covid19 pandemic is having a significant effect on the world economy which has created significant uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy our employees our clients and our thirdparty service providers and the general impact of recession in the us the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and business and economic disruption any of the following factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could negatively affect our operations and performance of our services increase our costs and negatively impact our sales results of operations and our liquidity position possibly to a significant degree 

• the covid19 pandemic and the stayathome orders and quarantine rules resulting from the pandemic have had an impact on our ability to perform our services and the operations of our facilities our ability to provide our services and solutions could continue to be negatively impacted including as a result of our employees or our clients’ and vendors’ employees working remotely or due to business slowdown or interruption caused by the illness of our employees or the safety measures implemented to prevent the illness of our employees such as the potential closures of offices and facilities in addition a resurgence of the covid19 virus in the areas where we operate could result in additional stayathome orders being put in place our inability or failure to properly perform our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

• we have taken several measures in response to covid19 including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities taking the temperature of productionrelated employees in affected areas and instituting remote work for many of our employees we may take further actions in our facilities as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees clients and vendors there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 or will be satisfactory to government authorities 

• we are a global company and our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers particularly in north america the current pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity in many countries including the us and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets an extended period of market disruption or closures or a prolonged economic downturn including whether there is a resurgence or second wave of infections could negatively impact our business and financial results we have experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our services and a delay or reduction in our sales which could continue if the economic downturn is prolonged or it causes financial stress for our clients we could also experience a delay in onboarding our clients further the decline in market activity has resulted in decreased assets under administration negatively impacting our mutual fund processing business in addition lower interest rates have negatively impacted our mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses 

• the technological resources and infrastructure used by us as well as the thirdparty service providers and vendors who support us such as internet capacity may be strained due to the increase in the number of remote users in addition we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of employees who are working remotely in regions impacted by stayathome orders or observing quarantine safety measures increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family and work responsibilities at home 

• we rely on thirdparty service providers and vendors to provide critical systems and services such as data center services and materials needed for the production and delivery of our print services and the covid19 pandemic could present heightened or novel risks with respect to the continuity of our critical vendors’ services or ability to supply materials including the possibility of closure or business interruption 

• there is a potential risk that members of our senior management team andor our board of directors could become incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time due to illness resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the covid19 pandemic and as a result its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy and the full impact will depend on numerous evolving factors that are outside our control however the effects could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial performance 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2020 we derived approximately 20  of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 52 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2020 while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client we would be required to writeoff any investments made by us in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 9 of our total assets as of june 30 2020 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare companies we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks 

in certain circumstances our thirdparty vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information it is also possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information we require our thirdparty vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced nonmaterial cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services such as our proxy and shareholder report distribution and processing and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets 

our services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable sec or stock exchange rules or regulations are amended or new laws or regulations are adopted which could result in a negative impact on our business and financial results 

in addition new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less 

profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business further as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

in addition in connection with the offering of cits matrix trust acts as a discretionary trustee and erisa fiduciary erisa and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa as a result we may face the risk of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings resulting from a breach of matrix trust’s fiduciary responsibilities 

for a description of the aspects of our business that are subject to regulatory compliance or oversight please refer to part i “item 1 business  regulation” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the glba hipaa the ccpa and the gdpr in the eu and we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

for a description of privacy and information security regulations affecting us please refer to part i “item 1 business  regulations  privacy and information security regulations” of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

our ability to comply with regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes in addition our eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

we rely on relationships with third parties including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty vendors operate our financial results or reputation could suffer we rely on these third parties including our data center and cloud services providers to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own cybersecurity risks failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

certain of our businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in such circumstances we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key thirdparty vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given among other reasons the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our providers the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally 

if we change a significant vendor an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations or is acquired or we seek to bring inhouse certain services performed today by third parties we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

furthermore certain thirdparty services providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients it is possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other thirdparty carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and thirdparty carriers including the united parcel service for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather increased fuel costs and suspension of delivery of communications to certain countries as a result of the covid19 pandemic any failure to deliver communications to or on behalf of our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery causing disruptions in the service if our relationship with any of these thirdparty carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack pandemic or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems our systems those of our data center and cloud services providers or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

• computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems 

• direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks 

• inability to rapidly monitor all system activity 

• inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected 

• heavy stress placed on systems during peak times or due to high volumes or volatility or 

• power or telecommunications failure fire flood pandemic or any other disaster 

while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations and use thirdparty cloud services for storage of certain data the operation performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

the inability to properly perform our services or operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the inability or the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition the inability to properly perform our services or errors in the performance of our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

our services are impacted by the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets these factors are in turn affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets for example the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to a general economic recession adversely impacting our clients and the markets these factors include 

• economic political and market conditions 

• legislative and regulatory changes 

• the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital 

• the level and volatility of interest rates 

• currency values and inflation 

• financial wellbeing of our clients and 

• national state and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients or adapt to technological changes or advances our business and future growth could be impacted 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on thirdparty service providers such as our cloud services provider 

in addition we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients and harm our business and impact our future growth 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 13 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if in response to a thirdparty infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such thirdparty’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies technologies or products or enter joint ventures these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

• valuation finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews 

• integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets and converting their financial information security privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition and 

• legacy issues protecting against actions claims regulatory investigations losses and other liabilities related to the predecessor business 

also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

• finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms 

• competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors 

• incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions 

• devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business 

• borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us 

• loss of clients of the acquired business 

• entering markets where we have minimal prior experience and 

• experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of noncash impairment charges 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• enforcing intellectual property rights in some nonus countries and 

• general economic and political conditions 

we may incur noncash goodwill impairment charges in the future 

as a result of past acquisitions we carry a significant goodwill balance on our balance sheet goodwill accounted for approximately 34 of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30 2020 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which will likely result in our recognition of additional goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31st and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable although no indications of a goodwill impairment have been identified there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future particularly in the event of a prolonged economic recession a significant noncash goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies 

for example the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” became effective on january 31 2020 a transition period will apply until the end of 2020 or later if extended during which the prebrexit legal regime will continue to apply while the united kingdom and european union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship it is unknown how that future relationship will be structured which is likely to lead to differing laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union and further global economic trade and regulatory uncertainty this continued uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal has caused and may continue to cause economic uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting in a decline in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar brexit may also negatively impact our clients with operations in the united kingdom which may cause them to reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies this causes our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

 item 2 properties 

we operate our business primarily from 69 facilities we lease three facilities in edgewood new york and facilities in el dorado hills california south windsor connecticut kansas city missouri coppell texas and markham canada with a combined space of 22 million square feet which are used in connection with our investor communication solutions business we also lease a facility in newark new jersey which houses our principal global technology and operations business operations we also lease space at 60 additional locations subject to customary lease arrangements our leases expire on a staggered basis we believe our facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business the company is subject to claims and litigation while the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable the company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not individually or in the aggregate result in a material impact on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows

dividend policy 

we expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock on august 10 2020 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 0035 per share to 0575 per share an increase in our expected annual dividend amount from 216 to 230 per share the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings capital requirements of our businesses legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant 

as a holding company substantially all our assets being comprised of the capital stock of our subsidiaries our ability to pay dividends will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries our subsidiaries through which we provide our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are regulated and may be subject to restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us we do not believe that these restrictions are significant enough to impact the company’s ability to pay dividends

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the us and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10k these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and nonmarketable securities intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable except as it relates to i asu no 201602 as amended “leases” “asu no 201602” ii asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu no 201409” iii asu no 201601 “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” “asu no 201601” and iv asu no 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” “asu no 201802” as described further below 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

effective july 1 2019 the company adopted asu no 201602 “leases” and its related amendments collectively referred to as “asu 201602 as amended” by recognizing a rou asset and corresponding lease liability along with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption under this method of adoption the company has not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation additional information about the impact of the companys adoption of asu no 201602 as amended is included in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 8 “leases” to the consolidated financial statements 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201409 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts under this transition approach we have not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation additional information about the company’s revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of asu no 201409 is included in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 “revenue recognition” 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201601 which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of net earnings rather than as other comprehensive income loss net in addition equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer we adopted asu no 201601 using the modifiedretrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of july 1 2018 the provisions of asu no 201601 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively the consolidated financial statements have not been revised for periods prior to july 1 2018 the impact of adopting asu no 201601 resulted in a reclassification of less than 01 million in unrealized gains net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of july 1 2018 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201802 which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the us federal corporate tax rate resulting from the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” enacted in december 2017 the adoption of asu no 201802 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of 15 million 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201707 “improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost” “asu no 201707” whereby we revised its presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to reflect the nonservice cost components of net benefit cost as part of other nonoperating income expenses net which were previously recorded as part of total operating expenses all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process 

changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we had 16745 million of goodwill as of june 30 2020 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 131 million as of june 30 2020 of which 15 million are subject to expiration in the june 30 2020 through june 30 2028 period the remaining 116 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 370 million of which 169 million can be utilized through june 30 2030 with the balance of 202 million having an indefinite utilization period us federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the tax act the company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 67 million and 33 million at june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

on the same date that the tax act was enacted december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provided the company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the tax act under sab 118 the company finalized the prior year estimate of the net tax impact to the company arising from the enactment of the tax act and recognized a tax benefit of approximately 05 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

sharebased payments  accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a 24 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a 08 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield 

assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a 09 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

key performance indicators 

management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan measure and evaluate the company’s business and financial performance these performance indicators include revenue and recurring fee revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” of adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and closed sales in addition management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth as defined below 

refer to the section “explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measures and an explanation for why these nongaap metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these nongaap metrics for operational and financial decisionmaking refer to the section “results of operations” for a description of closed sales and an explanation of why closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors 

revenues 

revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technologyenabled services and solutions the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs fee revenues are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity the level of recurring and eventdriven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

recurring fee revenue growth represents the company’s total annual fee revenue growth less growth from eventdriven fee revenues we distinguish recurring fee revenue growth between organic and acquired 

• organic – we define organic revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from net new business and internal growth 

• acquired – we define acquired revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase integrate and leverage the value of assets we acquire 

revenues and recurring fee revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company’s ongoing operational performance see “results of operations” as well as note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

record growth and internal trade growth 

the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business record growth is defined as stock record growth and interim record growth which measure the estimated annual change in total positions eligible for equity proxy materials and mutual fund and exchange traded fund interim communications respectively for equities and mutual fund position data reported to broadridge in both the current and prior year periods internal trade growth represents the estimated change in trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods record growth and internal trade growth are useful nonfinancial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments respectively 

the key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 is disclosed in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the 2019 annual report 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property” and “acquisition and integration costs” represent certain noncash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities respectively 

“ibm private cloud charges” represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement 

“gain on sale of a joint venture investment” represents a nonoperating cash gain on the sale of one of the company’s joint venture investments 

“covid19 related expenses” represents certain nonrecurring expenses associated with the covid19 pandemic 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

• mutual fund proxy the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors subadvisors fee structures investment restrictions and mergers of funds 

• mutual fund communications mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers in addition mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters 

• proxy contests and specials corporate actions and other the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests mergers and acquisitions and tenderexchange offers 

eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2020 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 35 lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2019 mutual fund proxy revenues were 14 lower than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment for fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 we are reporting closed sales net of a 40 allowance adjustment consequently our reported closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported we assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 closed sales were 2389 million and 2333 million respectively the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 are net of an allowance adjustment of 100 million and 97 million respectively 

recent developments 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the world including the us india canada europe and other locations where we operate developments have occurred rapidly with respect to the spread of covid19 and its impact on human health and businesses to date the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy created significant financial market volatility disrupted global supply chains and resulted in a significant number of deaths and infections worldwide in response several countries worldwide enacted fiscal stimulus packages while central banks increased monetary stimulus both designed to help mitigate the negative macroeconomic effects of covid19 in addition several national state and local governments have placed restrictions on people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance ie social distancing and in certain cases have ordered businesses to close limit operations or mandate that people stay at home 

the company’s operations both our investor communication solutions and global technology and operations segments are critical components of the overall financial markets infrastructure in the us and globally as a result we have been permitted to continue operating in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business in most cases remotely including in jurisdictions that have mandated the closure of certain businesses accordingly the company has taken several measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients from the covid19 pandemic including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities taking the temperature of productionrelated employees in affected areas on a daily basis as a prerequisite to entering our facilities load balancing of client jobs between various facilities and instituting work from home protocols for employees not involved in production operations amongst other measures 

to date there has not been a material impact as a result of covid19 on our consolidated revenues and pretax income the company processed above average levels of equity and fixed income trades in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 for our financial services clients many of whom themselves have experienced higher levels of trading activity from market volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic partially offset by lower internal growth in certain aspects of our investor communication solutions business in addition all of our productionrelated facilities remain operational and are continuing to provide ongoing services to our clients further we have not experienced any significant supplychain issues as our critical vendors have also remained operational and continue to meet their ongoing service level requirements we continue to actively engage with our clients to assist with their service demands including our clients’ needs for any supplemental operational services andor changes to existing service requirements in response to the covid19 pandemic 

notwithstanding the foregoing we are unable to precisely predict the impact that covid19 will have in the future due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k given these uncertainties covid19 could disrupt the business of certain of our clients decrease our clients’ demand for our services impact our business operations and our ability to execute on our associated business strategies and initiatives and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations andor our financial condition in the future we will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 to our business consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

on august 5 2020 the sec proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchangetraded fund disclosure framework the “fund disclosure proposal” the fund disclosure proposal is intended to provide a disclosure framework that would better serve the needs of retail investors among the modifications proposed are the requirement for streamlined shareholder reports with concise and visually engaging content which would replace prospectus updates and improvements to prospectus disclosure adoption and implementation of the fund disclosure proposal amendments as proposed could have an impact on our services business and financial results we will closely monitor and evaluate the progress of the fund disclosure proposal and its potential impact on our business please see our “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k for more information

total operating expenses operating expenses increased 1947 million or 5 to 39041 million from 37095 million as a result of 

• cost of revenues  the increase of 1332 million in cost of revenues primarily reflected higher operating costs from acquisitions and related amortization expense and charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement partially offset by certain lower operational expenses

• currencies positively impacted total operating expenses by 313 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies and continued international operating expense growth 

operating income margin of 138 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 declined 120 bps from 150 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 partly due to charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement however adjusted operating income margin of 175 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 increased 40 bps on higher recurring revenues from 171 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 which excludes certain charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement and certain other nongaap adjustments see “explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

interest expense net interest expenses net was 588 million an increase of 170 million from 418 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 the increase of 170 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowings primarily related to acquisitions

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary component of “other” are certain gains losses corporate overhead expenses and nonoperating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments such as interest expense foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated operating and nonoperating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit 

in connection with an organizational change made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services the results for the company’s wealth management advisor solutions services that were previously reported in our investor communication solutions reportable segment are now reported within the global technology and operations reportable segment as a result our prior period segment results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 have been revised to reflect this change which resulted in transferring 428 million of revenues and 22 million of earnings before income taxes between reportable segments respectively

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented in nongaap measures these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs iii ibm private cloud charges iv the gain on sale of a joint venture investment and v covid19 related expenses amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents noncash amortization expenses associated with the companys acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities ibm private cloud charges represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement the gain on sale of a joint venture investment represents a nonoperating cash gain on the sale of one of the company’s joint venture investments covid19 related expenses represents certain nonrecurring expenses associated with the covid19 pandemic 

we exclude ibm private cloud charges gain on sale of a joint venture investment and covid19 related expenses from our adjusted operating income and other earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property as these noncash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the companys capital allocation decisions management compensation metrics or multiyear objectives furthermore management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets 

free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited 







a calculated using the gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude 156 million of excess tax benefits “etb” associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 and 193 million of etb associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share the same adjustments were made on a per share basis 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following 



at june 30 2020 and 2019 cash and cash equivalents were 4766 million and 2732 million respectively total stockholders’ equity was 13465 million and 11275 million at june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively at the current time and in future periods we expect cash generated by our operations together with existing cash cash equivalents and borrowings from the capital markets to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital capital expenditures strategic acquisitions dividends and common stock repurchases given the volatility in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial position 

we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds however while we may do so at a future date the company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund us operations 

outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows 



 

a the fiscal 2014 senior notes were reclassified from longterm debt to current portion of longterm debt in september 2019 to reflect the remaining maturity of less than a year 

future principal payments on the company’s outstanding debt are as follows 



the company has a 15 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility the “fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility” which is comprised of a 11 billion us dollar tranche and a 4000 million multicurrency tranche borrowings under the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 1015 basis points in addition the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility has an annual facility fee equal to 110 basis points on the entire facility 

the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on march 1 st and september 1 st of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 395 interest on the senior notes due june 2026 is payable semiannually on june 27 th and december 27 th of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 340 interest on the senior notes due 2029 is payable semiannually on june 1st and december 1st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 290 

our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios 

please refer to note 13 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 



the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 187 million primarily reflects increased scaling of clientrelated platform implementation and development partially offset by cash flows from higher revenues cash collections and working capital 

the increase in cash used in investing activities of 81 million primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures and software purchases partially offset by lower acquisition spend in fiscal year 2020 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities of 2243 million primarily reflects a decrease in the repurchase of common stock partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings and an increase in dividends paid

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2020 1498 million or 8 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 17875 million is based on floating interest rates our 1498 million in variable rate debt at june 30 2020 consists of our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 1015 basis points on borrowed amounts plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 110 basis points on the entire facility we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 58 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 however this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 12 of our fiscal year 2020 revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 23 of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2020 resided in our foreign subsidiaries our revenue generating operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus revenue generating operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 131 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2020 would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 843 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

the investor communication solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 80 and 81 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the united states of america “us” dollar see “analysis of reportable segments—revenues” under “item 701 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the services and solutions provided through our investor communication solutions segment serve the following client groups 

banksbrokerdealers 

we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank and brokerdealer clients we offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on the internet email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting over the internet mobile devices and tablets we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies with the ability to process proxy voting in over 120 international markets 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and shareholdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank as dtcc’s role is only as the custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for both nominees and companies a large number of nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority the nominee receives from the dtcc via an omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner with respect to companies as it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

the securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from corporate issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to thirdparty intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process 

we provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage the entire proxy voting process including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs proxyedge is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy voting can be instructed for the entire position by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers proxyedge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting proxyedge can be utilized for meetings of us and canadian companies and for meetings in many nonnorth american countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients proxyedge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 5600 proxyedge users worldwide

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide certain of our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the access collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act in addition to other regulations as a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with privacy regulations and are bound by similar limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves we also perform services for healthcare companies and are therefore subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information including in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” we also perform creditrelated services and agree to comply with payment card standards including the payment card industry data security standard “pcidss” in addition federal and state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply to our businesses 

privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals federal and state regulators and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain personal information privacy laws outside the us may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than us laws and regulations and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the european union parliament adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” that became effective in may 2018 while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

legal compliance 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs sanctions lists and specially designated nationals and blocked persons list for example individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations these laws and regulations include import and export requirements trade restrictions and embargoes data privacy requirements labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements such as the uk bribery act although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions including acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with us and other laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also damage our reputation our international expansion efforts and our business and negatively impact our operating results 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter beginning on july 1 2018 the company adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” and its related amendments collectively “asu no 201409” resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth fiscal quarters notwithstanding the impact of asu no 201409 the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2019 we derived approximately 22 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 55 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2019 while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 7 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2019 

under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare providers we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks 

in certain circumstances our thirdparty vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information it is also possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information we require our thirdparty vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced nonmaterial cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services such as our proxy and shareholder report distribution and processing and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets 

our services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable sec or exchange laws or regulations are amended or new laws or regulations are adopted which could result in a negative impact on our business and financial results 

in addition new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy disaster recovery information security and thirdparty vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo an sec registered brokerdealer and a member of finra bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censures fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors officers or employees our transfer agency business is subject to sec nyse and other federal and state laws and regulations 

as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients for example the european union parliament adopted the gdpr which is a comprehensive data privacy regulation that became effective in may 2018 the gdpr imposes additional obligations and risks upon our businesses including the risk of substantially increased penalties for noncompliance while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

our ability to comply with regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes in addition our eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

we rely on relationships with third parties including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty vendors operate our financial results or reputation could suffer we rely on these third parties including our data center and cloud services providers to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own cybersecurity risks failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

certain of the company’s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in such circumstances we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key thirdparty vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given among other reasons the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our providers the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally 

if we change a significant vendor an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations or is acquired or we seek to bring inhouse certain services performed today by third parties we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

furthermore certain thirdparty services providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients it is possible that a thirdparty vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other thirdparty carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and thirdparty carriers including ups for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather and increased fuel costs any failure to deliver communications to our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery if our relationship with any of these thirdparty carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems our systems those of our data center and cloud services providers or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations and use thirdparty cloud services for storage of certain data the operation performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to incur expenses lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 



 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients or adapt to technological changes or advances our business and future growth could be impacted 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on thirdparty service providers such as our cloud services provider 

in addition we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients and harm our business and impact our future growth 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if in response to a thirdparty infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such thirdparty’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies technologies or products or enter joint ventures these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 



 

also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

we may incur noncash goodwill impairment charges in the future 

as a result of past acquisitions we carry a significant goodwill balance on our balance sheet goodwill accounted for approximately 39 of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30 2019 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which will likely result in our recognition of additional goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31st and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable although no indications of a goodwill impairment have been identified there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future particularly in the event of a prolonged economic slowdown a significant noncash goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies for example the united kingdom’s potential withdrawal from the european union “brexit” and the continued uncertainty surrounding the potential timing of such withdrawal has caused and may continue to cause economic uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting in a decline in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar brexit may also negatively impact our clients with operations in the united kingdom which may cause them to reduce their spending on our solutions and services in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter beginning on july 1 2019 the company adopted asu no 201409 resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth fiscal quarters notwithstanding the impact of asu no 201409 the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the us and in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” requirements for annual reports on form 10k these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and nonmarketable securities intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation except as it relates to i asu no 201409 ii asu no 201601 “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities “asu no 201601” iii asu no 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” “asu no 201802” and iv asu no 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu no 201609” as described further below 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201409 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts under this transition approach we have not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation however we have provided additional disclosures related to the amount by which each relevant fiscal 2019 financial statement line item was affected by the adoption of asu no 201409 along with explanations for significant changes additional information about the company’s revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of asu no 201409 is included in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 “revenue recognition” 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201601 which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of net earnings rather than as other comprehensive income loss net in addition equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer we adopted asu no 201601 using the modifiedretrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of july 1 2018 the provisions of asu no 201601 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively the consolidated financial statements have not been revised for periods prior to july 1 2018 the impact of adopting asu no 201601 resulted in a reclassification of less than 01 million in unrealized gains net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of july 1 2018 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201802 which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the us federal corporate tax rate resulting from the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” enacted in december 2017 the adoption of asu no 201802 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of 15 million 

effective july 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201707 “improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost” “asu no 201707” whereby we revised its presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to reflect the nonservice cost components of net benefit cost as part of other nonoperating income expenses net which were previously recorded as part of total operating expenses all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation 

effective july 1 2017 we adopted asu no 201609 which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including presenting the excess tax benefits “etb” or deficits from the exercise or vesting of sharebased payments in the income statement classifying the etb or deficits as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows rather than as a financing activity a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stockbased compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur in addition asu no 201609 eliminates the etb from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares as a result of this adoption we recorded etb related to stockbased compensation awards of 193 million an d 409 million during the twelve months ended june 30 2019 and 2018 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis whereas such benefits would previously have been recognized in equity we also excluded the etb from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 and 2018 we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for etb in the consolidated financial statements we also elected to apply the change in presentation of etb in the consolidated statement of cash flows prospectively and as a result etb are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments this adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of 193 million a nd 409 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 and 2018 we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of etb on the consolidated statement of cash flows we also elected to continue our current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by asu no 201609 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we had 15000 million of goodwill as of june 30 2019  given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 95 million as of june 30 2019 of which 15 million are subject to expiration in the 2020 through 2028 period the remaining 80 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 186 million which can be utilized through 2030 us federal net operating loss 

carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the tax act the company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 33 million and 38 million at june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

on the same date that the tax act was enacted december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provided the company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the tax act under sab 118 the company finalized the prior year estimate of the net tax impact to the company arising from the enactment of the tax act and recognized a tax benefit of approximately 05 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

sharebased payments  accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a 21 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a 08 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a 09 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 is disclosed in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the 2018 annual report 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property” and “acquisition and integration costs” represent certain noncash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities respectively 

“gain on sale of securities” represents a nonoperating gain on the sale of securities associated with our retirement plan obligations 

“tax act items” represent a us federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for us tax purposes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company’s net us federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast during the three months ended december 31 2018 we were initially able to separate certain annually recurring mutual fund related communications that were previously included in eventdriven fee revenues these activities were presented within recurring fee revenues commencing in the three months ended december 31 2018 we were not able to reliably estimate the portion of eventdriven fee revenues attributable to these activities in prior periods we added approximately 12 million to recurring fee revenues for the year ended june 30 2019 and is captured within recurring fee revenues internal growth 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2019  mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 14 lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2018 mutual fund proxy revenues were 28 higher than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment for fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018 we are reporting closed sales net of a 40 allowance adjustment consequently our reported closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported we assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018  closed sales were 2333 million and 2149 million  respectively the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018  are net of an allowance adjustment of 97 million and 90 million  respectively 

analysis of consolidated statements of earnings 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

the table below presents consolidated statements of earnings data for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018  and the dollar and percentage changes between periods 



revenues 

revenues increased 323 million  or 1 to 43622 million from 43299 million as a result of 





total operating expenses operating expenses decreased 223 million or 1 to 37095 million from 37318 million as a result of 

 operating income operating income margins increased to 150 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to 138 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  primarily due to the increase in recurring fee revenues 

interest expense net interest expenses net was 418 million an increase of 32 million from 386 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 the increase of 32 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense primarily due to higher borrowing costs partially offset by an increase in interest income 

other nonoperating income expenses net other nonoperating income net for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 was 37 million a decrease of 52 million compared to 15 million of other nonoperating expenses net for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 the decrease of 52 million was primarily due to higher expense related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a decrease due to lower investment gains and higher losses related to minority equity investments 

provision for income taxes  

 the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 is primarily due to i the us federal corporate income tax rate change from 35 to 21 under the tax act which resulted in a blended us federal corporate income tax rate of 281 for the prior year and a 21 tax rate for the current year and ii the company accrued a onetime net expense of approximately 154 million to reflect a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2017 partially offset by a benefit related to the remeasurement of the company’s net us federal and state deferred tax liabilities for which this expense did not recur in the current year partially offset by iii the recognition of 193 million in etb attributable to stockbased compensation compared to a 409 million etb in the prior year 

asc 606 revenue accounting change for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 if the prior year basis of revenue accounting followed the current year basis of revenue accounting 



analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary component of “other” are certain gains losses corporate overhead expenses and nonoperating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments such as interest expense foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated operating and nonoperating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs iii tax act items and iv the gain on sale of securities amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents noncash amortization expenses associated with the companys acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities tax act items represent the net impact of a us federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company’s net us federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the tax act the gain on sale of securities represents a nonoperating gain on the sale of securities associated with the company’s retirement plan obligations 

we exclude tax act items and gain on sale of securities from our adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property as these noncash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the companys capital allocation decisions management compensation metrics or multiyear objectives furthermore management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets 

free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited 







a calculated using the gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude 193 million of etb associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 and 409 million of etb associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 as well as the net 154 million charges associated with the tax act for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share the same adjustments were made on a per share basis 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following 

at june 30 2019 and 2018  cash and cash equivalents were 2732 million and 2639 million  respectively total stockholders’ equity was 11275 million and 10943 million at june 30 2019 and 2018  respectively at june 30 2019  net working capital was 2398 million compared to 2138 million at june 30 2018  at the current time and in future periods we expect cash generated by our operations together with existing cash cash equivalents and borrowing capacity to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital capital expenditures strategic acquisitions dividends and common stock repurchases 

at june 30 2019  998 million of the 2732 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries and 779 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds however while we may do so at a future date the company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund us operations 

outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows 



future principal payments on the company’s outstanding debt are as follows

at june 30 2019  the carrying value of the company’s outstanding longterm debt was 14704 million  consisting of i borrowings on the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility of 5757 million  ii senior notes of 3992 million  4000 million principal amount less 01 million of unamortized bond discount and 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs due september 2020 and iii senior notes of 4955 million  5000 million principal amount less 15 million of unamortized bond discount and 30 million of unamortized debt issuance costs due june 2026  the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on march 1 st and september 1 st of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 395 interest on the senior notes due june 2026 is payable semiannually on june 27 th and december 27 th of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 340 

our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios 

please refer to note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 



the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 766 million primarily reflects i an increase in cash used in client implementations and related client contract payments and ii an increase in cash used in working capital partially offset by iii an increase in net earnings 

the increase in cash used in investing activities of 1843 million primarily reflects i increased acquisitions driven primarily by the acquisition of rpm in fiscal year 2019 partially offset by ii lower purchases of intellectual property 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities of 2768 million primarily reflects i an increase in net proceeds from borrowings partially offset by ii an increase in the repurchase of common stock and iii an increase in dividends paid

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2019  5757 million  or 39 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 14704 million is based on floating interest rates our 5757 million in variable rate debt at june 30 2019 consists of our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 1015 basis points on borrowed amounts plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 110 basis points on the entire facility we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 33 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  however this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 10 of our fiscal year 2019 revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 26 of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2019 resided in our foreign subsidiaries our revenue generating operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus revenue generating operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 122 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2019 would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 762 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and shareholdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions a large number of nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering agreements with us and by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials and that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations in addition we take on the responsibility of ensuring that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue because it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide certain of our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the access collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act in addition to other regulations as a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with privacy regulations and are bound by similar limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves we also perform services for healthcare companies and are therefore subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information including in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” we also perform creditrelated services and agree to comply with payment card standards including the payment card industry data security standard “pcidss” in addition federal and state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply to our businesses 

privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals federal and state regulators and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain personal information privacy laws outside the us may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than us laws and regulations and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” that became effective in may 2018 while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

legal compliance 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs sanctions lists and specially designated nationals and blocked persons list for example individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations these laws and regulations include import and export requirements trade restrictions and embargoes data privacy requirements labor laws tax laws anticompetition regulations us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements such as the uk bribery act although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions including acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with us and other laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also damage our reputation our international expansion efforts and our business and negatively impact our operating results 

  

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter beginning in fiscal year 2019 the company will adopt asu 201409 resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth quarters notwithstanding the impact of asu 201409 the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

employees 

at june 30 2018  we had over 10000 employees none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2018 we derived approximately 21 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 55 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 6 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2018 

under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare providers we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks 

in certain circumstances our third party vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information it is also possible that a third party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information we require our third party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and in turn adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services including our proxy processing and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets in addition we perform services for clients in the healthcare insurance and telecommunications industries which are also highly regulated 

changes in laws and regulations may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business also changes in regulations could change the quantity or format of or eliminate the need for certain types of communications and our related services further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses and new laws or regulations andor changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy disaster recovery information security and third party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo an sec registered brokerdealer and a member of finra bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censures fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors officers or employees our transfer agency business is subject to sec nyse and other federal and state laws and regulations 

our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data 

protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the gdpr that came into effect in the european union in may 2018 may cause the company to incur additional compliance costs while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we may be adversely impacted by a failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

we rely on relationships with third parties including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our thirdparty vendors operate our financial results or reputation could suffer failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services in a timely and accurate manner could result in material interruptions in our operations and impact our services 

certain of the company’s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we cannot be certain that we could replace our key thirdparty vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given among other reasons the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our providers the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally if we change a significant vendor an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations or is acquired or we seek to bring in house certain services performed today by third parties we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

furthermore certain third party services providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients it is possible that a third party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other third party carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and third party carriers including fedex and ups for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather and increased fuel costs any failure to deliver communications to our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery if our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems our systems those of our data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients or adapt to technological changes or advances our business and future growth could be impacted 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

in addition we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients and harm our business and impact our future growth 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights if in response to a third party infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such third party’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies technologies or products or enter joint ventures these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

we may incur noncash goodwill impairment charges in the future 

as a result of past acquisitions we carry a significant goodwill balance on our balance sheet goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization together accounted for approximately 53 of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30 2018 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31 st  and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable although no indications of a goodwill impairment have been identified there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future particularly in the event of a prolonged economic slowdown a significant noncash goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter beginning in fiscal year 2019 the company will adopt asu 201409 resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth quarters notwithstanding the impact of asu 201409 the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america “us” these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 we adopted asu no 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu no 201609” asu no 201609 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including presenting the excess tax benefits or deficits from the exercise or vesting of sharebased payments in the income statement classifying the excess tax benefits or deficits as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows rather than as a financing activity a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stockbased compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur in addition asu no 201609 eliminates the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares as a result of this adoption we recorded excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation awards of 409 million during the twelve months ended june 30 2018 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis whereas such benefits would previously have been recognized in equity we also excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for excess tax benefits in the consolidated financial statements we also elected to apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits in the consolidated statement of cash flows prospectively and as a result excess tax benefits are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments this adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of 409 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of excess tax benefits on the consolidated statement of cash flows we also elected to continue our current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by asu no 201609 

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 we adopted asu no 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” “asu no 201507” on a prospective basis to all deferred tax liabilities and assets the amendments in asu no 201517 require entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount our fiscal year 2017 consolidated balance sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of asu no 201517 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill   we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible 

impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 12549 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2018  given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 152 million as of june 30 2018 of which 22 million are subject to expiration in the 2019 through 2027 period the remaining 130 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 225 million which can be utilized through 2030 and a 11 million capital loss carryforward which will expire 2023 since the us federal net operating loss carryforwards result from tax losses recognized prior to december 31 2017 they are not subject to the new provision in the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which provides for an indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 38 million and 93 million at june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the estimated incremental income tax expense related to the tax act reflects assumptions based upon our interpretation of the tax act the calculation of the estimated incremental income tax expense is based upon various estimates and assumptions and may be impacted by additional considerations including but not limited to the final computation of 2017 and 2018 earnings and profits and tax pools of nonus subsidiaries as of the relevant measurement dates the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to changes in our assumptions additional regulatory clarification and guidance that may be issued as well as the amount of our earnings before income taxes 

sharebased payments   accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility 

assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018  stock option grants would result in approximately a 42 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018  stock option grants would result in approximately a 17 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2018  stock option grants would result in approximately a 02 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2018  stock option grants would result in approximately a 19 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2018  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

“amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property” and “acquisition and integration costs” represent certain noncash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities respectively 

“mal investment gain” represents a noncash nontaxable gain on investment from the company’s acquisition of mal in march 2017 

“gain on sale of securities” represents a nonoperating gain on the sale of securities associated with our retirement plan obligations 

“tax act items” represent a us federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for us tax purposes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company’s net us federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations 

in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2018  mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 28 higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2017  and 2016  mutual fund proxy revenues were 19 higher and 22 lower than the prior fiscal year respectively although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

 the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2017 we tracked actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract was fully implemented and compared this to the previously reported closed sales amount this process was used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment 

beginning in the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 we reported closed sales net of a 35 allowance adjustment in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods for fiscal year 2018 we are reporting closed sales net of a 40 allowance adjustment consequently our reported closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported we assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017 and 2016 closed sales which includes contributions from nacc beginning in fiscal year 2017 were 2149 million  1885 million  and 1509 million  respectively the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  and 2017 are net of an allowance adjustment of 90 million  and 68 million  respectively

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary component of “other” are certain gains losses corporate overhead expenses and nonoperating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments such as interest expense foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated operating and nonoperating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit 

in connection with an organizational change made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services certain discrete services that were previously reported in our investor communication solutions reportable segment are now reported within the global technology and operations reportable segment as a result our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs iii tax act items iv the gain on sale of securities and v the mal investment gain amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents noncash amortization expenses associated with the companys acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities tax act items represent the net impact of a us federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company’s net us federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the tax act the gain on sale of securities represents a nonoperating gain on the sale of securities associated with the company’s retirement plan obligations the mal investment gain represents a noncash nontaxable gain on investment from the company’s acquisition of mal in march 2017 

we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property acquisition and integration costs tax act items gain on sale of securities and the mal investment gain from our earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings management believes these adjusted measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business 

free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited 







a calculated using the gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the net 154 million charges associated with the tax act as well as 409 million of excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share the same adjustments were made on a per share basis

future principal payments on the company’s outstanding debt are as follows 

the company has a 10 billion   five year revolving credit facility the “fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility” which is comprised of a 9000 million  us dollar tranche and a 1000 million  multicurrency tranche borrowings under the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 100 basis points  in addition the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility has an annual facility fee equal to 125 basis points  on the entire facility which totaled 13 million  and 11 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  and june 30 2017  respectively as of june 30 2018  the company had 1600 million

our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios

cash flows 

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017   



the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 1776 million  was due to i higher cash generated from our operations primarily from higher revenues partially offset by increased cash used in working capital ii an increase in cash provided by advanced client payments on existing contracts of 616 million and iii the classification of excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation awards as part of operating activities in fiscal year 2018 for which 406 million of excess tax benefits were classified in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 rather than operating activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities of 4101 million  primarily reflects decreased i acquisitions of 3404 million largely driven by the acquisition of nacc in fiscal year 2017 and ii 500 million in purchased intellectual property 

the increase in cash used in financing activities of 1382 million  primarily reflects i a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings of 1350 million ii a 406 million decrease in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stockbased compensation awards that are no longer classified as cash flows from financing activities iii a 136 million increase in dividends paid and iv a 89 million decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by v a 657 million decrease in the repurchase of common stock 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2018  1600 million  or 15 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 10534 million  is based on floating interest rates our 1600 million  in variable rate debt at june 30 2018  consists of our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 100 basis points on borrowed amounts plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 125 basis points on the entire facility we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 31 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  this however would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 10  of our fiscal year 2018  revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 19  of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2018  resided in our foreign subsidiaries our revenue generating operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus revenue generating operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 119 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2018  would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 453 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant 

brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering agreements with us and by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials and that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations in addition we take on the responsibility of ensuring that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue because it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers investment companies and financial advisors

the processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide certain of our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the access collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act in addition to other regulations as a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with privacy regulations and are bound by similar limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves we also perform services for healthcare companies and are therefore subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information including in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” we also perform creditrelated services and agree to comply with payment card standards including the payment card industry data security standard “pcidss” in addition federal and state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply to our businesses

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” in may 2016 that will replace the current eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr will become fully effective in may 2018 we are analyzing the gdpr to determine its potential effects on our business practices and are awaiting additional anticipated guidance from european union regulators while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2017  we derived approximately 20 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 58 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 5 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2017  

under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer personal information provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare providers we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks 

in certain circumstances third party vendors such as our data center services provider may have access to personal information it is also possible that a third party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal information and we require our third party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to 

our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

changes in laws or regulations to which our clients are subject could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services including our proxy processing and customer communications services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets in addition we perform services for clients in the healthcare insurance and telecommunications industries which are also highly regulated 

changes in laws and regulations may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business also changes in regulations could change the quantity or format of or eliminate the need for certain types of communications further an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

changes in laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

as a provider of technology services to financial institutions certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy disaster recovery information security and third party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo an sec registered brokerdealer and a member of finra bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censures fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors officers or employees our transfer agency business is subject to sec nyse and other federal and state laws and regulations 

our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

 as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data 

protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches   

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

ibm provides us with data center services that include supporting our mainframe midrange open systems network and data center operations as well as disaster recovery services as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from ibm if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

  in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems such as the internet our systems those of our data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 



 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

we rely on the united states postal service “usps” and other third party carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we rely upon the usps and third party carriers including fedex and ups for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients as a result we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control including employee strikes inclement weather and increased fuel costs any failure to deliver communications to our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients in addition the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may as a result implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery if our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications we would be required to use alternative and possibly more expensive carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms if at all which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition future increases in postal rates or shipping costs as well as changes in customer preferences may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 12  “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights if in response to a third party infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such third party’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

we frequently engage in and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 



 we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america “us” these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we have revised our presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to separately present interest expense net previously interest expense net was reported as part of nonoperating expenses net and was not separately presented in the consolidated statements of earnings all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation see note 4 “interest expense net” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for details of the company’s interest expense net note 5 “other nonoperating income expenses net” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for details of the company’s other nonoperating income expenses net and note 19 “quarterly financial results unaudited” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for details of our operating income 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 the company adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201503 “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu no 201503” which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the company has applied this guidance on a retrospective basis and accordingly the consolidated balance sheet under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k as of june 30 2016  has been updated to reflect this new classification which resulted in a decrease in other noncurrent assets of 71 million a decrease in longterm debt excluding current portion of 70 million and a decrease of 01 million in current portion of longterm debt at june 30 2016  

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill   we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 11593 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2017  given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows 

discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 148 million as of june 30 2017 of which 13 million expires in 2018 through 2027 and of which 135 million has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 264 million which expire in 2018 through 2030 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 93 million  and 98 million  at june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments   accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017  stock option grants would result in approximately a 16 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017  stock option grants would result in approximately a 05 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2017  stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017  stock option grants would result in approximately a 07 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  and the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property” and “acquisition and integration costs” represent certain noncash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets and certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities respectively 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2017  mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 19 higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2016  and 2015  mutual fund proxy revenues were 22 higher and 2 lower than the prior fiscal year respectively although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period closed sales does not include eventdriven or distribution activity we consider contract terms expected client volumes or activity knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients among other factors when determining the estimate management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation 

closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance 

 the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2017 we tracked actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract was fully implemented and compared this to the previously reported closed sales amount this process was used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment 

beginning in the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 we have reported closed sales net of a 35 allowance adjustment in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods consequently our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported the allowance adjustment was determined by reviewing the reported closed sales amounts for the prior five fiscal years based on estimated revenues at signing and comparing those amounts to the revenues achieved one year after the clients went live on the services cumulatively during the five years from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016 we reported closed sales of 6893 million based on estimates at signing while revenues achieved one year after golive were 6652 million resulting in revaluation losses of 241 million or a realized loss experience of 35 we will assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years data referenced earlier as the starting point normalized for outlying factors if any to enhance the accuracy of the allowance 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 closed sales which includes contributions from nacc in fiscal year 2017 were 1885 million  1509 million  and 1464 million  respectively the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 is net of an allowance adjustment of 68 million

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary component of “other” are certain gains losses corporate overhead expenses and nonoperating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments such as interest expense foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated operating and nonoperating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income operating income margin net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property acquisition and integration costs and the mal investment gain amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents noncash expenses associated with the companys acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities 

we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property acquisition and integration costs and the mal investment gain from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business 

        free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures unaudited

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2017 2100 million or approximately 19 of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 11021 million is based on floating interest rates our 2100 million in variable rate debt at june 30 2017 consists of our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 100 basis points on borrowed amounts plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 125 basis points on the entire facility we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 15 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 9  of our fiscal year 2017  revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 18  of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2017  resided in our foreign subsidiaries our revenue generating operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus revenue generating operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 87 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2017  would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 463 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering agreements with us and by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials and that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations in addition we take on the responsibility of ensuring that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue because it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of selfregulatory organizations “sros” including the new york stock exchange “nyse” we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers investment companies and financial advisors 

segment revenues represented approximately 77  75 and 74 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively these services include the following 

bankbrokerdealer investor communication solutions  we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our capital markets clients online and in realtime from coordination with third party entities to ordering inventory maintenance mailing tracking and vote tabulation we offer electronic proxy delivery services for the electronic delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on the internet email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting over the internet mobile devices and tablets we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies we also provide a complete reorganization communications solution to notify investors of reorganizations or corporate action events such as tender offers mergers and acquisitions bankruptcies and class action lawsuits

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves we also perform services for healthcare companies in our customer communications business and are therefore subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information including in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 in addition federal and state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply directly to our businesses 

privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals federal and state regulators and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain personal information privacy laws outside the us may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than us laws and regulations and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

risk factors 

tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2016  we derived approximately 25 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 59 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 7 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs for all clients represented approximately 5 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2016  

under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

our investor communication solutions and global technology and operations businesses are generally not directly subject to compliance with laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and will continue to undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec under its regulatory authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy disaster recovery information security and third party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo an sec registered brokerdealer and a member of finra bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censures fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors officers or employees our transfer agency business is subject to sec nyse and other federal and state laws and regulations our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

 as a provider of data and business processing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data including personal information related to our clients customers of our clients and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and information security laws including in the us the grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches   

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in personal information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer personal information provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies mutual funds and healthcare providers we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology entitlement management access control and antimalware software and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks in certain circumstances third party vendors such as our data center services provider may have access to personal information it is also possible that a third party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal information and we require our key third party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors or improperly obtain or disclose the personal information that we or our vendors process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches for example laws may require notification to regulators clients or employees and credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms global banks mutual funds annuity companies institutional investors specialty trading firms independent brokerdealers clearing firms and financial advisors these clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions the current legislative and regulatory environment may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business in addition the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased accordingly failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in fines limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our clients adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services thus causing loss of business from these clients the loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

ibm provides us with data center services that include supporting our mainframe midrange open systems network and data center operations as well as disaster recovery services as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from ibm if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

  in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems such as the internet our systems those of 

our data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in 

addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 11  “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights if in response to a third party infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such third party’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

we frequently engage in and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our 

business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states of america “us” these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts presented may not sum due to rounding 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 we have revised our presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to separately present operating expenses operating income and nonoperating expenses net previously we reported other expenses net as part of total expenses and did not separately present operating income in our consolidated statements of earnings all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation see note 4 “nonoperating expenses net” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for details of the company’s nonoperating expenses net and note 18 “quarterly financial results unaudited” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for details of the company’s operating income 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill   we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment when determining fair value of a reporting unit we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 9993 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2016  given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact 

our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2016  we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 137 million  of which 12 million  expires in 2017 through 2027  and 125 million  which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 314 million  which expire in 2017 through 2030  

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 98 million  and 92 million  at june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments   accounting for stockbased compensation requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016  stock option grants would result in approximately a 15 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016  stock option grants would result in approximately a 04 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2016  stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016  stock option grants would result in approximately a 06 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  and the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“acquisition amortization and other costs” represents amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets as well as certain integration and other transaction costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2016  mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 22 higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2015  and 2014  mutual fund proxy revenues were 2 lower and 31 higher than the prior fiscal year respectively although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix administrative services expenses these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent the expected recurring annual revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge during the periods referenced these types of sales were previously described by the company as recurring revenue closed sales closed sales are a key indicator of broadridges expected future revenue growth the amount of the closed sale is an estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity it excludes distribution revenues the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment 

the company tracks actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the company’s previously reported closed sales amount the company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for differences between the prior years reported closed sales amount and the actual revenues achieved in the first year of the applicable contract closed sales were adjusted by 105 million  29 million  and 10 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations 

the primary components of “other” are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign exchange rates used for internal management reporting 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit

explanation and reconciliation of the company’s use of nongaap financial measures 

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with us gaap except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” these nongaap measures are adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flows these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

the company believes our nongaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans measures and evaluates the company’s business performance management believes that nongaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation in addition and as a consequence of the importance of these nongaap financial measures in managing our business the company’s compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates nongaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation 

adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share 

these nongaap measures reflect operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of acquisition amortization and other costs which represent the amortization of acquired intangibles as well as other transaction costs and certain integration costs associated with the company’s acquisition activities we exclude acquisition amortization and other costs from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings management believes that these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business 

        free cash flows 

in addition to the nongaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flows to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments free cash flows is a nongaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures software purchases and capitalized internal use software 

        set forth below is a reconciliation of such gaap measures to the most directly comparable nongaap measures unaudited

cash flows 

fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015   



the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 63 million was due to a 424 million of increased cash provided by i an increase in net earnings of 204 million combined with ii an increase in noncash expense addbacks and other adjustments of 105 million and iii a decrease in working capital of 115 million notwithstanding the collection of a 261 million tax refund by a canadian subsidiary in the prior year that did not recur offset by b 361 million of increased cash used in noncurrent assets and liabilities due primarily to longterm client contracts 

the decrease  in free cash flows of 32 million  was driven by an increase  in net cash flows provided by operating activities of 63 million  partially offset by increased capital expenditures software purchases and capitalized internal use software of 95 million  

the decrease in cash used in investing activities of 1395 million primarily reflects lower spending of 1499 million  on acquisitions in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year partially offset by higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of 95 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 

the increased cash provided by financing activities of 2669 million reflects a 1819 million  decrease in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of 

1679 million in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year partially offset by a decrease of 373 million  in proceeds from stock options the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year a decrease of 192 million  in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stockbased compensation awards and a 159 million  increase in dividends paid 

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   



the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net earnings and changes in working capital resulting from the timing of accounts receivable collections and vendor payments which includes the collection of a 261 million tax refund by a canadian subsidiary resulting from the prior settlement and execution of the advanced pricing agreement with the internal revenue service and canadian revenue authority 

the increase in free cash flows of 311 million  was driven by an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities of 437 million  partially offset by increased capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of 126 million  

the increase in net cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflects higher spending of 1060 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  as well as higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of 126 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 

the decreased use of net cash flows used in financing activities reflects net proceeds from borrowings on the revolving credit facility of 1650 million in the current year coupled with an increase of 177 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stockbased compensation awards and an increase of 126 million in proceeds from stock options in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year the increased sources were offset by a 1720 million increase in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and a 256 million increase in dividends paid

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks the company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we have access to a revolving credit facility that is based on floating interest rates of which no amount was outstanding as of june 30 2016  our revolving credit facility bears interest at libor plus 100 basis points on borrowed amounts plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 125 basis points on the entire facility we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 22 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  

foreign currency risk

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 76 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and the british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2016  would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 366 million

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as “nominees” because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts on certain types of proposals in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by entering agreements with us and by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy through our agreements with nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of nominees receive proxy materials and that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations in addition we take on the responsibility of ensuring that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation in order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner 

given the large number of nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders we play a unique central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue because it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the nominees through which their shares are held beneficially companies work with us for the performance of all the usual tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported 

securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we bill public companies for the proxy services performed collect the fees and remit to the nominee its portion of the fees in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules the rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile nobo lists we function as an intermediary in the nobo process

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

in fiscal year 2015 we derived approximately 25 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 61 of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs represented approximately 6 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2015 

under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

our investor communication solutions and global technology and operations businesses are generally not directly subject to compliance with laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and will continue to undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

certain aspects of our us operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec under its regulatory authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy disaster recovery information security and vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect financial institutions a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra dol and various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients 

our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo an sec registered brokerdealer and a member of finra bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censures fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors officers or employees our transfer agency business is subject to sec nyse and other federal and state laws and regulations our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of sensitive personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas continues to develop while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms global banks mutual funds annuity companies institutional investors specialty trading firms independent brokerdealers clearing firms and financial advisors these clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions the current legislative and regulatory environment may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business in addition the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased accordingly failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in fines limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our clients adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our 

products and services thus causing loss of business from these clients the loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in sensitive personal information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive personal information provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies and mutual funds we also handle sensitive personal information of our employees in connection with their employment in certain circumstances vendors such as our data center services provider may have access to sensitive personal information we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology denial of service mitigation technology and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cyberattacks and we require our vendors to have adequate security if they have access to personal information however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal information that we process or handle 

many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyberattacks attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents none of which have been successful such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

it is also possible that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal information any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

ibm provides us with data center services that include supporting our mainframe midrange open systems network and data center operations as well as disaster recovery services as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from ibm if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

  in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and 

business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems such as the internet our systems those of our data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 17 

these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 11  “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development licensing and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients through internal development acquisition licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights if in response to a third party infringement allegation we were to determine that we require a license to such third party’s proprietary rights then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us in either of these events we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim even if the claim is baseless and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages grants such party injunctive relief or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

we frequently engage in and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions for example in the last two fiscal years we have acquired six businesses the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 19 

we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations and the mutual fund counterparty is unable to cancel the transaction 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company these financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under both the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill   we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” “asc no 350” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various 

assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 9705 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2015  given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc no 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes   we account for income taxes in accordance with asc no 740 “income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the us federal state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2015  we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 141 million  of which 05 million  expires in 2017 through 2027  and 136 million  which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 374 million  which expire in 2015 through 2030  

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 92 million  and 109 million  at june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments   asc no 718 “compensation—stock compensation” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015  stock option grants would result in approximately a 23 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015  stock option grants would result in approximately a 05 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2015  stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015  stock option grants would result in approximately a 10 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015  grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  and the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings 

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments 

“acquisition amortization and other costs” represents amortization charges associated with intangible asset values as well as other deal costs associated with the company’s acquisitions 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses 

“restructuring charges” refers to severance costs facility exit costs reorganization costs the impact of system development costs for apex clearing holdings llc and the canadian subsidiary of penson worldwide inc and costs to restructure and outsource certain processing related to our desktop applications 

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 27 

of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers in addition mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters 

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenues as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2015  mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 2 lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2014  and 2013  mutual fund proxy revenues were 31 and 54 higher respectively than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials interim communications transaction reporting and fulfillment services as well as matrix financial solutions inc “matrix” administrative services 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postagerelated expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment as well as matrix shareholder services fees these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

closed sales represent anticipated revenues for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge during the periods referenced a sale is considered closed when the company has received the signed client contract for recurring revenue closed sales the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues eventdriven revenue closed sales primarily occur in our investor communication solutions segment the amount of the eventdriven revenue closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues broadridge’s determination of the amount of a closed sale is based on the client’s estimate of transaction volumes and activity levels as our fees are largely based on transaction volume and activity levels the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment the majority of eventdriven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed 

the company tracks actual revenue achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the company’s previously reported closed sales amount the company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for any difference between the prior year’s reported closed sales amount and the actual revenue achieved in the first year of the applicable contract closed sales were adjusted by 31 million  08 million  and 59 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively recurring revenue closed sales were adjusted by 29 million  10 million  and 65 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively eventdriven revenue closed sales were adjusted by 02 million  02 million  and 06 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively

analysis of reportable segments 

broadridge has two reportable operating business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 global technology and operations formerly known as securities processing solutions the primary components of “other” are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit 

in connection with an organizational change made in 2014 in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services certain discrete services that were previously reported in our global technology and operations reportable segment are now reported within the investor communication solutions reportable segment as a result our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments

the company’s results in this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” except where otherwise noted in certain circumstances results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures “nongaap” these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for the company’s reported results 

with regard to statements in this annual report on form 10k that include certain nongaap financial measures the adjusted earnings measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance 

        we also provide information on our free cash flows because we believe this information helps our investors understand the amount of cash available for dividends share repurchases acquisitions and other discretionary investments free cash flows is a nongaap measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles 

  

        the company believes nongaap financial information helps investors understand the effect of these items on our reported results and provides a better representation of our operating performance these nongaap measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between our current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods 

        set forth below is a reconciliation of such nongaap measures unaudited to the most directly comparable gaap measures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risks 

in the ordinary course of business the financial position of the company is routinely subject to certain market risks notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes as a result the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks 

interest rate risk 

as of june 30 2015 1650 million  or approximately 24  of the company’s total outstanding debt balance of 6894 million  is based on floating interest rates our 1650 million  in variable rate debt at june 30 2015  consists of our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 1125 basis points we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 our pretax earnings would have decreased by approximately 05 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 

foreign currency risk 

while the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the us approximately 12  of our fiscal year 2015 revenues were earned outside of the us and approximately 18  of our total consolidated assets as of june 30 2015  resided in our foreign subsidiaries our operations outside of the us primarily reside in canada and the united kingdom as a result we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our nonus operations primarily with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 

we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring to the extent practicable operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate we do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and british pound versus the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pretax earnings of approximately 72 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and the british pound versus the us dollar at june 30 2015 would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately 323 million

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts on certain types of proposals in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the securities and exchange commission’s the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

  

in fiscal year 2014 the sec approved the proxy distribution fee changes proposed by the nyse in may 2012 the fee changes went into effect for shareholder meetings with record dates on or after january 1 2014 and we have implemented the approved changes 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers investment companies and financial advisors

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

in fiscal year 2014 we derived approximately 25 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 60 of the revenues of our securities processing solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 5 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology such costs represented approximately 6 of the company’s total assets as of june 30 2014 under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted in addition the recent economic slowdown and its specific impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business 

  

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to compliance with laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject therefore our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

certain of our securities processing operations are periodically reviewed by the ffiec under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data integrity disaster recovery and information security a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services 

in addition our business process outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra and various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 

there has been increased public attention regarding the use of sensitive personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas continues to develop while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure in addition legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms global banks mutual funds annuity companies institutional investors specialty trading firms independent brokerdealers clearing firms and financial advisors these clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions the current legislative and regulatory environment may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business in addition the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased accordingly 

  

failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in fines limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our clients adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or their demand for our products and services thus causing loss of business from these clients the loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in sensitive personal information being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer sensitive personal information provided to us by our clients which include financial institutions public companies and mutual funds we also handle sensitive personal information of our employees in connection with their employment in certain circumstances vendors such as our data center services provider may have access to sensitive personal information we maintain systems and procedures including encryption authentication technology data loss prevention technology and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information including by cybersecurity attacks and we require our vendors to have adequate security if they have access to personal information however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal information that we process or handle in addition certain of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks it is also possible that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal information any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation remediation legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches furthermore a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

ibm provides us with data center services that include supporting our mainframe midrange open systems network and data center operations as well as disaster recovery services as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from ibm if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ requirements our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

  

in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems such as the internet our systems those of our data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation in addition we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volumes market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

  

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 13 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients either through internal development acquisition or licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally 

  

third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we engage in and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal economic political and other conditions 

a portion of our revenue is generated outside the us and in recent years we have expanded our operations entered strategic alliances and acquired businesses outside the us also our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries particularly in those with developing economies and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation and currency 

  

fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies in addition our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or manmade disasters wars terrorist activities or any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue 

our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients or other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations and the mutual fund counterparty is unable to cancel the transaction 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates by their nature are based on judgment available information and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable however actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” “asc no 350” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 8561 million of goodwill as of june 30 2014 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc no 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with asc no 740 “income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to the continuous 

  

examination of our income tax returns by the irs state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2014 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 188 million of which 19 million expires in 2017 through 2027 and 169 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 455 million which expire in 2015 through 2030 

valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings the company has recorded valuation allowances of 109 million and 125 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss projected future taxable income carryforward periods scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 

sharebased payments  asc no 718 “compensation—stock compensation” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2014 stock option grants would result in approximately a 22 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2014 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2014 stock option grants would result in approximately a 06 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2014 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2014 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2014 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2014 stock option grants would result in approximately a 11 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2014 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings from continuing operations and analysis of reportable segments 

“acquisition amortization and other costs” represents amortization charges associated with intangible asset values as well as other deal costs associated with the company’s acquisitions 

“net new business” refers to recurring revenue closed sales less revenue from recurring revenue client losses 

“restructuring charges” refers to severance costs facility exit costs reorganization costs the impact of system development costs for apex clearing holdings llc “apex holdings” and the canadian subsidiary of penson worldwide inc and costs to restructure and outsource certain processing related to our desktop applications 

“restructuring and impairment charges net” referred to herein represent the restructuring charges defined above and the following charges 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 

  

  

   

eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenue as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings is difficult to forecast 

distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment these costs are reflected in cost of revenues 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 31 and 54 higher respectively than the prior fiscal years while during fiscal year 2012 mutual fund proxy revenues were 28 lower than the prior fiscal year although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future 

closed sales represent anticipated revenues for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge during the periods referenced a sale is considered closed when the company has received the signed client contract for recurring revenue closed sales the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues eventdriven revenue closed sales primarily occur in our investor communication solutions segment the amount of the eventdriven revenue closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues broadridge’s determination of the amount of a closed sale is based on the client’s estimate of transaction volumes and activity levels as our fees are largely based on transaction volume and activity levels the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our securities processing solutions segment the majority of eventdriven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed 

the company tracks actual revenue achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the company’s previously reported closed sales amount the company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for any difference between the prior year’s reported closed sales amount and the actual revenue achieved in the first year of the applicable contract closed sales were adjusted by 08 million 59 million and 31 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively recurring revenue closed sales were adjusted by 10 million 65 million and 31 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively eventdriven revenue closed sales were adjusted by 02 million and 06 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively eventdriven revenue closed sales were not adjusted for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012

we are the former brokerage services division of automatic data processing inc “adp” broadridge financial solutions inc was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of adp on march 29 2007 in anticipation of our spinoff from adp five years ago we spun off from adp and began operating as an independent public company on march 30 2007 our company has 50 years of history of providing innovative solutions to financial services firms and publiclyheld companies in 1962 the brokerage services division of adp opened for business with one client processing an average of 300 trades per night in 1979 we expanded our usbased securities processing solutions to process canadian securities 

we made significant additions to our securities processing solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid1990s in 1995 we acquired a londonbased provider of multicurrency clearance and settlement services to become a global supplier of transaction processing services in 1996 we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems 

we began offering our proxy services in 1989 the proxy services business which started what has become our investor communication solutions business leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our securities processing solutions business our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations in 1992 we acquired the independent election corporation of america which further increased our proxy services capabilities by 1999 we were handling over 90 of the investor communication distributions for all securities held of record by banks and brokerdealers in the us—from proxy statements to annual reports during the 1990s we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of canadian and united kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies 

in 1998 having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services in 2001 we developed and released postedge ® to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications 

in 2004 we purchased bank of america corporation’s us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses which enabled us to provide securities clearing and operations outsourcing services through our subsidiary ridge clearing  outsourcing solutions inc “ridge” in 2010 ridge sold the contracts of substantially all of its securities clearing clients and no longer performs securities clearing services for correspondent brokerdealers our operations outsourcing services are now part of our securities processing solutions business 

the broadridge business 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” 

  

meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the securities and exchange commission’s the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services in addition the nyse rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as broadridge 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers and investment companies

securities processing solutions 

transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution at that point the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse the records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction tax custody accounting and recordkeeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction the accurate processing of trading activity and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction

regulation 

the securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets 

in the us the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws at the federal level the sec regulates the securities industry along with the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the various stock exchanges and other sros our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec finra and sro regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue for public comment a concept release the “concept release” focusing on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec sought public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest the comment period on the concept release ended in 2010 the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release there are no indicators that would enable the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business however as with any regulatory change we may have to incur additional costs to adapt our business to possible modifications in the proxy system that could result from the rulemaking process initiated by the concept release in september 2010 the nyse formed the proxy fee advisory committee made up of issuers brokerdealers and investors to review the nyse proxy distribution fees in may 2012 the proxy fee advisory committee issued its recommendations on the fees paid by issuers for the distribution of proxy materials to beneficial shareholders the report makes recommendations for changes in fees however at this time it is not a formal proposal for changing the nyse rules pertaining to fees any such changes would be subject to public comment and sec approval we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec the sros or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the concept release and the proxy fee advisory committee recommendations if changes are made to the us proxy system we expect to continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or 

  

potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services in addition we engage independent auditors to review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their regulators 

our operations outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by registered brokerdealers as registered brokerdealers and members of finra they are subject to regulations concerning many aspects of their business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention the protection of customer funds and customer securities and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of their businesses or disqualification of their directors officers or employees in addition as registered brokerdealers they are required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” for the benefit of customers in addition mg trust company llc “mg trust” a subsidiary of matrix is a colorado state nondepository trust company whose primary business is to provide cash agent custodial and directed or nondiscretionary trust services to institutional customers mg trust operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the colorado division of banking 

in addition our operations outsourcing services are subject to regulatory oversight by the sec and finra the recent economic turmoil has resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing of regulatory functions this oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to operations outsourcing we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec and finra and if new requirements are enacted we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices in addition if we expand our outsourcing solutions services into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business 

our transfer agency business broadridge corporate issuer solutions inc is subject to certain rules and regulations promulgated by the sec including without limitation with respect to registration with the sec annual reporting examination internal controls proper disposal of shareholder information and obligations relating to its operations our transfer agency business has been formally approved by the nyse to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of nyse listed securities and is subject to certain nyse requirements concerning operational standards furthermore it is also subject to us internal revenue service the “irs” and postal regulations as well as certain provisions of the grammleachbliley act and the federal trade commission’s regulations with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards 

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions applies to certain aspects of our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses and to the services that involve data processing for financial institutions and applies indirectly to our other businesses through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards in addition state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply directly to our businesses these laws may require notification to affected individuals state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information these regulations and laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures 

  

similar data privacy laws related to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information exist outside of the us such as the european union’s 9546 ec directive of the european parliament canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act individual european national laws and data privacy laws of other countries in some cases these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the grammleachbliley act the us state privacy laws or consumer protection laws and may impose additional duties on companies 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

other 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the us and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry in recent years the economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2012 we derived approximately 23 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 63 of the revenues of our securities processing solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 5 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted in addition the current economic slowdown and its specific impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also 

  

changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue the concept release for public comment the concept release focuses on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec sought public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest the comment period on the concept release ended in 2010 the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release there are no indicators that would enable the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business however as with any regulatory change we may have to incur additional costs to adapt our business to possible modifications in the proxy system that could result from the rulemaking process initiated by the concept release in september 2010 the nyse formed the proxy fee advisory committee made up of issuers brokerdealers and investors to review the nyse proxy distribution fees in may 2012 the proxy fee advisory committee issued its recommendations on the fees paid by issuers for the distribution of proxy materials to beneficial shareholders the report makes recommendations for changes in fees however at this time it is not a formal proposal for changing the nyse rules pertaining to fees any such changes would be subject to public comment and sec approval we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec the sros or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the concept release and the proxy fee advisory committee recommendations 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the ffiec we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec has been conducting periodic reviews of certain of our operations since august 2006 in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra and various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to our regulated subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of those businesses furthermore regulatory approval may be required before expansion of these business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 

  

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms global banks mutual funds annuity companies institutional investors specialty trading firms independent brokerdealers and clearing firms these clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions the current legislative and regulatory environment may impact the way that our clients do business in a way that could adversely impact us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business in addition the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities including the sec finra securities exchanges state attorneys general and international regulators have increased accordingly failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in fines limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our clients adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or demand for our products and services thus causing loss of business from these clients the loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the number of unique securities positions levels of eventdriven communications activity trading volume market prices or the liquidity of the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy and mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of eventdriven communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volume market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions and investors in public companies and mutual funds our clients that are financial institutions or clients that collect or handle personal information outside the us are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed misused altered destroyed or otherwise compromised and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions applies to certain aspects of our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses and to the services that involve data processing for financial institutions and applies indirectly to our other businesses through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards in addition state privacy and information security laws and consumer protection laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply directly to our businesses we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards which vary based on service and information type including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet however despite those safeguards it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers or investors in public companies and mutual funds any breach of our information security policies or safeguards resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of personal or account information could result in interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those breaches our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches furthermore such breaches could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or cause damage to our reputation 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

ibm provides us with data center services under the it services agreement that include supporting our mainframe midrange open systems network and data center operations as well as disaster recovery services as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from ibm if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in 

  

the it services agreement however we may not adequately be protected against all possible losses through the terms of the it services agreement 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

  

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 13 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

  

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business these systems and applications are primarily developed by employees or independent contractors or obtained through acquisitions our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients either through internal development acquisition or licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we engage in and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our outsourced data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our primary outsourced data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world that may be targets of terrorism terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenues and profitability for that period of time if terrorist incidents cause interruption of the financial services industry or securities market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our customers other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations and the mutual fund counterparty is not able to cancel the transaction 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

please refer to note 13 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these consolidated financial statements present the consolidated position of the company these consolidated financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” “asc no 350” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 7800 million of goodwill as of june 30 2012 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc no 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with asc no 740 “income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of 

  

accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof the company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs state and foreign tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2012 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 217 million of which 06 million expires in 2017 through 2027 and 211 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 636 million which expire in 2018 through 2032 we have recorded valuation allowances of 147 million and 121 million at june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively because the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

sharebased payments  asc no 718 “compensation—stock compensation” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2012 stock option grants would result in approximately a 11 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2012 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2012 stock option grants would result in approximately a 02 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2012 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2012 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2012 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2012 stock option grants would result in approximately a 04 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2012 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

the following definitions describe the company’s revenues 

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it may not recur on an annual basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 

  

  

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process eventdriven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven fee revenue as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings is difficult to forecast 

fiscal year 2010 presale fulfillment revenues have been reclassified from eventdriven revenues to recurring revenues to conform to the current period’s presentation 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2010 the company processed a record level of mutual fund proxy activity in contrast during fiscal years 2011 and 2012 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 74 and 28 lower respectively than their prior fiscal years although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future however the level of volatility experienced between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 was greater than we have experienced in prior years 

revenues derived from sales are a component of “net new business” which is defined herein as our closed sales less client losses closed sales represent anticipated revenues for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge during the periods referenced a sale is considered closed when the company has received the signed 

  

client contract for recurring revenue closed sales the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues eventdriven revenue closed sales primarily occur in our investor communication solutions segment the amount of the eventdriven revenue closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues broadridge’s determination of the amount of a closed sale is based on the client’s estimate of transaction volumes and activity levels as our fees are largely based on transaction volume and activity levels the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by our securities processing solutions segment the majority of eventdriven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed 

the company tracks actual revenue achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the company’s previously reported closed sales amount the company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for any difference between the prior year’s reported closed sales amount and the actual revenue achieved in the first year of the applicable contract closed sales were adjusted by 31 million 09 million and 24 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively recurring revenue closed sales were adjusted by 31 million 09 million and 11 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively

cash flows 

net cash flows provided by operating activities were 2906 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 compared to 1909 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 the increase is primarily due to a decrease in working capital driven by reductions in accounts receivable due to improved collections and lower payables and accruals consistent with the seasonality of our business which were partially offset by higher deferred costs driven by our client conversions activity and the ibm migration costs 

net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 were 1105 million a decrease of 2303 million compared to 3408 million of net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 the decrease reflects lower spending of 2211 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011

income taxes 

before the spinoff from our former parent company automatic data processing inc “adp” the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the spinoff the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company 

the company headquartered in the us is routinely examined by the irs as part of the irs us federal income tax audit of adp and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the us states and foreign countries in which it conducts business the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction with respect to us federal income taxes the company was a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group through march 30 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidation the company is included in any irs examination of adp for periods up to and including march 30 2007 adp and the company are currently under irs audit for the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 which was substantially completed in fiscal year 2009 in addition the irs is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and adp the us federal income tax payable of the company for the period ended march 30 2007 will be assumed by adp in addition any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the irs attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier will be tax liabilities assumed by adp correspondingly any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax 

  

liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2012 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period

history and development of our company 

we are the former brokerage services division of automatic data processing inc “adp” broadridge financial solutions inc was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of adp on march 29 2007 in anticipation of our spinoff from adp on march 30 2007 we spun off from adp and began operating as an independent public company our company has more than 40 years of history of providing innovative solutions to financial services firms and publiclyheld companies in 1962 the brokerage services division of adp opened for business with one client processing an average of 300 trades per night in 1979 we expanded our usbased securities processing solutions to process canadian securities 

we made significant additions to our securities processing solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid1990s in 1995 we acquired a londonbased provider of multicurrency clearance and settlement services to become a global supplier of transaction processing services in 1996 we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems 

we began offering our proxy services in 1989 the proxy services business which started what has become our investor communication solutions business leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our securities processing solutions business our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations in 1992 we acquired the independent election corporation of america which further increased our proxy services capabilities by 1999 we were handling over 90 of the investor communication distributions for all securities held of record by banks and brokerdealers in the us—from proxy statements to annual reports during the 1990s we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of canadian and united kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies 

in 1998 having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services in 2001 we developed and released postedge ® to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications 

in 2004 we purchased bank of america corporation’s us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses which enabled us to provide securities clearing and operations outsourcing services through our subsidiary ridge clearing  outsourcing solutions inc “ridge” in 2010 ridge sold the contracts of 

  

substantially all of its securities clearing clients and no longer performs securities clearing services for correspondent brokerdealers our operations outsourcing services performed by ridge are now part of our securities processing solutions business 

the broadridge business 

our operations are classified into two business segments 1 investor communication solutions and 2 securities processing solutions 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the securities and exchange commission’s the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers and investment companies 

  

the services we provide in this segment represented approximately 72 76 and 74 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments described in note 1 “basis of presentation” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k these services include the following

corporate issuer offerings  we are the largest processor and provider of investor communication solutions to public companies we offer our corporate issuer clients many tools to facilitate their communications with investors such as internet and telephone proxy voting electronic delivery of corporate filings and householding of communications to stockholders at the same address one of our opportunities for growth in the investor communication solutions segment involves serving corporate issuer clients in providing communications services to registered stockholders—that is stockholders who do not hold their shares through a brokerdealer in street name we also offer proxy services to nonnorth american corporate issuers in connection with their general and special meetings of stockholders our corporate issuer services include sharelink ®  which provides complete project management for the beneficial and registered proxy process

securities processing solutions 

transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution at that point the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse the records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction tax custody accounting and recordkeeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction the accurate processing of trading activity and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction 

our securities processing solutions automate the transaction lifecycle of equity mutual fund fixed income and option securities trading operations from order capture and execution through trade confirmation settlement custody and accounting our services facilitate the automation of straightthroughprocessing operations and enable financial institutions efficiently and costeffectively to consolidate their books and records focus on their core businesses and manage risk with our multicurrency capabilities we support trading activities on a global basis

on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue for public comment a concept release the “concept release” focusing on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec is seeking public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest the comment period on the concept release ended in 2010 the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release it is too early in the process for the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business however as with any regulatory change we may have to incur additional costs to adapt our business to possible modifications in the proxy system that could result from the rulemaking process initiated by the concept release in september 2010 the nyse formed the proxy fee advisory committee made up of issuers brokerdealers and investors to review the nyse proxy distribution fees the committee has not taken any action but their recommendations could result in the nyse submitting a rule change proposal to the sec we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec the sros or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the concept release if changes are made to the us proxy system we expect to continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices 

  

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services in addition we engage independent auditors to review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their regulators 

in june 2010 we completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all of ridge’s securities clearing clients and ridge no longer performs securities clearing services for correspondent brokerdealers however ridge remains a registered brokerdealer to perform operations outsourcing services in january 2011 we acquired matrix a provider of mutual fund processing services for third party administrators financial advisors banks and wealth management professionals as registered brokerdealers and members of finra ridge and matrix are subject to regulations concerning many aspects of their business including trade practices capital requirements record retention money laundering prevention and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees for ridge these regulations include the sec’s customer protection rule which protects both the customer funds and customer securities the sec’s hypothecation rules 8c1 and 15c21 regarding the borrowing and lending of customer securities regulation t which regulates the borrowing and lending of securities by brokerdealers and regulation sho which prohibits short sales in certain instances matrix does not hold customer funds or securities so it is not therefore subject to the full requirements of the sec’s customer protection rule a failure by ridge or matrix to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of their business or disqualification of their directors officers or employees in addition as registered brokerdealers ridge and matrix are required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” for the benefit of customers matrix’s subsidiary mg trust company llc “mg trust” is a colorado state nondepository trust company whose primary business is to provide cash agent custodial and directed or nondiscretionary trust services to institutional customers mg trust operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the colorado division of banking 

in addition our operations outsourcing services are subject to regulatory oversight by the sec and finra the recent economic turmoil has resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing of regulatory functions this oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to operations outsourcing we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec and finra and if new requirements are enacted we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices in addition if we expand our outsourcing solutions services into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business 

our transfer agency business broadridge corporate issuer solutions is subject to certain rules and regulations promulgated by the sec including without limitation with respect to registration with the sec annual reporting examination internal controls proper disposal of consumer report information and obligations relating to its operations our transfer agency business has been formally approved by the nyse to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of nyse listed securities and is subject to certain nyse requirements concerning operational standards furthermore it is also subject to us internal revenue service the “irs” and postal regulations as well as certain provisions of the grammleachbliley act and the federal trade commission’s regulations with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards 

  

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions applies to certain aspects of our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses and indirectly to our other businesses through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards state privacy and information security laws which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information also apply directly to our businesses privacy laws may require notification to affected individuals state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information these regulations and laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures 

similar data privacy laws related to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information exist outside of the us such as the european union’s 9546 ec directive of the european parliament canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act individual european national laws and data privacy laws of other countries in some cases these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the grammleachbliley act or the us state privacy laws and may impose additional duties on companies 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

other 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the us and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry in recent years the economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2011 we derived approximately 24 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 70 of the revenues of our securities processing solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 5 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation financial difficulties or bankruptcy or the termination or nonrenewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations also in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business in addition to losing the revenue from that client the company would be required to writeoff any investments made by the company in connection with that client under a number of our contracts our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted in addition the current economic slowdown and its specific impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business 

  

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue the concept release for public comment the concept release focuses on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec is seeking public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest the comment period on the concept release ended in 2010 the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release it is too early in the process for the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business however as with any regulatory change we may have to incur additional costs to adapt our business to possible modifications in the proxy system that could result from the rulemaking process initiated by the concept release in september 2010 the nyse formed the proxy fee advisory committee made up of issuers brokerdealers and investors to review the nyse proxy distribution fees the committee has not taken any action but their recommendations could result in the nyse submitting a fee change proposal to the sec for their consideration 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the ffiec council we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec has been conducting periodic reviews of certain of our operations since august 2006 in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra and various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services we could lose our clients be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to our regulated subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on the financial 

  

performance of those businesses furthermore regulatory approval may be required before expansion of these business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

we provide technology solutions to a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms global banks mutual funds annuity companies institutional investors specialty trading firms independent brokerdealers and clearing firms these clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions the current legislative and regulatory environment may impact the way that our clients do business in a way that could adversely impact us for example new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services seek to renegotiate existing agreements or cease or curtail their operations all of which could adversely impact our business in addition the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities including the sec finra securities exchanges state attorneys general and international regulators have increased accordingly failure to comply with laws regulations or policies including regulatory capital requirements could result in fines limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our clients adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase or demand for our products and services thus causing loss of business from these clients the loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the number of unique securities positions levels of eventdriven communications activity trading volume market prices or the liquidity of the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy and eventdriven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy and mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

  

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients the level of eventdriven communications activity we process on behalf of our clients trading volume market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions and investors in public companies and mutual funds our clients that are financial institutions or that collect or handle personal information outside the us are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed misused altered destroyed or otherwise compromised and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them our operations outsourcing mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses are regulated entities and are therefore directly subject to these laws and regulations in addition state privacy and information security laws that apply to data processors apply to all of our processing services we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards which vary based on service and information type including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet however despite those safeguards it is possible that hackers employees acting contrary to security policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers or investors in public companies and mutual funds any breach of our information security policies or safeguards resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of personal or account information could result in interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those breaches our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches furthermore such breaches could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

adp provides us with data center services under a data center outsourcing services agreement that include hosting the mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp in march 2010 we entered into the it services agreement with ibm under which ibm will provide us with data center services we expect the migration to ibm to be completed by june 2012 and adp will continue to provide us with data center services until the migration to ibm is complete during the transition to ibm if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed in addition there is a risk that we may experience a disruption as a result of the transition from adp to ibm impacting the services we provide to our clients as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in our services agreements with adp and ibm however we may not adequately be protected against all possible losses through the terms of those agreements 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients andor certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

  

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business with the exception of one recentlyhired executive officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business these systems and applications are primarily developed by employees or independent contractors or obtained through acquisitions our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients either through internal development acquisition or licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we have been and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

   

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our outsourced data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our outsourced data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world that may be targets of terrorism terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenues and profitability for that period of time if terrorist incidents cause interruption of the financial services industry or securities market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

  

our mutual fund processing services performed by matrix may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our mutual fund processing services performed by matrix involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our customers other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations and the mutual fund counterparty is not able to cancel the transaction 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

please refer to note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

basis of presentation 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these consolidated financial statements present the consolidated position of the company these consolidated financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 

in presenting the consolidated financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion 

  

the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” “asc no 350” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 7356 million of goodwill as of june 30 2011 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings 

in january 2011 the company acquired matrix which was tested separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment test at march 31 2011 matrix was excluded from the sensitivity analysis discussed below as it was acquired in january 2011 accordingly the carrying value of the net assets acquired approximated fair value at march 31 2011 

the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc no 350 assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with asc no 740 “income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition although currently not under any us or foreign income tax exam for the period march 31 2007 through june 30 2011 in the future we expect to be subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2011 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 227 million of which 03 million expires in 2012 through 2018 and 224 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 635 million which expire in 2020 through 2029 we have recorded valuation allowances of 

  

121 million and 159 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively because the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

sharebased payments  asc no 718 “compensation—stock compensation” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

ibm it services agreement 

in march 2010 the company and ibm entered into the it services agreement under which ibm will provide certain aspects of the company’s information technology infrastructure that are currently provided under a data center outsourcing services agreement with adp under the it services agreement ibm will provide a broad range of technology services to the company including supporting its mainframe midrange server network and data center operations as well as providing disaster recovery services the company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time the company expects that the migration of its data center processing from adp to ibm will be completed by june 2012 the it services agreement expires on june 30 2022 the company has the right to renew the initial term of the it services agreement for up to one additional 12month term 

the company expects to complete the migration of its data center processing from adp to ibm by june 2012 adp will continue to provide data processing services to the company until the migration is complete the company is anticipating that it will realize approximately 250 million in average annual cost savings net of deferred cost amortization over the term of the it services agreement beginning in the fiscal year ending june 30 2013 

the company is in the early stages of this migration during the course of the migration to ibm the company will incur migration costs as part of establishing an operable ibm data center for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 the company recorded expenses of 63 million in the consolidated statements of earnings related to this agreement the company currently estimates that it will incur total migration costs of approximately 950 million related to this agreement until the migration is complete we anticipate expensing 

  

approximately 400 million of these costs and we plan to capitalize the remaining 550 million of migration costs 

results of operations 

the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statement of earnings from continuing operations and analysis of reportable segments refers to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 and the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings from continuing operations should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings from continuing operations prior fiscal year presale fulfillment revenues have been reclassified from eventdriven revenues to recurring revenues to conform to the current fiscal year’s presentation 

analysis of consolidated statement of earnings from continuing operations 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

the table below presents consolidated statement of earnings from continuing operations data for the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 and the dollar and percentage changes between periods 

 

 revenues  revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 21669 million a decrease of 423 million or 2 compared to 22092 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the 2 decrease was driven by lower eventdriven fee revenues of 1214 million mainly the result of a decrease in mutual fund proxy activity when compared to the record level of activity during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 also contributing to the 2 decline were lower distribution revenues driven by the lower eventdriven mutual fund proxy activity of 765 million or 10 down from 7806 million to 7041 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 respectively these declines were partially offset by a positive contribution from recurring fee revenues of 1432 million reflecting gains from acquisitions and the penson outsourcing agreement revenue from closed sales less client losses referred to as “net new business” herein internal growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 124 million revenues from acquisitions and the penson outsourcing agreement contributed 1225 million 

  

fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and eventdriven activity in addition the level of recurring and eventdriven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues while eventdriven activity is highly repeatable it does not recur on a regular basis the types of services we provide that comprise eventdriven activity are 

 

  

  

 eventdriven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process these events are impacted by financial market conditions and regulatory compliance requirements resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of eventdriven activity as such the timing and level of eventdriven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings is difficult to forecast 

generally mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of eventdriven activity during fiscal year 2010 the company processed a record level of mutual fund proxy activity in contrast during fiscal year 2011 mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 74 lower than in fiscal year 2010 although it is difficult to forecast the levels of eventdriven activity we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future however the level of volatility experienced between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 was greater than we have experienced in prior years 

included in the preceding and following revenues discussions are revenues derived from sales a component of net new business a sale is considered closed when the company has received the signed client contract for any services that do not require a contract the sale is considered closed when the services are in production for recurring revenue closed sales the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues to be generated by the closed sale based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues eventdriven revenue closed sales occur in the investor communication solutions segment the amount of the eventdriven revenue closed sales is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues to be generated by the closed sales based on client volumes or activity excluding passthrough revenues such as distribution revenues larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues particularly for the services provided by the securities processing solutions segment the majority of eventdriven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed 

closed sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 1337 million a decrease of 413 million or 24 compared to 1750 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 1134 million a decrease of 53 million or 4 compared to 1187 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 excluding the three large recurring revenue sales that are described below recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 800 million an increase of 19 million or 2 compared to 781 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 during the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 the investor communication solutions segment closed a fulfillment services recurring revenue sale with fidelity investments for 112 million and a transaction reporting services recurring revenue sale with morgan stanley smith barney llc “mssb” for 406 million respectively during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 the securities processing solutions segment closed a recurring 

  

revenue sale with a large global institutional bank for equity and fixed income securities processing services of 222 million eventdriven revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 203 million a decrease of 360 million or 64 compared to 563 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 primarily due to lower registered mutual fund proxy and solicitation services 

total expenses  total expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 18972 million an increase of 301 million or 2 compared to 18671 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the increase reflects higher cost of revenues of 07 million higher selling general and administrative expenses of 284 million or 12 and higher other expenses net of 10 million or 11 the increase in total expenses relate mainly to acquisitions and the penson outsourcing agreement of 1366 million and ibm migration costs of 63 million mostly offset by 1128 million of lower expenses mainly from lower eventdriven activity including the decline in cost of distribution revenues as discussed above 

cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 16171 million an increase of 07 million compared to 16164 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the increase reflects costs of 1059 million related to acquisitions and the penson outsourcing agreement ibm migration costs of 63 million and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 55 million virtually offset by lower distribution costs related to lower distribution revenues of 1007 excluding acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other variable costs of 170 million distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 6135 million a decrease of 722 million or 11 compared to 6857 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 distribution cost of revenues consist primarily of postage related expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 2700 million an increase of 284 million or 12 compared to 2416 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the 12 increase is primarily due to increased costs of 307 million related to acquisitions and the penson outsourcing agreement

the primary components of “other” are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated expense items of an unusual or nonrecurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit

cash flows 

net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1909 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 a decrease of 1692 million compared to 3601 million net cash flows provided during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the decrease is primarily due to a decline in net earnings of continuing operations of 533 million and an increase in working capital of 1005 million the increase in working capital is primarily driven 

  

by an increase in accounts receivable of 676 million due to the timing of revenue and timing of collections and a decrease in accrued broker fees of 157 million due to the timing of revenue 

net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were 3408 million an increase of 2525 million compared to 883 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the increase primarily reflects higher spending of 2583 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 and higher purchases of intangible assets of 77 million slightly offset by a decline in capital expenditures of 135 million

income taxes 

before the spinoff from our former parent company adp the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the spinoff the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company 

the company headquartered in the us is routinely examined by the irs as part of the irs us federal income tax audit of adp and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the us states and foreign countries in which it conducts business the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction with respect to us federal income taxes the company was a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group through march 30 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidation the company is included in any irs examination of adp for periods up to and including march 30 2007 adp and the company are currently under irs audit for the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 which was substantially completed in fiscal year 2009 in addition the irs is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and adp the us federal income tax payable of the company for the period ended march 30 2007 will be assumed by adp in addition any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the irs attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier will be tax liabilities assumed by adp correspondingly any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2011 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable 

  

to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period

history and development of our company 

we are the former brokerage services division of automatic data processing inc “adp” broadridge financial solutions inc was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of adp on march 29 2007 in anticipation of our spinoff from adp on march 30 2007 we spun off from adp and began operating as an independent public company our company has more than 40 years of history of providing innovative solutions to financial services firms and publiclyheld companies in 1962 the brokerage services division of adp opened for business with one client processing an average of 300 trades per night in 1979 we expanded our usbased securities processing solutions to process canadian securities 

  

we made significant additions to our securities processing solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid1990s in 1995 we acquired a londonbased provider of multicurrency clearance and settlement services to become a global supplier of transaction processing services in 1996 we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems 

we began offering our proxy services in 1989 the proxy services business which started what has become our investor communication solutions business leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our securities processing solutions business our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations in 1992 we acquired the independent election corporation of america which further increased our proxy services capabilities by 1999 we were handling over 90 of the investor communication distributions for all securities held of record by banks and brokerdealers in the us—from proxy statements to annual reports during the 1990s we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of canadian and united kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies 

in 1998 having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services in 2001 we developed and released postedge ® to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications 

in 2004 we purchased bank of america corporation’s us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses which enabled us to provide securities clearing and operations outsourcing services in 2010 we sold the contracts of substantially all of our securities clearing clients and commenced the wind down of the securities clearing business we will continue to perform our operations outsourcing services as part of our securities processing solutions business 

the broadridge business 

our operations are classified into two business segments investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

  

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the securities and exchange commission’s the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers and investment companies 

the services we provide in this segment represented approximately 76 74 and 74 of our total revenues in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments described in note 1 “basis of presentation” to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k these services include the following

institutional investor offerings  we provide a suite of services to manage the entire proxy voting process of institutional investors including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs such as 

  

proxyedge our workflow solution that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy voting can be instructed for the entire position by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers proxyedge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting proxyedge can be utilized for meetings of us and canadian companies and for meetings in many nonnorth american countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients 

corporate issuer offerings  we are the largest processor and provider of investor communication solutions to public companies we offer our corporate issuer clients many tools to facilitate their communications with investors such as internet and telephone proxy voting electronic delivery of corporate filings and householding of communications to stockholders at the same address one of our opportunities for growth in the investor communication solutions segment involves serving corporate issuer clients in providing communications services to registered stockholders—that is stockholders who do not hold their shares through a brokerdealer in street name we also offer proxy services to nonnorth american corporate issuers in connection with their general and special meetings of stockholders our corporate issuer services include sharelink ®  which provides complete project management for the beneficial and registered proxy process 

our shareholder forum and virtual shareholder meeting solutions were introduced last year the shareholder forum is an online venue that offers public companies the ability to host structured controlled communication with their shareholders on a timely and regular basis validated shareholders can submit questions answer surveys in preparation of the annual meeting and yearround and communicate in various ways with a corporation our virtual shareholder meeting service provides corporate issuers with the ability to host their annual meeting electronically on the internet either on a standalone basis or in conjunction with their physical annual meeting as the entity that provides beneficial shareholder proxy processing on behalf of many banks and brokerage firms we can provide shareholder validation and voting to companies that want to hold virtual meetings in fiscal year 2010 we enabled 20 companies to hold virtual shareholder meetings 

in fiscal year 2010 we entered the transfer agency business through our acquisition of stocktrans a leading provider of registrar stock transfer and recordkeeping services with over 38 years of experience our transfer agency strategy is to address the needs public companies have expressed for lowercost more reliable stockholder record maintenance and communication services by leveraging our existing investor communications and securities processing capabilities to enable us to deliver enhanced transfer agency services to corporate issuers

securities processing solutions 

transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution at that point the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse the records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction tax custody 

  

accounting and recordkeeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction the accurate processing of trading activity and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction 

our securities processing solutions automate the transaction lifecycle of equity mutual fund fixed income and option securities trading operations from order capture and execution through trade confirmation settlement custody and accounting our services facilitate the automation of straightthroughprocessing operations and enable financial institutions efficiently and costeffectively to consolidate their books and records focus on their core businesses and manage risk with our multicurrency capabilities we support trading activities on a global basis

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our investor communication solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions including transfer agents who handle communication services to registered nonbeneficial securities holders proxy advisory firms proxy solicitation firms and other proxy services providers we also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling and printing of transaction confirmations and account statements our securities processing solutions business principally competes with brokerage firms that perform their trade processing inhouse and with numerous other outsourcing vendors our backoffice support services offered through this segment also compete with very large financial institutions that manage their own backoffice recordkeeping operations in many cases clients engage us only to perform certain functions such as backoffice processing and do not outsource their other functions such as clearing operations support that we would also perform for them 

technology 

we have several information processing systems which serve as the core foundation of our technology platform we leverage these systems in order to provide our services we are committed to maintaining extremely high levels of quality service through our skilled technical employees and the use of our technology within an environment that seeks continual improvement 

our missioncritical applications are designed to provide high levels of availability scalability reliability and flexibility they operate on industry standard enterprise architecture platforms that provide high degrees of horizontal and vertical scaling this scalability and redundancy allows us to provide high degrees of system availability our principal data center systems and applications are operated and managed by adp under a data center outsourcing services agreement we entered into with adp in march 2007 under this agreement adp is responsible for hosting a significant portion of our mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp all critical platforms are fully supported under adp’s disaster recovery program which provides geographic diversity and precise system application data and network recovery we continue to manage the application development information technology strategy and system architecture direction and management functions

we have the right to terminate the it services agreement for several reasons including for cause for convenience or in the event of a change of ownership control of ibm however several of the grounds for termination of the it services agreement by broadridge require us to pay a termination fee to ibm ibm also has certain termination rights in the event of a material breach of the company’s obligations under the it services agreement and its failure to cure

employees 

at june 30 2010 we had approximately 5400 employees none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company we believe that our employee relations are good 

regulation 

the securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets 

in the us the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws at the federal level the sec regulates the securities industry along with the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the various stock exchanges and other selfregulatory organizations “sros” our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec and nyse regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

  

on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue for public comment a concept release the “concept release” focusing on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec is seeking public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest comments on the concept release are due within 90 days of its publication and at the end of that period the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release it is too early in the process for the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec the sros or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the concept release if changes are made to the us proxy system we expect to continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices for example we are in the process of implementing changes to our services to enable our clients to comply with the recently enacted doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requirement that public companies include in their proxy materials a resolution subject to stockholder vote to approve the compensation of executives 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services in addition we engage independent auditors to review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their regulators 

as a registered brokerdealer our subsidiary ridge is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business including trade practices capital structure record retention money laundering prevention and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure by ridge to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of the directors officers or employees of such business in addition as a registered brokerdealer ridge is required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” for the benefit of the customers of our introducing brokerdealer clients in connection with our securities clearing services on june 25 2010 we completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all of ridge’s securities clearing clients and are in the process of winding down the securities clearing business which we expect to complete in fiscal year 2011 as we wind down that business ridge continues to perform securities clearing services on a limited basis until such wind down is complete ridge will continue to be subject to the regulatory requirements of a brokerdealer performing those functions these regulations include the sec’s customer protection rule which protects both the customer funds and customer securities the sec’s hypothecation rules 8c1 and 15c21 regarding the borrowing and lending of our correspondents’ customers’ securities regulation t which regulates the borrowing and lending of securities by brokerdealers and regulation sho which prohibits short sales in certain instances 

our operations outsourcing services are subject to regulatory oversight by the sec and finra the recent economic turmoil has resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing of regulatory functions this oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws 

  

or rules with respect to operations outsourcing we will monitor any future actions taken by the sec and finra and if new requirements are enacted we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements and industry practices in addition if we expand our outsourcing solutions services into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business 

our subsidiary stocktrans as a transfer agent is subject to certain rules and regulations promulgated by the sec including without limitation with respect to registration with the sec annual reporting internal controls proper disposal of consumer report information and obligations relating to stocktrans’ operations stocktrans has been formally approved by the nyse before commencing to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of nyse listed securities and is subject to certain nyse requirements concerning operational standards furthermore stocktrans is also subject to certain provisions of the grammleachbliley act and the federal trade commission’s regulations with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards 

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use storage and destruction of personal information in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions and various state privacy laws which apply to businesses that collect personal information apply directly to our subsidiaries ridge and stocktrans the grammleachbliley act and state privacy laws apply indirectly through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards to the entities that perform our investor communication and securities processing services the state privacy laws require notification to affected individuals state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information these regulations and laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures 

similar data privacy laws related to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information exist outside of the us such as the european union’s 9546 ec directive of the european parliament canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act individual european national laws and data privacy laws of other countries in some cases these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the grammleachbliley act or the us state privacy laws and may impose additional duties on companies 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

other 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the us and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

  

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry in recent years the economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2010 we derived approximately 25 of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 70 of the revenues of our securities processing solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation or nonrenewal of contracts would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations and the loss of any of these securities processing clients could result in a material adverse effect on the revenues and results of operations of our securities processing solutions segment at the end of a contract term our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted in addition the current economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various stock exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable also changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing our clients and the securities markets on july 14 2010 the sec voted unanimously to issue the concept release for public comment the concept release focuses on a wide range of topics related to the us proxy system the concept release is organized by the three general topics on which the sec is seeking public input 1 ensuring the accuracy transparency and efficiency of the voting process 2 enhancing shareholder communication and participation and 3 addressing the relationship between voting power and economic interest comments on the concept release are due within 

  

90 days of its publication and at the end of that period the sec may but is not necessarily required to engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the concept release it is too early in the process for the company to make a determination as to whether there will be any modifications made to the current proxy system and if so what impact if any any such modifications to the current proxy system will have on our business however as with any regulatory change we may have to incur additional costs to adapt our business to possible modifications in the proxy system that could result from the rulemaking process initiated by the concept release 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the ffiec council we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec has been conducting periodic reviews of certain of our operations since august 2006 in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition as a provider of services to financial institutions the operations outsourcing solutions provided by ridge are subject to regulatory oversight if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations we could be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings censures and fines our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients in addition the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to operations outsourcing could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of the operations outsourcing business furthermore regulatory approval may be required before expansion of our operations outsourcing business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in the number of unique securities positions trading volume market prices or the liquidity of the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our investor communications securities processing and operations outsourcing services these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets among other factors over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity including reduced proxy mutual fund and mergers and acquisitions communications processing and reduced trading volumes the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations 

  

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients trading volume market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets accordingly any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions and investors in public companies and mutual funds our clients are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed misused altered destroyed or otherwise compromised and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them in addition our subsidiaries ridge and stocktrans are subject to these laws and regulations we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards which vary based on service and information type including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet however despite those safeguards it is possible that hackers employees acting contrary to security policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers or investors in public companies and mutual funds any breach of our information security policies or safeguards resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of personal or account information could result in interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those breaches our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches furthermore such breaches could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from a third party data center services provider and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

adp provides us with data center services under a data center outsourcing services agreement that include hosting the mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp in march 2010 we entered into the it services agreement with ibm under which ibm will provide us with data center services we expect the migration to ibm to be completed by june 2012 and adp will continue to provide us with data center services until the migration to ibm is complete during the transition to ibm if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed in addition there is a risk that we may experience a disruption as a result of the transition from adp to ibm impacting the services we provide to our clients as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in our services agreements with adp and ibm however we may not adequately be protected against all possible losses through the terms of those agreements 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims client loss and result in reputational damage 

an intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our investor communications securities processing or operations outsourcing services could result in our clients andor ridge being subjected to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such errors could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 

our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes for example given recent industry and market events clients of our securities processing solutions business are increasingly focused on more sophisticated and comprehensive risk management models and practices to increase transparency exercise controls and minimize potential exposure our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services in addition our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt in addition we expect that the markets in which we 

  

compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies including international providers of similar products and services to ours having a lower cost structure there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 11 “borrowings” to our financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business with the exception of one recentlyhired executive officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business these systems and applications are primarily developed by employees or obtained through acquisitions our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients either through internal development acquisition or licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

  

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we have been and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 in the event of a disaster our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe natural disaster or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly in addition our outsourced data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place however we cannot be certain that our plans or those of our outsourced data center services provider will be successful in the event of a disaster if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage however we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage in addition such failures could cause us to lose revenues lose clients or damage our reputation 

  

the financial services business is highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenues and profitability for that period of time if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis

basis of presentation 

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company these financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 

in presenting the financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” “asc no 350” formerly financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 5095 million of goodwill as of june 30 2010 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill 

  

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with asc no 740 “income taxes” formerly sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition although currently not under any us or foreign income tax exam for the period march 31 2007 through june 30 2010 in the future we expect to be subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our financial statements as of june 30 2010 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 240 million as of june 30 2010 of which 87 million expires in 2011 through 2017 and 153 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 428 million which expire in 2020 through 2029 we have recorded valuation allowances of 159 million and 257 million at june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively because the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

sharebased payments  asc no 718 “compensation—stock compensation” formerly sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a 11 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a 04 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2010 stock option grants would result in approximately a 05 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2010 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

analysis of reportable segments 

as a result of broadridge entering into the asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the contracts of the securities clearing clients of ridge to pfsi broadridge now has two reportable operating business segments investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions the securities clearing business is reflected in discontinued operations see note 1 “basis of presentation” and note 7 “discontinued operations” for detailed information on discontinued operations and the operations outsourcing solutions business retained by broadridge is now reported as part of the securities processing solutions business segment this change is reflected in all prior periods presented in this report on form 10k 

  

the primary components of “other” are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segmentrelated expense items of an unusual or nonrecurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit

based upon current and anticipated levels of operation we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations combined with borrowings available under the credit facility will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs please refer to the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities 

cash flows 

net cash flows provided by operating activities were 3601 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 829 million compared to 2772 million net cash flows provided during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the increase reflects higher accrued expenses of 280 million and higher accounts payable of 239 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 due to the timing of payables and a decrease in the purchase of other current assets of 272 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 were 883 million a decrease of 24 million compared to 907 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the decrease reflects lower spending of 256 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 partially offset by increases in capital expenditures of 159 million and purchases of intangibles of 73 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 were 2781 million which represents an increase of 977 million compared to 1804 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the increase in net cash flows used in financing activities reflects 2334 million in higher repurchases of the company’s common stock intended to offset dilution from the company’s equity compensation plans and an increase of 287 million in dividends paid slightly offset by lower payments on longterm debt of 1144 million and 502 million in higher proceeds from exercise of stock options 

income taxes 

before the spinoff from our former parent company adp the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the spinoff the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax 

  

returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company 

the company headquartered in the us is routinely examined by the us internal revenue service the “irs” as part of the irs us federal income tax audit of adp and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the us states and foreign countries in which it conducts business the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction with respect to us federal income taxes the company was a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group through march 30 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidation the company is included in any irs examination of adp for periods up to and including march 30 2007 adp and the company are currently under irs audit for the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 which was substantially completed in fiscal year 2009 in addition the irs is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and adp the us federal income tax payable of the company for the period ended march 30 2007 will be assumed by adp in addition any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the irs attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier will be tax liabilities assumed by adp correspondingly any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2010 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period 

defined benefit pension plan 

the company sponsors a supplemental officer retirement plan the “broadridge sorp” the broadridge sorp is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation the amount charged to expense for the broadridge sorp was 12 million 06 million and 05 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively broadridge management believes the broadridge sorp expense is not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of june 30 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

offbalance sheet arrangements 

it is not the company’s business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes the company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 in the normal course of business the company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the company’s products and services the company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements

history and development of our company 

we are the former brokerage services division of adp broadridge financial solutions inc was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of adp on march 29 2007 in anticipation of our spinoff from adp on march 30 2007 we spun off from adp and began operating as an independent public 

  

company our company has more than 40 years of history of providing innovative solutions to the financial services industry and publiclyheld companies in 1962 the brokerage services division of adp opened for business with one client processing an average of 300 trades per day in 1979 we expanded our usbased securities processing solutions to process canadian securities 

we made significant additions to our securities processing solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid1990s in 1995 we acquired a londonbased provider of multicurrency clearance and settlement services to become a global supplier of transaction processing services in 1996 we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems 

we began offering our proxy services in 1989 the proxy services business which started what has become our investor communication solutions business leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our securities processing solutions business our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations in 1992 we acquired the independent election corporation of america which further increased our proxy services capabilities by 1999 we were handling over 90 of the investor communication distributions for all securities held of record by banks and brokerdealers in the us—from proxy statements to annual reports during the 1990s we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of canadian and united kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies 

in 1998 having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services in 2001 we developed and released postedge ® to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications 

in 2004 we entered the securities clearing business by purchasing bank of america corporation’s us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses the following year we commenced offering our unique business process outsourcing service to selfclearing us brokerdealers 

the broadridge business 

our operations are classified into three business segments investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

  

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers and investment companies 

the services we provide in this segment represented approximately 71 71 and 73 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively they include 

bank and brokerage offerings  we handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank and brokerdealer clients online and in realtime from coordination with thirdparty entities to ordering inventory maintenance mailing tracking and vote tabulation we offer electronic proxy delivery services for the electronic delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers posting of documents on the internet email notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available and proxy voting over the internet we also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors in addition we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies we also provide a complete reorganization communications solution to notify investors of reorganizations or corporate action events such as tender offers mergers and acquisitions bankruptcies and class action lawsuits 

we also offer our bank and brokerage clients financial information distribution and transaction reporting services to help them meet their regulatory compliance requirements and business needs including prospectus fulfillment services electronic prospectus services investor mailbox our service providing the electronic delivery of investor communications to our clients’ websites postedge ®  our electronic document archival and electronic delivery solution for documents including trade confirmations tax documents and account statements marketing communications imaging archival and workflow solutions and ondemand digital print services 

broadridge introduced the investor network to its bank and brokerage clients in fiscal year 2009 it is a comprehensive social network for validated investors the investor network provides a secure environment for investors to discuss their investments the economy and other marketrelated activity it can integrate directly with a brokerage firm’s customerfacing website this allows brokerage customers to participate as validated members without having to divulge personal and confidential information that other online social media sites typically require 

  

institutional investor offerings  we provide a suite of services to manage the entire proxy voting process of institutional investors including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs such as proxyedge ®  our workflow solution that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy voting can be instructed for the entire position by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers proxyedge ® also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting proxyedge ® can be utilized for meetings of us and canadian companies and for meetings in many nonnorth american countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients 

corporate issuer offerings  we are the largest processor and provider of investor communication solutions to public companies we offer our corporate issuer clients many tools to facilitate their communications with investors such as internet and telephone proxy voting electronic delivery of corporate filings and householding of communications to stockholders at the same address one of our opportunities for growth in the investor communication solutions segment involves serving corporate issuer clients in providing communications services to registered stockholders—that is stockholders who do not hold their shares through a brokerdealer in street name we also offer proxy services to nonnorth american corporate issuers in connection with their general and special meetings of stockholders our corporate issuer services include sharelink ®  our service that enables the creation and printing of personalized proxy forms in a variety of formats sharelink ® provides complete project management for the beneficial and registered proxy process 

broadridge introduced two investor communication solutions for corporate issuers in fiscal year 2009 they are the shareholder forum and virtual shareholder meeting solutions the shareholder forum is an online venue that offers public companies the ability to host structured controlled communication with their shareholders on a timely and regular basis validated shareholders can submit questions answer surveys in preparation of the annual meeting and yearround and communicate in various ways with a corporation broadridge’s virtual shareholder meeting service provides corporate issuers with the ability to host their annual meeting electronically on the internet either on a standalone basis or in conjunction with their physical annual meeting as the entity that provides beneficial shareholder proxy processing on behalf of many banks and brokerage firms broadridge can provide shareholder validation and voting to companies that want to hold virtual meetings

securities processing solutions 

transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution at that point the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse the records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction tax accounting and recordkeeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction the accurate processing of trading activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction

regulation 

the securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets 

in the us the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws at the federal level the sec regulates the securities industry along with the financial industry regulatory authority inc or finra the various stock exchanges and other sros companies that operate in these industries such as our subsidiary ridge clearing are subject to regulations concerning many aspects of their businesses including trade practices capital structure record retention money laundering prevention and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure by ridge clearing to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec authorization granted to allow the operation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business or disqualification of the directors officers or employees of such business 

  

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec and nyse regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review certain nyse rules regarding the roles and responsibilities of brokerdealers in the proxy process the proxy working group made recommendations in 2007 and certain of its recommendations have been approved or are pending approval by the sec the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications we continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under evolving legal requirements and industry practices however any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business for example if additional modifications to the current regulations are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services in addition we engage independent auditors to review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their regulators 

regulation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is conducted through our subsidiary ridge clearing a brokerdealer registered with the sec and a member of finra and various other sros our clearing and outsourcing solutions business operates in the regulatory environment discussed in the following paragraphs 

as a registered brokerdealer ridge clearing is required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” in the event of a brokerdealer member’s insolvency sipc provides protection of up to 500000 per customer with a limitation of 100000 on claims for cash balances additional protection or excess sipc is provided through a group of london underwriters with lloyd’s of london syndicates as the lead underwriter this additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that sipc limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of 600 million this is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a sipc liquidation this additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a trustee sipc and the london underwriters of 150 million including cash of up to 2 million it does not protect against losses from the rise and fall in the market value of investments and does not cover all assets such coverages are provided in connection with our securities clearing services and are for the benefit of all customers of our introducing brokerdealer clients 

  

regulation of clearing activities 

ridge clearing provides clearing services to introducing brokerdealers commonly referred to as “correspondents” with whom we are not affiliated errors in performing clearing functions including clerical technological and other errors related to the processing of securities transactions and the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of brokerdealers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities errors could also lead to losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our clients including our correspondents the customers of our correspondents and others 

regulatory capital and customer protection requirements 

as a registered brokerdealer and member of finra ridge clearing is subject to the sec’s net capital rule the net capital rule which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered brokerdealers is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a brokerdealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form the net capital rule provides specific criteria to measure regulatory net capital which requires the firm to apply deductions and other operational charges to its net worth to reflect illiquid assets these deductions also include adjustments which are commonly called “haircuts” which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of firm inventory before disposition the effects of securities lending and securities borrowing activities on net capital calculations are described in the “regulation of securities lending and borrowing” section below 

failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ridge clearing to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of ridge clearing the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends redemption of stock the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder employee or affiliate if such payment would reduce ridge clearing’s net capital below required levels 

the net capital rule also provides that the sec may restrict any capital withdrawal including the withdrawal of equity capital or unsecured loans or advances to stockholders employees or affiliates if such capital withdrawal together with all other net capital withdrawals during a 30day period exceeds 30 of excess net capital and the sec concludes that the capital withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the brokerdealer in addition the net capital rule provides that the total outstanding principal amount of a brokerdealer’s indebtedness under specified subordination agreements the proceeds of which are included in its net capital may not exceed 70 of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all subordinated indebtedness included in net capital par or stated value of capital stock paid in capital in excess of par retained earnings and other capital accounts for a period in excess of 90 days 

a change in the net capital rule the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit some of our securities clearing and operations outsourcing activities that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our clearing and outsourcing solutions business which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

in addition as a regulated brokerdealer ridge clearing is also subject to the sec’s customer protection rule the customer protection rule operates to protect both customer funds and customer securities to protect customer securities the customer protection rule requires that the brokerdealers promptly obtain possession or control of customers’ fully paid securities free of any lien however brokerdealers may lend or borrow customers’ securities purchased on margin or customers’ fully paid securities if the brokerdealer provides collateral exceeding the market value of the securities it borrowed and makes certain other disclosures to the customer with respect to customer funds the customer protection rule requires brokerdealers to make deposits into an account held only for the benefit of customers “reserve account” based on its computation of the reserve 

  

formula the reserve formula requires that brokerdealers compare the amount of funds it has received from customers or through the use of their securities “credits” to the amount of funds the firm has used to finance customer activities “debits” in this manner the customer protection rule ensures that the brokerdealer’s securities lending and borrowing activities do not impact the amount of funds available to customers in the event of liquidation 

regulation of securities lending and borrowing 

as part of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business ridge clearing engages in securities lending and borrowing transactions with other brokerdealers either by lending the securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other brokerdealers or by borrowing securities from banks or other brokerdealers to facilitate transactions by our correspondents 

securities lending and borrowing activities are subject to the sec’s net capital rule described above because engaging in securities lending and borrowing presents counterparty credit risk to the brokerdealer the provisions in the net capital rule require unsecured receivables to be deducted from the brokerdealer’s net worth when it computes its “net capital” in addition the net capital rule requires a 100 deduction of the amount by which the market value of securities loaned exceeds cash collateral received securities lending and borrowing activities are also subject to the sec’s customer protection rule the objective of which is to ensure that assets of the firm’s customers will be available to be distributed to them in the event of a liquidation of a registered brokerdealer 

sec rules 8c1 and 15c21 the “hypothecation rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” set forth requirements relating to the borrowing or lending of our correspondents’ customers’ securities the hypothecation rules prohibit us from borrowing or lending correspondents’ customers securities in situations where 1 the securities of one customer will be held together with securities of another customer without first obtaining the written consent of each customer 2 the securities of a customer will be held together with securities owned by a person or entity that is not a customer or 3 the securities of a customer will be subject to a lien for an amount in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all customers’ securities 

regulation t was issued by the federal reserve board pursuant to the exchange act in part to regulate the borrowing and lending of securities by brokerdealers although regulation t allows brokerdealers to deposit cash in order to secure the borrowing of securities for the purpose of making deliveries of such securities in the cases of short sales failures to receive securities they are required to deliver or other similar cases and to lend securities for such purposes against such a deposit it also includes provisions regarding the provision of collateral for example under the provisions of regulation t brokerdealers are generally required to collect cash equal to 50 of the value of equity securities purchased in a margin account however we may require the deposit of a higher percentage of the value of equity securities purchased on margin securities borrowed transactions are extensions of credit to the securities lender in that the lender generally receives cash collateral that exceeds the market value of the securities that were lent 

with respect to such securities borrowing and lending regulation sho issued under the exchange act generally prohibits among other things a brokerdealer from accepting a short sale order unless either the brokerdealer has borrowed the security or entered into a bonafide arrangement to borrow the security or has “reasonable grounds” to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with this requirement 

failure to maintain the required net capital accurately compute the reserve formula or comply with regulation t or regulation sho may subject ridge clearing to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business a change in the net capital rule the hypothecation rules the customer protection rule regulation t regulation sho or the imposition of new rules 

  

could adversely impact our ability to engage in securities lending and borrowing which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock 

margin risk management 

our margin lending activities expose the capital of ridge clearing to significant risks these risks include but are not limited to absolute and relative price movements price volatility and changes in liquidity of the underlying margin collateral over which we have virtually no control 

we attempt to minimize the risks inherent in our margin lending activities by retaining in our margin lending agreements the ability to adjust margin requirements as needed and by exercising a high degree of selectivity when accepting new correspondents when determining whether to accept a new correspondent we evaluate among other factors the brokerage firm’s experience in the industry its financial condition and the background of the principals of the firm in addition we have multiple layers of protection including the balances in customers’ accounts correspondents’ commissions on deposit and clearing deposits provided by correspondent firms in the event that a correspondent or one of its customers does not deliver payment for our services we also maintain a bad debt reserve our customer agreements and fullydisclosed clearing agreements require industry arbitration in the event of a dispute arbitration is generally less expensive and more time efficient than dispute resolution through the court system although we attempt to minimize the risk associated with our margin lending activities there is no assurance that the assumptions on which we base our decisions will be correct or that we are in a position to predict factors or events which will have an adverse impact on any individual client or issuer or the securities markets in general 

state regulation 

ridge clearing is a brokerdealer authorized to conduct business in all 50 states under applicable state securities regulations 

changes in our business and the regulatory environment 

in addition we may expand our clearing and outsourcing solutions business into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business the securities and financial services industries are heavily regulated in many foreign countries the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to expand internationally 

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions and various state privacy laws which apply to businesses that collect personal information apply directly to our subsidiary ridge clearing the grammleachbliley act and state privacy laws apply indirectly through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards to the entities that perform our investor communication and securities processing services the state privacy laws require notification to affected individuals state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach of computer databases or physical documents that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information these regulations and laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures 

similar data privacy laws related to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information exist outside of the us such as the european union’s 9546 ec directive of the european parliament canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act individual european national laws and data 

  

privacy laws of other countries in some cases these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the grammleachbliley act or the us state privacy laws and may impose additional duties on companies 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

other 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the us and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

segment and geographic area financial information 

you can find financial information regarding our operating segments and our geographic areas in note 19 “financial data by segment” to our consolidated and combined financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company in each of the noted risk categories i risks relating to our business ii risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business and iii risks relating to our separation from adp however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the current economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients due to this recent consolidation activity one of the 15 largest clients of our securities processing solutions business has 

  

recently acquired a financial institution that performs inhouse some of the securities processing services that we provide and as a result it has notified us that it intends to terminate these services this client generated 230 million 197 million and 161 million of revenues during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively from the services that are being terminated 

a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2009 we derived approximately 27 of our revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 70 of the revenues of our securities processing solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment our largest single client accounted for between 67 of our consolidated revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation or nonrenewal of contracts would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations and the loss of any of these securities processing solutions clients could result in a material adverse effect on the revenues and results of operations of our securities processing solutions segment the current economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients due to this recent consolidation activity one of the 15 largest clients of our securities processing solutions business has recently acquired a financial institution that performs inhouse some of the securities processing services that we provide and as a result it has notified us that it intends to terminate these services 

at the end of a contract term clients have the opportunity to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted the current economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business in connection with the recent renewal and extension of some contracts with our securities processing solutions clients the increased pricing pressure has resulted in a higher than historical average rate of price concessions these contract renewal price concessions are estimated to be approximately 5 of our annual securities processing solutions segment’s revenues compared with the historical average rate of 3 of the annual securities processing solutions segment’s revenues 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various securities exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec and nyse regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

  

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review certain nyse rules regarding the roles and responsibilities of brokerdealers in the proxy process the proxy working group made recommendations in 2007 and certain of its recommendations have been approved or are pending approval by the sec the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications we continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under evolving legal requirements and industry practices however any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business for example if additional modifications to the current regulations are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the ffiec we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in trading volume market prices or the liquidity of the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our investor communication securities processing and clearing and outsourcing services including the interest income from our margin lending activities and interest earned by investing clients’ cash these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market values of securities can result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions activities 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions our clients are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them in addition our brokerdealer subsidiary ridge clearing is subject to these laws and regulations we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet in addition adp as our data center services provider has information security safeguards in place however despite those safeguards it is possible that hackers employees acting contrary to security policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers any breach of our security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal or account information of our clients’ customers could limit our ability to provide services hinder the growth of our business and subject us to litigation or damage our reputation in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of network or internet security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp and if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

prior to our spinoff from adp we combined our primary data center with adp’s data center in connection with our separation from adp we entered into a multiyear data center outsourcing services agreement with adp pursuant to which adp provides us with data center services consistent with the services provided to us immediately before the spinoff provided that the operation of the data center is the sole responsibility of adp the services include hosting the mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp adp has not ordinarily provided outsourced data center services if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our agreement with adp is terminated for any reason we may not be able to find an alternative data center services provider in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms if we need to build our own information technology infrastructure we may incur substantial costs and could experience temporary business interruptions as a result we may not be able to meet the demands of our clients and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed in addition technology service failures could have adverse regulatory consequences for our clearing and outsourcing solutions business some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in our data center outsourcing services agreement with adp nevertheless we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of the agreement 

  

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of adp as our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause the customers of our clients to suffer delays in their receipt of investor communications or in the execution of their trades these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and could subject us to claims and losses including litigation claiming fraud or negligence that could damage our reputation increase our service costs cause us to lose revenues andor divert our technical resources 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 11 “borrowings” to our financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis because we utilize the systems of our outsourced data center we will depend on adp to keep the processing capacity and speed of the data center in line with the growth of our business 

  

in addition with respect to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has increased we have implemented and continue to implement formal compliance procedures to respond to these changes the future operating results of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business will depend on our ability 

 

  

  

 our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global securities industry is characterized by increasingly complex infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes for example given recent industry and market events clients of our securities processing solutions business are increasingly focused on more sophisticated and comprehensive operational risk management models and practices to increase transparency exercise controls and minimize potential exposure our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the market for our products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services to our market in addition we compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions some of our competitors may possess significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors may also offer a wider range of services than we do and may enjoy greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than ours these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions businesses we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified 

  

personnel is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

the inability to identify obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business 

our success depends in part upon the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business these systems and applications are primarily developed by employees or obtained through acquisitions our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients either through internal development acquisition or licensing from others or alliances with others our inability to identify obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business or to timely introduce new and innovative technologybased products and services which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we have been and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

trading volume market prices and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by the volume of trading activities of our clients our margin lending revenues are also impacted by changes in the trading activities of our correspondents accordingly any significant reduction in activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the financial services business is highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenues and profitability for that period of time if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies 

  

and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our existing clearing correspondents may choose to perform their own securities clearing services as their operations grow 

we market our securities clearing services to our existing correspondent clients on the strength of our ability to process transactions and perform related backoffice functions more effectively than these clients could perform these functions themselves as our correspondent clients’ operations grow they often consider the option of performing securities clearing functions themselves in a process referred to in the securities industry as “selfclearing” as the transaction volume of a brokerdealer grows the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for selfclearing may be eventually offset by the elimination of pertransaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm additionally performing their own securities clearing services allows selfclearing brokerdealers to retain their customers’ margin balances free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities if a significant number of clearing correspondents or correspondents representing a significant portion of our business terminate their clearing relationship with us to become selfclearing this could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we address this potential client loss by offering our operations outsourcing service which affords firms an ability to remain or become selfclearing without the necessity of maintaining this infrastructure however some firms may nevertheless choose to change to selfclearing operations and not outsource their operations to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our securities clearing business may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our securities clearing activities involve transaction execution clearing and settlement services and financing of client inventory through margin lending with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations furthermore the margin loans we provide to investors subject us to risks inherent in extending credit our credit risk includes the risk that the market value of the collateral we hold could fall below the amount of an investor’s indebtedness this risk is especially great when the market value of the collateral becomes highly volatile our agreements with margin account investors permit us to liquidate their securities with or without prior notice in the event that the amount of margin collateral becomes insufficient despite those agreements and our internal policy with respect to margin which may be more restrictive than is required under applicable laws and regulations we may be unable to liquidate the customers’ securities for various reasons including the fact that 

 

  

  

 our margin lending is subject to the margin rules of the federal reserve board and finra whose rules generally permit margin loans of up to 50 of the value of the securities collateralizing the margin account loan at the time the loan is made subject to requirements that the customer deposit additional securities or cash in its accounts so that the customers’ equity in the account is at least 25 of the value of the securities in the account in certain circumstances we may provide a higher degree of margin leverage to our correspondents with respect to their proprietary trading businesses as a result we may increase the risks otherwise associated with margin lending with respect to these correspondents and customer accounts 

  

our practice of recording securities clearing transactions may expose us to offbalance sheet risk of loss 

we record clients’ securities clearing transactions on a settlement date basis which is generally three business days after the trade date we are therefore exposed to offbalance sheet risk of loss on unsettled transactions in the event clients and other counterparties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our securities clearing business may be subject to liability under our membership agreements with exchanges and clearinghouses 

we are a member of numerous exchanges and clearinghouses under the membership agreements members are generally required to guarantee the performance of other members additionally if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse other members would be required to meet these shortfalls to mitigate these performance risks the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral we may be subject to liability under these arrangements in case of default of a member of those exchanges or clearinghouses 

the involvement of our securities clearing business in options markets subjects us to risks inherent in conducting business in those markets 

we clear options contracts on behalf of our correspondents and their customers trading in options contracts is generally more highly leveraged than trading in other types of securities this additional leverage increases the risk associated with trading in options contracts which in turn raises the risk that a correspondent or customer may not be able to fully repay its creditors including us if it experiences losses in its options trading 

our securities clearing and operations outsourcing services could expose us to legal liability for errors in performing clearing or operations outsourcing services and in connection with our clearing services for improper activities of our correspondents 

any intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services or any mishandling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our correspondents and their customers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable authorities as well as actions in contract or tort brought by parties who are financially harmed by those failures or mishandlings any litigation that arises as a result of our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services could harm our reputation and cause us to incur substantial expenses associated with litigation and damage awards that could exceed our liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts 

in the past clearing firms in the us have been held liable for failing to take action upon the receipt of customer complaints failing to know about the suspicious activities of correspondents or their customers under circumstances where they should have known and even aiding and abetting or causing the improper activities of their correspondents we cannot assure you that our procedures regarding our correspondents will be deemed adequate under current laws and regulations or that securities industry regulators will not enact more restrictive laws or regulations or change their interpretations of current laws and regulations if we fail to implement proper procedures or fail to adapt our existing procedures to new or more restrictive regulations we may be subject to liability that could result in substantial costs to us and distract our management from our business 

all aspects of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business are subject to extensive regulation which may subject us to disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations 

the securities industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in addition to these laws our clearing and outsourcing services must comply with rules and regulations of the sec finra various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets brokerdealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the establishment and maintenance of an effective compliance system as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations in the future if a claim of noncompliance is made by a regulatory authority the efforts of our management could be diverted to responding to such claim and we could be subject to a range of possible consequences including the payment of fines and the suspension of one or more portions of our business additionally some of our securities clearing services contracts include automatic termination provisions which are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 

in addition because our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required before expansion of our business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets for further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate see item 1 of part i “business—regulation” in this annual report on form 10k 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is subject to complex regulations the violation of which could expose us to interruptions in our business and monetary liability from regulators clients competitors and others 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and costly changes in laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business the costs of the compliance requirements we face and the constraints they impose on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses 

if our securities clearing business does not maintain the capital levels required by regulations or does not follow the requirements of the customer protection rule we may be subject to fines suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by regulatory authorities 

our securities clearing business is subject to stringent rules imposed by the sec finra and various other regulatory agencies which require brokerdealers to maintain specific levels of net capital and to protect customer funds and customer securities net capital is the net worth of a brokerdealer less deductions for certain assets including assets not readily convertible into cash and specified percentages of certain securities positions if we fail to maintain the required net capital or fail to protect customer funds or customer securities we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra which if not cured could ultimately lead to the liquidation of ridge clearing if the net capital rules are changed or expanded or if there is an unusually large charge against the net capital of ridge clearing we might be required to limit or discontinue our securities clearing and margin lending operations that require the intensive use of capital in addition our ability to withdraw capital from ridge clearing could be restricted which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock if necessary a large operating loss or charge against the net capital of our securities clearing business could impede our ability to expand or even maintain our present volume of business 

  

procedures and requirements of the usa patriot act may expose our securities clearing business to significant costs or penalties 

as a participant in the financial services industry our securities clearing business is subject to laws and regulations including the usa patriot act of 2001 which require that we know certain information about our securities clearing services clients and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities the cost of complying with the usa patriot act and related laws and regulations is significant we may face particular difficulties in identifying our international clients and gathering the required information about them we face risks that our policies procedures technology and personnel directed toward complying with the usa patriot act are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties due to noncompliance such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our separation from adp 

we have agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the treatment of the distribution as taxfree to adp and its stockholders which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility 

the irs ruling and opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution relied on certain representations and undertakings from us and the taxfree status of the distribution could be affected if these representations and undertakings are not correct or are violated if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment it will be treated as a taxable dividend to adp stockholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of our stock issued to adp stockholders in that event adp would be required to recognize a gain equal to the excess of the sum of the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date and the amount of cash received in the cash distribution over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

in addition current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to adp but not to its stockholders if we or our stockholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the twoyear period beginning on the distribution date unless it is established that the distribution and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership in the case of such a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership tax imposed on adp in respect of the distribution would be based on the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we are generally prohibited with a number of specified exceptions for specified periods of up to 30 months following the distribution from 

 

  

  

  

  

 we have agreed to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses resulting from certain actions that may cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we agreed generally to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses it suffers as a result of the distribution failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction if the taxes and related losses are attributable to 

 

   

  

 see item 1 of part i “the separation of broadridge from adp—tax allocation agreement” of this annual report on form 10k our indemnity covers both corporate level taxes and related losses imposed on adp in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership described in the preceding risk factor as well as taxes and related losses imposed on both adp and its stockholders if due to our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the distribution is determined to be taxable for other reasons 

the indemnification obligation to adp for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could be substantial and it is unlikely that we would have the resources to satisfy it 

our historical financial information for the periods before our separation from adp is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k for the periods before our spinoff from adp does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods before our separation from adp or that we may achieve in the future see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—factors affecting comparability of financial results—historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity”

separation of broadridge from adp 

the spinoff of broadridge by adp became effective on march 30 2007 through a distribution of 100 of the common stock of the company to the holders of record of adp common stock the “distribution” the distribution was effected pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement by which adp contributed to the company the subsidiaries that operated its brokerage services business adp distributed all of the shares of broadridge financial solutions inc as a dividend on adp common stock on march 30 2007 to all stockholders of record as of march 23 2007 

in connection with the spinoff we made a cash payment to adp on march 30 2007 of 6900 million which was financed through borrowings under 11900 million of credit facilities that were entered into on march 29 2007 the payment is reflected as a dividend to adp in stockholders’ equity 

a significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by adp such as investment banking fees related outside legal and accounting fees office move costs costs to separate information systems and temporary consulting costs broadridge incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to the company including stock compensation expense relating to the distribution and other items such as relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to the company and the temporary labor costs incurred to develop ongoing processes for operating on a standalone basis 

factors affecting comparability of financial results 

historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity 

our historical financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operations of the former brokerage services business of adp the combined financial statements for periods before the distribution include allocated costs for facilities functions and services used by the brokerage services business at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the brokerage services business based on usage our management believes these allocation methods are reasonable 

as an independent public company we are responsible for these services and bear all of these expenses directly the historical allocation of adp’s expenses to us may be significantly less than the actual costs we will incur as an independent company for the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 and 2008 and for the period from the date of the distribution to june 30 2007 the company incurred approximately 364 million 266 million and 80 million respectively in public company related expenses 

acquisitions and divestitures 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates the results of operations of businesses acquired by the company were included in the company’s consolidated and combined statements of earnings since their respective dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 

the company acquired one business in the investor communication solutions segment in fiscal year 2009 for 452 million this acquisition resulted in approximately 314 million of goodwill intangible assets acquired which totaled approximately 130 million consist primarily of acquired technology and customer 

  

relationships that are being amortized over a fiveyear life and sevenyear life respectively this acquisition was not material to the company’s operations financial position or cash flows 

the company acquired one business in the securities processing solutions segment in fiscal year 2009 for 137 million in addition the company agreed to pay contingent consideration subject to the acquired business’ achievement of specified revenue targets the maximum remaining payout based on the achievement of fiscal year 2010 revenue target is 109 million this acquisition resulted in approximately 112 million of goodwill intangible assets acquired which totaled approximately 38 million consist primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships that are being amortized over a fiveyear life and sevenyear life respectively this acquisition was not material to the company’s operations financial position or cash flows 

the company acquired one business in the securities processing solutions segment in fiscal year 2008 for 61 million this acquisition resulted in approximately 36 million of goodwill intangible assets acquired which totaled approximately 25 million consist of acquired technology that is being amortized over a fiveyear life this acquisition was not material to the company’s operations financial position or cash flows 

borrowings 

on march 29 2007 the company entered into a 11900 million senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a 4400 million fiveyear term loan facility a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 2500 million oneyear revolving credit facility on march 29 2007 the company borrowed 4400 million under the fiveyear term loan facility and 2500 million under the oneyear revolving credit facility the proceeds received in connection with the 6900 million of borrowings were paid to adp on march 30 2007 as a dividend these credit facilities are subject to covenants including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at june 30 2009 and 2008 the company was not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the financial covenants of these credit facilities during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 the company repaid zero 1700 million and 700 million respectively of the fiveyear term loan facility the oneyear revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on may 29 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6125 senior notes due 2017 the “senior notes” and cash the terms of the senior notes are governed by an indenture dated as of may 29 2007 by and between broadridge and us bank national association as trustee thereunder the senior notes are unsecured obligations of broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of broadridge interest is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6125 during fiscal year 2009 the company completed the purchase of 1250 million principal amount of the senior notes including 10 million unamortized bond discount pursuant to the cash tender offer for such notes the consideration paid for the senior notes accepted for payment was 1163 million the completed purchase resulted in a onetime noncash gain from early extinguishment of debt of 84 million please refer to note 11 “borrowings” to our financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

basis of presentation 

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company as a separate stand alone entity subsequent to the distribution presented along with the historical operations of the brokerage services business on a combined basis which were operated as part of adp before the distribution these financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts included in retained earnings reflect the company’s net earnings subsequent to the distribution the company’s combined results of operations and cash flows for periods before the distribution may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its results of operations and cash flows would have been had the company 

  

operated as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented including changes in its operations and capitalization as a result of the separation from adp in particular interest expense and corporate overhead costs are higher in the periods after the distribution than they were before the distribution in addition the consolidated and combined statements of earnings for the period before the distribution include a trademark royalty fee charged by adp to the company based on revenues for licensing fees associated with the use of the adp trademark after the distribution such royalties are no longer charged to the company 

in presenting the financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

the financial statements for periods before the distribution include costs for facilities functions and services used by the company at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the company based on usage the expenses allocated to the company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate independent entity and had otherwise managed these functions following the separation from adp the company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services certain of which were provided by adp during a transitional period pursuant to the transition services agreement see note 17 “transactions with former parent” to the financial statements for a detailed description of the company’s transactions with adp subsequent to the distribution 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 5111 million of goodwill as of june 30 2009 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current 

  

year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition although currently not under any us or foreign income tax exam for the period march 31 2007 through june 30 2009 in the future we expect to be subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our financial statements as of june 30 2009 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 234 million as of june 30 2009 of which 73 million expires in 2010 through 2016 and 161 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition the company has estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 458 million which expire in 2020 through 2029 284 million of which relates to a us subsidiary not included the company’s us federal consolidated tax return we have recorded valuation allowances of 257 million and 298 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively because the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

sharebased payments  sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2009 stock option grants would result in approximately a 08 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2009 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2009 stock option grants would result in approximately a 04 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2009 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2009 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2009 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2009 stock option grants would result in approximately a 05 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2009 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period 

recent developments 

the current economic slowdown and in particular its impact on the financial services industry has resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients and could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide one of the 15 largest clients of our securities processing solutions business has recently acquired a financial institution that performs inhouse some of the securities processing services that we provide and as a result it has notified us that it intends to terminate these services this client generated 230 million 197 million and 161 million of revenues during the fiscal years ended 

  

june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively from the services that are being terminated we will however continue to provide this client with certain investor communications and securities processing services 

also the current economic conditions have caused increased pricing pressure particularly with respect to our securities processing solutions business in connection with the recent renewal and extension of some contracts with our securities processing solutions clients the increased pricing pressure has resulted in a higher than historical average rate of price concessions these contract renewal price concessions are estimated to be approximately 5 of our annual securities processing solutions segment’s revenues compared with the historical average rate of 3 of the annual securities processing solutions segment’s revenues

analysis of reportable segments

based upon current and anticipated levels of operation we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations combined with borrowings available under the credit facility will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements capital expenditures and working capital needs please refer to note 12 “regulatory requirements” to our financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities 

cash flows 

the cash flows from operating and financing activities for our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment differ from that of our other businesses brokerdealer and customer margin activities and transactions require the company to obtain financing from both internal and external sources additionally regulations associated with the brokerdealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers’ balances as a result management analyzes the securities clearing activities cash flows of the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment separately from all other businesses 

within operating activities increases in securities clearing receivables and cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes and securities deposited with clearing organizations are respectively a use or a source of cash this can be funded by an increase or applied as a decrease to securities clearing payables reflected within operating activities or shortterm borrowings reflected within financing activities 

net cash flows provided by operating activities were as follows 

 

 net cash flows provided by operating activities excluding securities clearing activities were 2823 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 a decrease of 537 million compared to 3360 million net cash flows provided during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 trade accounts receivable decreased during the prior year by 870 million and further decreased in the current year by 317 million this change of 553 million is the primary reason that net cash flows provided by operating activities excluding securities clearing activities decreased by 537 million despite an improvement in collections of trade accounts receivable 

net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities at our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 765 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 a decrease of 695 million compared to net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities at our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment of 1460 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the decrease in cash flows provided is due to an increase in cash 

  

and securities segregated for regulatory purposes and a decline in securities clearing payables primarily driven by decreased securities lending activities this was partially offset by a decline in net securities clearing receivables due to lower margin balances 

net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were 907 million an increase of 381 million compared to 526 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the increase reflects higher spending of 547 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of 146 million 

net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were 1886 million and includes the company’s purchase of 1250 million principal amount of the senior notes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 this represents a decrease of 1318 million compared to 3204 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities reflects 556 million in lower payments on longterm debt and 1284 million in lower payments on shortterm borrowings offset by 336 million in higher repurchases of the company’s common stock intended to offset dilution from the company’s equity compensation plans 130 million in lower proceeds from exercise of stock options and an increase of 43 million in dividends paid 

the aforementioned 1284 million in lower payments on shortterm borrowings within the change in net cash flows used in financing activities reflects 1366 million of payments for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 funded by net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities of 1460 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities of 765 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were used to increase cash held at the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment by 680 million 

income taxes 

before the distribution the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the distribution the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company the payment of income taxes by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company is recorded within adp’s net investment on the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity

of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2009 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the combined financial condition of the company or on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period

history and development of our company 

we are the former brokerage services division of adp broadridge financial solutions inc was incorporated in delaware as a whollyowned subsidiary of adp on march 29 2007 in anticipation of our spinoff from adp on march 30 2007 we spun off from adp and began operating as an independent public company our company has more than 40 years of history of providing innovative solutions to the financial services industry and publiclyheld companies in 1962 the brokerage services division of adp opened for business with one client processing an average of 300 trades per night in 1979 we expanded our usbased securities processing solutions to process canadian securities 

we made significant additions to our securities processing solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid1990s in 1995 we acquired a londonbased provider of multicurrency clearance and settlement services to become a global supplier of transaction processing services in 1996 we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems in fiscal year 2008 we processed on average approximately 3 trillion daily in fixed income trades 

we began offering our proxy services in 1989 the proxy services business which started what has become our investor communication solutions business leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our securities processing solutions business our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations in 1992 we acquired the independent election corporation of america which further increased our proxy services capabilities by 1999 we were handling over 90 of the investor communication distributions for all securities held of record by banks and brokerdealers in the us—from proxy statements to annual reports during the 1990s we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of canadian and united kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies 

in 1998 having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services in 2001 we developed and released postedge ® to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications 

in 2004 we entered the securities clearing business by purchasing bank of america corporation’s us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses the following year we commenced offering our unique business process outsourcing service to selfclearing us brokerdealers 

the broadridge business 

our operations are classified into three business segments investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publiclytraded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokerdealers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokerdealers and banks these participant brokerdealers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are 

  

required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the brokerdealer or bank 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

the securities and exchange commission’s the “sec” rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokerdealers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process 

we also provide proxy distribution vote tabulation and various additional investor communication tools and services to institutional investors corporate issuers and investment companies 

the services we provide in this segment represented approximately 71 73 and 72 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively they include

securities processing solutions 

transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution at that point the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse the records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction tax accounting and recordkeeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction the accurate processing of trading activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our investor communication solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions including transfer agents who handle communication services to registered nonbeneficial securities holders proxy advisory firms proxy solicitation firms and other proxy services providers we also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling and printing of transaction confirmations and account statements our securities processing solutions business principally competes with brokerage firms that perform their trade processing inhouse and with numerous other outsourcing vendors our clearing and outsourcing solutions business competes with other financial institutions that offer correspondent clearing and execution services our backoffice support services offered through this segment also compete with very large financial institutions that both clear transactions and manage their own backoffice recordkeeping operations in many cases clients engage us only to perform certain functions such as backoffice processing and do not outsource certain functions that we would also perform for them such as clearing transactions

employees 

at june 30 2008 we had approximately 4850 employees none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company we believe that our employee relations are good 

regulation 

the securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the us and in other jurisdictions as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets 

in the us the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws at the federal level the sec regulates the securities industry along with the financial industry regulatory authority inc or finra the entity formed from the july 2007 consolidation of the national association of securities dealers and the member regulation enforcement and arbitration functions of the nyse the various stock exchanges and other selfregulatory organizations “sros” companies that operate in these industries such as our subsidiary ridge clearing are subject to regulations concerning many aspects of their businesses including trade practices capital structure record retention money laundering prevention and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees a failure by ridge clearing to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec authorization granted to allow the operation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business or disqualification of the directors officers or employees of such business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec and nyse regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review certain nyse rules regarding the roles and responsibilities of brokerdealers in the proxy process the proxy working group made recommendations in 2007 and certain of its recommendations are pending approval by the sec the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications we continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under evolving legal requirements and industry practices however any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business 

  

for example if additional modifications to the current regulations are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services in addition we engage independent auditors to review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their regulators 

regulation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is conducted through our subsidiary ridge clearing a brokerdealer registered with the sec and a member of finra and various other sros our clearing and outsourcing solutions business operates in the regulatory environment discussed in the following paragraphs 

as a registered brokerdealer ridge clearing is required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” in the event of a brokerdealer member’s insolvency sipc provides protection of up to 500000 per customer with a limitation of 100000 on claims for cash balances additional protection “excess sipc” is provided through customer asset protection company a vermontlicensed insurer excess sipc increases account protection up to the net equity of the customer account but does not protect against losses from the rise and fall in the market value of investments and does not cover all assets such coverages are provided in connection with our securities clearing services and are for the benefit of all customers of our introducing brokerdealer clients 

regulation of clearing activities 

ridge clearing provides clearing services to introducing brokerdealers commonly referred to as “correspondents” with whom we are not affiliated errors in performing clearing functions including clerical technological and other errors related to the processing of securities transactions and the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of brokerdealers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities errors could also lead to losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our clients including our correspondents the customers of our correspondents and others 

regulatory capital and customer protection requirements 

as a registered brokerdealer and member of finra ridge clearing is subject to the sec’s net capital rule the net capital rule which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered brokerdealers is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a brokerdealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form the net capital rule provides specific criteria to measure regulatory net capital which requires the firm to apply deductions and other operational charges to its net worth to reflect illiquid assets these deductions also include adjustments which are commonly called “haircuts” which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of firm inventory before disposition the effects of securities lending and securities borrowing activities on net capital calculations are described in the “regulation of securities lending and borrowing” section below 

  

failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ridge clearing to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of ridge clearing the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends redemption of stock the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder employee or affiliate if such payment would reduce ridge clearing’s net capital below required levels 

the net capital rule also provides that the sec may restrict any capital withdrawal including the withdrawal of equity capital or unsecured loans or advances to stockholders employees or affiliates if such capital withdrawal together with all other net capital withdrawals during a 30day period exceeds 30 of excess net capital and the sec concludes that the capital withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the brokerdealer in addition the net capital rule provides that the total outstanding principal amount of a brokerdealer’s indebtedness under specified subordination agreements the proceeds of which are included in its net capital may not exceed 70 of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all subordinated indebtedness included in net capital par or stated value of capital stock paid in capital in excess of par retained earnings and other capital accounts for a period in excess of 90 days 

a change in the net capital rule the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit some of our securities clearing and operations outsourcing activities that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our clearing and outsourcing solutions business which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

in addition as a regulated brokerdealer ridge clearing is also subject to the sec’s customer protection rule the customer protection rule operates to protect both customer funds and customer securities to protect customer securities the customer protection rule requires that the brokerdealers promptly obtain possession or control of customers’ fully paid securities free of any lien however brokerdealers may lend or borrow customers’ securities purchased on margin or customers’ fully paid securities if the brokerdealer provides collateral exceeding the market value of the securities it borrowed and makes certain other disclosures to the customer with respect to customer funds the customer protection rule requires brokerdealers to make deposits into an account held only for the benefit of customers “reserve account” based on its computation of the reserve formula the reserve formula requires that brokerdealers compare the amount of funds it has received from customers or through the use of their securities “credits” to the amount of funds the firm has used to finance customer activities “debits” in this manner the customer protection rule ensures that the brokerdealer’s securities lending and borrowing activities do not impact the amount of funds available to customers in the event of liquidation 

regulation of securities lending and borrowing 

as part of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business ridge clearing engages in securities lending and borrowing transactions with other brokerdealers either by lending the securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other brokerdealers or by borrowing securities from banks or other brokerdealers to facilitate transactions by our correspondents 

securities lending and borrowing activities are subject to the sec’s net capital rule described above because engaging in securities lending and borrowing presents counterparty credit risk to the brokerdealer the provisions in the net capital rule require unsecured receivables to be deducted from the brokerdealer’s net worth when it computes its “net capital” in addition the net capital rule requires a 100 deduction of the amount by which the market value of securities loaned exceeds cash collateral received securities lending and borrowing activities are also subject to the sec’s customer protection rule the objective of which is to ensure that assets of the firm’s customers will be available to be distributed to them in the event of a liquidation of a registered brokerdealer 

  

sec rules 8c1 and 15c21 the “hypothecation rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” set forth requirements relating to the borrowing or lending of our correspondents’ customers’ securities the hypothecation rules prohibit us from borrowing or lending correspondents’ customers securities in situations where 1 the securities of one customer will be held together with securities of another customer without first obtaining the written consent of each customer 2 the securities of a customer will be held together with securities owned by a person or entity that is not a customer or 3 the securities of a customer will be subject to a lien for an amount in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all customers’ securities 

regulation t was issued by the board of governors of the us federal reserve “federal reserve” pursuant to the exchange act in part to regulate the borrowing and lending of securities by brokerdealers although regulation t allows brokerdealers to deposit cash in order to secure the borrowing of securities for the purpose of making deliveries of such securities in the cases of short sales failures to receive securities they are required to deliver or other similar cases and to lend securities for such purposes against such a deposit it also includes provisions regarding the provision of collateral for example under the provisions of regulation t brokerdealers are generally required to collect cash equal to 50 of the value of equity securities purchased in a margin account however we may require the deposit of a higher percentage of the value of equity securities purchased on margin securities borrowed transactions are extensions of credit to the securities lender in that the lender generally receives cash collateral that exceeds the market value of the securities that were lent 

with respect to such securities borrowing and lending regulation sho issued under the exchange act generally prohibits among other things a brokerdealer from accepting a short sale order unless either the brokerdealer has borrowed the security or entered into a bonafide arrangement to borrow the security or has “reasonable grounds” to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with this requirement 

failure to maintain the required net capital accurately compute the reserve formula or comply with regulation t or regulation sho may subject ridge clearing to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business a change in the net capital rule the hypothecation rules the customer protection rule regulation t regulation sho or the imposition of new rules could adversely impact our ability to engage in securities lending and borrowing which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock 

margin risk management 

our margin lending activities expose the capital of ridge clearing to significant risks these risks include but are not limited to absolute and relative price movements price volatility and changes in liquidity of the underlying margin collateral over which we have virtually no control 

we attempt to minimize the risks inherent in our margin lending activities by retaining in our margin lending agreements the ability to adjust margin requirements as needed and by exercising a high degree of selectivity when accepting new correspondents when determining whether to accept a new correspondent we evaluate among other factors the brokerage firm’s experience in the industry its financial condition and the background of the principals of the firm in addition we have multiple layers of protection including the balances in customers’ accounts correspondents’ commissions on deposit and clearing deposits provided by correspondent firms in the event that a correspondent or one of its customers does not deliver payment for our services we also maintain a bad debt reserve our customer agreements and fullydisclosed clearing agreements require industry arbitration in the event of a dispute arbitration is generally less expensive and more time efficient than dispute resolution through the court system although we attempt to minimize the risk associated with our margin lending activities there is no assurance that the assumptions on which we base our decisions will be correct or that we are in a position to predict factors or events which will have an adverse impact on any individual client or issuer or the securities markets in general 

  

state regulation 

ridge clearing is a brokerdealer authorized to conduct business in all 50 states under applicable state securities regulations 

changes in our business and the regulatory environment 

in addition we may expand our clearing and outsourcing solutions business into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business the securities and financial services industries are heavily regulated in many foreign countries the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to expand internationally 

privacy and information security regulations 

the processing of personal information is required to provide our services data privacy laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries apply to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information in the us the federal grammleachbliley act which applies to financial institutions and various state privacy laws which apply to businesses that collect personal information apply directly to our subsidiary ridge clearing the grammleachbliley act and state privacy laws apply indirectly through contractual commitments with our clients and through industry standards to the entities that perform our investor communication and securities processing services the state privacy laws require notification to affected individuals state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach of computer databases or physical documents that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information these regulations and laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures 

similar data privacy laws related to the collection transfer use and storage of personal information exist outside of the us such as the european union’s 9546 ec directive of the european parliament canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act individual european national laws and data privacy laws of other countries in some cases these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the grammleachbliley act or the us state privacy laws and may impose additional duties on companies 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

other 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the us and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the 

  

calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

segment and geographic area financial information 

you can find financial information regarding our operating segments and our geographic areas in note 19 “financial data by segment” to our consolidated and combined financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

the separation of broadridge from adp 

until march 30 2007 broadridge was a whollyowned subsidiary of adp the spinoff by adp of its brokerage services business became effective on march 30 2007 through a distribution of 100 of the common stock of the company to the holders of record of adp’s common stock on march 23 2007 the “distribution” in connection with the spinoff adp received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service and an opinion from tax counsel indicating that the spinoff was tax free to the stockholders adp and broadridge please refer to item 1a of part i “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k for information on the tax risks associated with the spinoff from adp 

the financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for the periods ended on or after the distribution are presented on a consolidated and combined basis and include the accounts of broadridge and its majorityowned subsidiaries the financial statements for the periods presented before the distribution are presented on a combined basis and represent those entities that were ultimately transferred to broadridge as part of the spinoff the assets and liabilities presented have been reflected on a historical basis as before the distribution such assets and liabilities were owned by adp however the financial statements for the periods presented before the distribution do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had broadridge been a standalone entity during the periods presented and do not reflect broadridge’s combined results of operations financial position and cash flows had broadridge been a standalone company during the periods presented the results of operations financial position and cash flows for periods before the distribution are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other future period as a result of the presentation described above 

we entered into agreements with adp before the spinoff to govern the terms of the spinoff certain of which will have potential impacts on our business in future periods including 

separation and distribution agreement 

the separation and distribution agreement defines our ongoing relationship with adp following the spinoff and provides for crossindemnities between adp and us principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of adp’s retained businesses with adp 

tax allocation agreement 

the tax allocation agreement governs both our and adp’s rights and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for both pre and postdistribution periods under the tax allocation agreement adp generally is required to indemnify us for any income taxes attributable to its operations or our operations and for any nonincome taxes attributable to its operations in each case for all predistribution periods as well as any taxes 

  

arising from transactions effected to consummate the spinoff and we generally are required to indemnify adp for any nonincome taxes attributable to our operations for all predistribution periods and for any taxes attributable to our operations for postdistribution periods 

we are generally required to indemnify adp against any tax resulting from the distribution and against any claims made against adp in respect of any tax imposed on its stockholders in each case if that tax results from i an issuance of a significant amount of our equity securities a redemption of a significant amount of our equity securities or our involvement in other significant acquisitions of our equity securities excluding the distribution of our stock in the spinoff ii other actions or failures to act by us such as those described in the following paragraph or iii any of our representations or undertakings referred to in the tax allocation agreement being incorrect or violated adp is generally required to indemnify us for any tax resulting from the distribution if that tax results from i adp’s issuance of its equity securities redemption of its equity securities or involvement in other acquisitions of its equity securities ii other actions or failures to act by adp or iii any of adp’s representations or undertakings referred to in the tax allocation agreement being incorrect or violated

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company in each of the noted risk categories i risks relating to our business ii risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business and iii risks relating to our separation from adp however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

future consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry mergers or consolidations of financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or firms that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a large percentage of our revenues is derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal year 2008 we derived approximately 22 of our revenues from five clients our largest single client accounted for between 56 of our revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to client consolidation or nonrenewal of contracts would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations at the end of a contract term clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms particularly with these clients our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various securities exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal state or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our services are provided in a manner to 

  

assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject such as our proxy distribution processing and voting services as a result the services we provide may change as applicable sec and nyse regulations are revised for example the sec has in recent years amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the sec’s notice and access rules have caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services 

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review certain nyse rules regarding the roles and responsibilities of brokerdealers in the proxy process the proxy working group made recommendations in 2007 and certain of its recommendations are pending approval by the sec the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications we continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under evolving legal requirements and industry practices however any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business for example if additional modifications to the current regulations are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the ffiec we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

there has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer privacy the law in these areas is not consistent or settled while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities the legal political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing and subsequent legislation regulation litigation court rulings or other events could expose broadridge to increased program costs liability and possible damage to our reputation 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in trading volume market prices or the liquidity of the securities markets 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our investor communication securities processing and clearing and outsourcing services including the interest income from our margin lending activities and interest earned by investing clients’ cash these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market values of securities can result in 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions activities 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions our clients are subject to laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them in addition our brokerdealer subsidiary ridge clearing is subject to these laws and regulations we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet in addition adp as our data center services provider has information security safeguards in place however despite those safeguards it is possible that hackers employees acting contrary to security policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers any breach of our security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal or account information of our clients’ customers could limit our ability to provide services hinder the growth of our business and subject us to litigation or damage our reputation in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of network or internet security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp and if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

prior to our spinoff from adp we combined our primary data center with adp’s data center in connection with our separation from adp we entered into a multiyear data center outsourcing services agreement with adp pursuant to which adp provides us with data center services consistent with the services provided to us immediately before the spinoff provided that the operation of the data center is the sole responsibility of adp the services include hosting the mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp adp has not ordinarily provided outsourced data center services if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our agreement with adp is terminated for any reason we may not be able to find an alternative data center services provider in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms if we need to build our own information technology infrastructure we may incur substantial costs and could experience temporary business interruptions as a result we may not be able to meet the demands of our clients and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed in addition technology service failures could have adverse regulatory consequences for our clearing and outsourcing solutions business some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in our data center outsourcing services agreement with adp nevertheless we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of the agreement 

  

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of adp as our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause the customers of our clients to suffer delays in their receipt of investor communications or in the execution of their trades these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and could subject us to claims and losses including litigation claiming fraud or negligence that could damage our reputation increase our service costs cause us to lose revenues andor divert our technical resources 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged in connection with our separation from adp we incurred longterm debt with an initial investment grade rating in fiscal year 2007 we issued 250 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due june 2017 the “senior notes” with an investment grade rating during fiscal year 2008 one of the two credit rating agencies that had rated our indebtedness downgraded our credit rating to noninvestment grade we also received an investment grade rating from a third credit rating agency in fiscal year 2008 the downgrade had the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and a further downgrade could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow and further increase our borrowing costs adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations in addition a further downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients for further information with respect to our borrowing costs see note 11 “borrowings” to our financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional 

  

growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis because we utilize the systems of our outsourced data center we will depend on adp to keep the processing capacity and speed of the data center in line with the growth of our business 

in addition with respect to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has increased we have implemented and continue to implement formal compliance procedures to respond to these changes the future operating results of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business will depend on our ability 

 

  

  

 our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global securities industry is characterized by increasingly complex infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes for example an increasing number of our clients are from market segments focusing on hedge funds algorithmic trades and direct access customers who demand increasingly sophisticated products our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the market for our products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services to our market in addition we compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions some of our competitors may possess significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors may also offer a wider range of services than we do and may enjoy greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than ours these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

  

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions businesses the market for such specialists is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we have been and expect to continue to engage in business acquisitions the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

trading volume market prices and liquidity are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets our revenues have historically been largely driven by the volume of trading activities of our clients our margin lending revenues are also impacted by changes in the trading activities of our correspondents accordingly any significant reduction in activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the financial services business is highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenues and profitability for that period of time if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenues operating income net earnings and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition results of operations and cash flows on a fiscal quarterbyquarter basis 

  

risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our existing clearing correspondents may choose to perform their own securities clearing services as their operations grow 

we market our securities clearing services to our existing correspondent clients on the strength of our ability to process transactions and perform related backoffice functions more effectively than these clients could perform these functions themselves as our correspondent clients’ operations grow they often consider the option of performing securities clearing functions themselves in a process referred to in the securities industry as “selfclearing” as the transaction volume of a brokerdealer grows the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for selfclearing may be eventually offset by the elimination of pertransaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm additionally performing their own securities clearing services allows selfclearing brokerdealers to retain their customers’ margin balances free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities if a significant number of clearing correspondents or correspondents representing a significant portion of our business terminate their clearing relationship with us to become selfclearing this could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have tried to address this potential client loss by offering our operations outsourcing service which affords firms an ability to remain or become selfclearing without the necessity of maintaining this infrastructure however some firms may nevertheless choose to change to selfclearing operations and not outsource their operations to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our securities clearing business may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our securities clearing activities involve execution settlement and financing of various securities clearing transactions for a nationwide client base with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our practice of recording securities clearing transactions may expose us to offbalance sheet risk of loss 

we record clients’ securities clearing transactions on a settlement date basis which is generally three business days after the trade date we are therefore exposed to offbalance sheet risk of loss on unsettled transactions in the event clients and other counterparties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our securities clearing business may be subject to liability under our membership agreements with exchanges and clearinghouses 

we are a member of numerous exchanges and clearinghouses under the membership agreements members are generally required to guarantee the performance of other members additionally if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse other members would be required to meet these shortfalls to mitigate these performance risks the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral we may be subject to liability under these arrangements in case of default of a member of those exchanges or clearinghouses 

the involvement of our securities clearing business in options markets subjects us to risks inherent in conducting business in those markets 

we clear options contracts on behalf of our correspondents and their customers trading in options contracts is generally more highly leveraged than trading in other types of securities this additional leverage increases the risk associated with trading in options contracts which in turn raises the risk that a correspondent or customer may not be able to fully repay its creditors including us if it experiences losses in its options trading 

  

our securities clearing and operations outsourcing services could expose us to legal liability for errors in performing clearing or operations outsourcing services and in connection with our clearing services for improper activities of our correspondents 

any intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services or any mishandling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our correspondents and their customers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable authorities as well as actions in contract or tort brought by parties who are financially harmed by those failures or mishandlings any litigation that arises as a result of our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services could harm our reputation and cause us to incur substantial expenses associated with litigation and damage awards that could exceed our liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts 

in the past clearing firms in the us have been held liable for failing to take action upon the receipt of customer complaints failing to know about the suspicious activities of correspondents or their customers under circumstances where they should have known and even aiding and abetting or causing the improper activities of their correspondents we cannot assure you that our procedures regarding our correspondents will be deemed adequate under current laws and regulations or that securities industry regulators will not enact more restrictive laws or regulations or change their interpretations of current laws and regulations if we fail to implement proper procedures or fail to adapt our existing procedures to new or more restrictive regulations we may be subject to liability that could result in substantial costs to us and distract our management from our business 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is subject to complex regulations the violation of which could expose us to interruptions in our business and monetary liability from regulators clients competitors and others 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and costly changes in laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business the costs of the compliance requirements we face and the constraints they impose on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses for a further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate see item 1 of part i “business—regulation” in this annual report on form 10k 

all aspects of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business are subject to extensive regulation which may subject us to disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations 

the securities industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in addition to these laws our clearing and outsourcing services must comply with rules and regulations of the sec finra various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets brokerdealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the establishment and maintenance of an effective compliance system as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations in the future if a claim of noncompliance is made by a regulatory authority the efforts of our management could be diverted to responding to such claim and we could be subject to a range of possible consequences including the payment of fines and the suspension of one or more portions of our business additionally some of our securities clearing services contracts include automatic termination provisions which are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 

in addition because our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required before expansion of our business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 

if our securities clearing business does not maintain the capital levels required by regulations or does not follow the requirements of the customer protection rule we may be subject to fines suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by regulatory authorities 

our securities clearing business is subject to stringent rules imposed by the sec finra and various other regulatory agencies which require brokerdealers to maintain specific levels of net capital and to protect customer funds and customer securities net capital is the net worth of a brokerdealer less deductions for certain assets including assets not readily convertible into cash and specified percentages of certain securities positions if we fail to maintain the required net capital or fail to protect customer funds or customer securities we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra which if not cured could ultimately lead to the liquidation of ridge clearing if the net capital rules are changed or expanded or if there is an unusually large charge against the net capital of ridge clearing we might be required to limit or discontinue our securities clearing and margin lending operations that require the intensive use of capital in addition our ability to withdraw capital from ridge clearing could be restricted which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock if necessary a large operating loss or charge against the net capital of our securities clearing business could impede our ability to expand or even maintain our present volume of business 

procedures and requirements of the usa patriot act may expose our securities clearing business to significant costs or penalties 

as a participant in the financial services industry our securities clearing business is subject to laws and regulations including the usa patriot act of 2001 which require that we know certain information about our securities clearing services clients and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities the cost of complying with the usa patriot act and related laws and regulations is significant we may face particular difficulties in identifying our international clients and gathering the required information about them we face risks that our policies procedures technology and personnel directed toward complying with the usa patriot act are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties due to noncompliance such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

risks relating to our separation from adp 

we have agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the treatment of the distribution as taxfree to adp and its stockholders which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility 

the internal revenue service ruling and opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution relied on certain representations and undertakings from us and the taxfree status of the distribution could be affected if these representations and undertakings are not correct or are violated if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment it will be treated as a taxable dividend to adp stockholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of our stock issued to adp stockholders in that event adp would be required to recognize a gain equal to the excess of the sum of the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date and the amount of cash received in the cash distribution over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

in addition current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to adp but not to its stockholders if we or our stockholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the twoyear period beginning on the distribution date unless it is established that the distribution and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership in the case of such a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership tax imposed on adp in respect of the distribution would be based on the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we are generally prohibited with a number of specified exceptions for specified periods of up to 30 months following the distribution from 

 

  

  

  

  

 we have agreed to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses resulting from certain actions that may cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we agreed generally to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses it suffers as a result of the distribution failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction if the taxes and related losses are attributable to 

 

  

  

 see item 1 of part i “the separation of broadridge from adp—tax allocation agreement” of this annual report on form 10k our indemnity covers both corporate level taxes and related losses imposed on adp in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership described in the preceding risk factor as well as taxes and related losses imposed on both adp and its stockholders if due to our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the distribution is determined to be taxable for other reasons 

  

the indemnification obligation to adp for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could be substantial and it is unlikely that we would have the resources to satisfy it 

our historical financial information for the periods before our separation from adp is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k for the periods before our spinoff from adp does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods before our separation from adp or that we may achieve in the future see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—factors affecting comparability of financial results—historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity”

separation of broadridge from adp 

the spinoff of broadridge by adp became effective on march 30 2007 through a distribution of 100 of the common stock of the company to the holders of record of adp common stock the “distribution” the distribution was effected pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement by which adp contributed to the company the subsidiaries that operated its brokerage services business adp distributed all of the shares of broadridge financial solutions inc as a dividend on adp common stock on march 30 2007 to all stockholders of record as of march 23 2007 

in connection with the spinoff we made a cash payment to adp on march 30 2007 of 6900 million which was financed through borrowings under 11900 million of credit facilities that were entered into on march 29 2007 the payment is reflected as a dividend to adp in stockholders’ equity 

a significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by adp such as investment banking fees related outside legal and accounting fees office move costs costs to separate information systems and temporary consulting costs broadridge incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to the company including stock compensation expense relating to the distribution and other items such as relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to the company and the temporary labor costs incurred to develop ongoing processes for operating on a standalone basis 

factors affecting comparability of financial results 

historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity 

our historical financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operations of the former brokerage services business of adp the combined financial statements for periods before the distribution include allocated costs for facilities functions and services used by the brokerage services business at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the brokerage services business based on usage our management believes these allocation methods are reasonable 

as an independent public company we are responsible for these services and bear all of these expenses directly the historical allocation of adp’s expenses to us may be significantly less than the actual costs we will incur as an independent company for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 and for the period from the date of the distribution to june 30 2007 the company incurred approximately 266 million and 80 million respectively in public company related expenses 

acquisitions and divestitures 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates the results of operations of businesses acquired by the company were included in the company’s consolidated and combined statements of earnings since their respective dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 

the company acquired one business in the securities processing solutions segment in fiscal year 2008 for 61 million this acquisition resulted in approximately 36 million of goodwill intangible assets acquired 

  

which totaled approximately 25 million consist of acquired technology that is being amortized over a fiveyear life this acquisition was not material to the company’s operations financial position or cash flows 

the company acquired one business in the investor communication solutions segment in fiscal year 2006 for 30 million this acquisition resulted in approximately 09 million of goodwill this acquisition was not material to the company’s operations financial position or cash flows in fiscal year 2006 a purchase price adjustment of 154 million was received from the seller based on the resolution of certain provisions of the purchase agreement for the fiscal year 2005 acquisition of the us clearing and dealer services divisions of bank of america corporation the business that became our subsidiary ridge clearing 

borrowings 

on march 29 2007 the company entered into a 11900 million senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a 4400 million fiveyear term loan facility a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 2500 million oneyear revolving credit facility on march 29 2007 the company borrowed 4400 million under the fiveyear term loan facility and 2500 million under the oneyear revolving credit facility the proceeds received in connection with the 6900 million of borrowings were paid to adp on march 30 2007 as a dividend these credit facilities are subject to covenants including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at june 30 2008 and 2007 the company was not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility during the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 the company repaid 1700 million and 700 million respectively of the fiveyear term loan facility the oneyear revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on may 29 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes and cash the senior notes are unsecured obligations of broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of broadridge please refer to note 11 “borrowings” to our financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

basis of presentation 

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company as a separate stand alone entity subsequent to the distribution presented along with the historical operations of the brokerage services business on a combined basis which were operated as part of adp before the distribution these financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated amounts included in retained earnings reflect the company’s net earnings subsequent to the distribution the company’s combined results of operations and cash flows for periods before the distribution may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its results of operations and cash flows would have been had the company operated as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented including changes in its operations and capitalization as a result of the separation from adp in particular interest expense and corporate overhead costs are higher in the periods after the distribution than they were before the distribution in addition the consolidated and combined statements of earnings for the period before the distribution include a trademark royalty fee charged by adp to the company based on revenues for licensing fees associated with the use of the adp trademark after the distribution such royalties are no longer charged to the company 

in presenting the financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

  

the financial statements for periods before the distribution include costs for facilities functions and services used by the company at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the company based on usage the expenses allocated to the company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate independent entity and had otherwise managed these functions following the separation from adp the company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services certain of which were provided by adp during a transitional period pursuant to the transition services agreement see note 17 “transactions with former parent” to the financial statements for a detailed description of the company’s transactions with adp subsequent to the distribution 

critical accounting policies 

we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets ” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weightedaverage cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and longterm debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 4843 million of goodwill as of june 30 2008 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes ” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our financial statements as of june 30 2008 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 279 million of which 47 million expires in years 2009 through 2014 and  232 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition we have estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of a us subsidiary which is not included in our consolidated tax return of approximately 276 million as of june 30 2008 and will expire in 2023 through 2028 we have recorded valuation allowances of 298 million and 219 million at june 30 2008 

  

and 2007 respectively because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating and capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

sharebased payments  sfas no 123r  “sharebased payment” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options before july 1 2005 adp our former parent company followed accounting principles board opinion 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees “apb no 25” and related interpretations under apb no 25 stockbased compensation expense was not recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a 17 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a 10 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a 08 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants which would be amortized over the vesting period

cash flows 

the cash flows from operating and financing activities for our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment differ from that of our other businesses brokerdealer and customer margin activities and transactions require the company to obtain financing from both internal and external sources additionally regulations associated with the brokerdealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers’ balances as a result management analyzes cash flows provided from operating and financing activities of the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment separately from all other businesses 

within operating activities increases in securities clearing receivables and cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes and securities deposited with clearing organizations are a use of cash this can be funded by an increase in securities clearing payables reflected within operating activities or shortterm borrowings reflected within financing activities as a result management analyzes cash flows provided from securities clearing activities separately from all other businesses 

net cash flows provided by used in operating activities were as follows 

 

  

 net cash flows provided by operating activities excluding net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities were 3360 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 468 million compared to 2892 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher collections of trade accounts receivable net of higher payments for income taxes net cash flows provided by operating activities for our securities clearing activities at our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 1460 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to cash flows used in our securities clearing activities of 1287 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 the increase in net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities was primarily due to increased margin balances of 1112 million compared to the increase in margin balances of 2965 million in fiscal year 2007 which required 1853 million less cash outflow in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 the remaining increase in net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities was due to the sale of 327 million of marketable securities in fiscal year 2008 compared to a purchase of 261 million of marketable securities in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a fiscal yearoveryear change of 588 million 

  

net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 were 526 million an increase of 147 million compared to 379 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 the increase reflects higher cash usage for capital expenditures of 96 million and 61 million in cash paid to acquire a new business by our securities processing solutions segment during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008

income taxes 

before the distribution the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the distribution the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company the payment of income taxes by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company is recorded within adp’s net investment on the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity 

the company headquartered in the us is routinely examined by the us internal revenue service the “irs” as part of the irs us federal income tax audit of adp and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the us states and foreign countries in which it conducts business the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction with respect to us federal income taxes the company was a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group through march 30 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidation the company is included in any irs examination of adp for periods up to and including march 30 2007 adp and the company are currently under irs audit for the fiscal year ended june 30 1998 through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 which is expected to be substantially completed in fiscal year 2009 in addition the irs is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and adp the us federal income tax payable of the company for the period ended march 30 2007 will be assumed by adp in addition any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the irs attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier will be tax liabilities assumed by adp correspondingly any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2008 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

  

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the combined financial condition of the company or on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period 

defined benefit pension plans

our products and services 

our operations are classified into three business segments investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions 

investor communication solutions 

a majority of publicly traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners instead a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name” meaning that they are held of record by brokers or banks through their depositories most street name shares are registered in the name “cede  co” the name used by the depository trust and clearing corporation “dtcc” which holds shares on behalf of its participant brokers and banks these participant brokers and banks which are known as nominees because they hold securities in name only in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients the individual beneficial owners nominees upon request are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names addresses and share holdings supplied to companies so called “nonobjecting beneficial owners” or “nobos” objecting beneficial owners or “obos” may be contacted directly only by the broker or bank or its agent 

because dtcc’s role is only that of custodian a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner such as the right to vote to the beneficial owners the first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy” which dtcc executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant nominees 

under applicable rules nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions nominees are often prohibited by applicable new york stock exchange “nyse” or other selfregulatory organization “sro” rules or by express agreements with their customers from voting the securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions 

a large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy which authority they receive from dtcc via omnibus proxy we then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms known as “vifs” to beneficial owners 

sec rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name the reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of sros including the nyse we act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with respect to this reimbursement we bill public companies on behalf of the nominees collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us for our services 

we also compile nobo lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers the preparation of nobo lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the brokers the reimbursement rates are based on the number of nobos on the list produced pursuant to nyse or other sro rules such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such nobo lists we function as such an intermediary in the nobo process

employees 

at june 30 2007 we had approximately 4241 employees none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company we believe that our employee relations are good 

regulation 

the securities and financial services industries generally are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and elsewhere as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the united states and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets not with protecting the interests of creditors or the stockholders of regulated entities 

in the united states the securities and financial services industry is subject to regulation under both federal and state laws at the federal level the sec regulates the securities industry along with the financial industry regulatory authority or finra the entity formed from the july 2007 consolidation of the nasd and nyse regulation enforcement and arbitration functions the various stock exchanges and other selfregulatory organizations “sros” companies that operate in these industries are subject to regulation concerning many aspects of their business including trade practices capital structure record retention money laundering prevention and the supervision of the conduct of directors officers and employees failure to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations could result in censure fine the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or revocation of sec authorization granted to allow the operation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business or disqualification of the directors officers or employees of such business 

a large portion of our investor communication solutions business involves proxy distribution processing and voting services on december 13 2006 the sec adopted amendments to its proxy rules that allow public companies an option to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the “voluntary rule” the voluntary rule went into effect on july 1 2007 

  

under the voluntary rule public companies may furnish proxy materials to stockholders by posting them on an internet website and providing stockholders with notice of the internet availability of the proxy materials the notice will be mailed to stockholders unless they have previously elected to receive proxy materials via electronic delivery stockholders will have two choices neither of which will result in a charge to the stockholder they may either request that paper copies of the proxy materials be mailed to them for a specific meeting or they may make a permanent election to receive proxy materials by mail or by email with respect to future proxy solicitations for all securities held in their account when a public company chooses to rely on the notice and access model brokers banks and similar financial intermediaries “intermediaries” must prepare and send their own notices to their customers who are beneficial stockholders a beneficial stockholder desiring a paper or email copy of the proxy materials must request one from the intermediary 

on july 26 2007 the sec adopted further rule amendments that require public companies and soliciting persons to furnish proxy materials to stockholders by posting them on an internet website other than the sec’s edgar website the “universal rule” otherwise the process as set forth in the voluntary rule including providing stockholders with notice of the internet availability of the proxy materials remains unchanged the largest public companies will be required to comply with the universal rule for solicitations beginning on or after january 1 2008 all other issuers and soliciting persons will have to comply for solicitations beginning on or after january 1 2009 

the adopted changes will result in our having to perform additional processing in connection with the provision of the proxy services we believe that the volume of items to be mailed will remain unchanged however the weight of the packages will be less resulting in lower distribution revenues while we anticipate deriving additional revenue from a variety of services we will provide on behalf of intermediaries in order for them to comply with the new rules as well as optional services we will provide to public companies such as website hosting document conversion and warehousing of paper proxy materials we do not expect that our revenues from these services will completely offset the anticipated decrease in distribution revenues however we do not expect that the rule changes will result in a material change to our net earnings derived from the proxy services 

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review the nyse’s rules regarding the participation of its brokerage firm members in the proxy voting process a report issued by the proxy working group in june 2006 recommended that the nyse amend existing rules that allow brokers in certain circumstances to vote in uncontested director elections the proxy working group has made other recommendations including that the nyse review our role in the proxy process 

the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business moreover if additional modifications to the current regulatory regime are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

our investor communication solutions and securities processing solutions businesses are not directly subject to regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions however our clients the regulated financial institutions require that we abide by us and international privacy and information security standards imposed on them in processing their customers’ personal information 

also certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec which are the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision and the national credit union association the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or 

  

potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services 

our businesses both directly and indirectly rely on the internet and other electronic communications gateways we intend to expand our use of these gateways to date the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints however governmental agencies within the united states and elsewhere are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet accordingly new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is conducted through our subsidiary ridge a brokerdealer registered with the sec and a member of finra and various other sros our clearing and outsourcing solutions business operates in the regulatory environment discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section 

as a registered brokerdealer our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is required to participate in the securities investor protection corporation “sipc” in the event of a brokerdealer member’s insolvency sipc provides protection of up to 500000 per customer with a limitation of 100000 on claims for cash balances additional protection “excess sipc” is provided through customer asset protection company a vermontlicensed insurer excess sipc increases account protection up to net equity of the customer account but does not protect against losses from the rise and fall in the market value of investments and does not cover all assets such coverages are provided in connection with our securities clearing services and are for the benefit of all customers of our introducing brokerdealer clients 

regulation of clearing activities 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business provides clearing services to correspondents in the united states with whom we are not affiliated errors in performing clearing functions including clerical technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients and brokerdealers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our clients including our correspondents the customers of our correspondents and others 

regulatory capital requirements 

as a registered brokerdealer and member of finra our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is subject to the sec’s net capital rule the net capital rule which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered brokerdealers is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a brokerdealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form among deductions from net capital are adjustments which are commonly called “haircuts” which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of firm inventory prior to disposition the effects of securities lending and securities borrowing activities on net capital calculations are described below 

failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ridge to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of ridge the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends redemption of stock the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder employee or affiliate if such payment would reduce ridge’s net capital below required levels 

the net capital rule also provides that the sec may restrict any capital withdrawal including the withdrawal of equity capital or unsecured loans or advances to stockholders employees or affiliates if such capital withdrawal together with all other net capital withdrawals during a 30day period exceeds 30 of excess net 

  

capital and the sec concludes that the capital withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the brokerdealer in addition the net capital rule provides that the total outstanding principal amount of a brokerdealer’s indebtedness under specified subordination agreements the proceeds of which are included in its net capital may not exceed 70 of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all subordinated indebtedness included in net capital par or stated value of capital stock paid in capital in excess of par retained earnings and other capital accounts for a period in excess of 90 days 

a change in the net capital rule the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit some of our securities clearing and operations outsourcing activities that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our clearing and outsourcing solutions business which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

regulation of securities lending and borrowing 

as part of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business we engage in securities lending and borrowing services with other brokerdealers either by lending the securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other brokerdealers or by borrowing securities from one brokerdealer and lending the same securities to another brokerdealer within the united states these types of securities lending and borrowing arrangements are governed by the following sec rules 

the securities lending and borrowing activities transacted through our clearing and outsourcing solutions business are subject to the sec’s net capital rule described above because engaging in securities lending and borrowing presents counterparty credit risk to the brokerdealer the provisions in the net capital rule requiring unsecured receivables to be deducted from the brokerdealer’s net worth in order to compute its “net capital” reduce the impact of such counterparty credit risk to the brokerdealer’s financial integrity in addition because brokerdealers normally receive cash collateral in excess of the market value of the securities loaned the net capital rule requires a 100 deduction to the extent that the market value of the securities loaned exceeds cash collateral received on the other hand no deduction is required where a brokerdealer provides excess collateral to a lender provided the amount of the excess collateral does not exceed certain parameters the securities lending and borrowing activities are also subject to the sec’s customer protection rule the projective of which is to ensure that investment property of the firm’s customers will be available to be distributed in the event of a liquidation of a registered brokerdealer the customer protection rule operates to protect both customer funds and customer securities to protect customer securities the customer protection rule requires that the brokerdealers promptly obtain possession or control of customers’ fully paid securities free of any lien however brokerdealers may lend or borrow customers’ securities purchased on margin or customers’ fully paid securities if the brokerdealer provides collateral exceeding the market value of the securities it borrowed and makes certain other disclosures to the customer with respect to customer funds the customer protection rule requires brokerdealers to make deposits into an account held only for the benefit of customers “reserve account” based on its computation of the reserve formula the reserve formula requires that brokerdealers compare the amount of funds it has received from customers or through the use of their securities “credits” to the amount of funds the firm has used to finance customer activities “debits” in this manner the customer protection rule ensures that the brokerdealer’s securities lending and borrowing activities do not impact the amount of funds available to customers in the event of liquidation 

sec rules 8c1 and 15c21 under the exchange act the “hypothecation rules” set forth requirements relating to the borrowing or lending of our correspondents’ customers’ securities the hypothecation rules prohibit us from borrowing or lending correspondents’ customers securities in situations where 1 the securities of one customer will be held together with securities of another customer without first obtaining the written consent of each customer 2 the securities of a customer will be held together with securities owned by a person or entity that is not a customer or 3 the securities of a customer will be subject to a lien for an amount in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all customers’ securities 

regulation t was issued by the board of governors of the us federal reserve “federal reserve” pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 in part to regulate the borrowing and lending of securities by 

  

brokersdealers although regulation t allows brokerdealers to deposit cash in order to secure the borrowing of securities for the purpose of making deliveries of such securities in the case of short sales failure to receive securities they are required to deliver or other similar cases and lend securities for such purpose against such a deposit it also includes provisions regarding the provision of collateral for example under the provisions of regulation t brokerdealers are generally required to collect cash equal to 50 of the value of equity securities purchased in a margin account however we may require the deposit of a higher percentage of the value of equity securities purchased on margin securities borrowed transactions are extensions of credit in that the securities lender generally receives cash collateral effectively cash borrowed that exceeds the market value of the securities that were lent as that amount exceeds the 50 limitation imposed by regulation t on margin lending regulation t limits the circumstances under which brokerdealers can borrow securities 

with respect to such securities borrowing and lending regulation sho issued under the exchange act generally prohibits among other things a brokerdealer from accepting a short sale order unless either the brokerdealer has borrowed the security or entered into a bonafide arrangement to borrow the security or has “reasonable grounds” to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with this requirement 

failure to maintain the required net capital accurately compute the reserve formula or comply with regulation t or regulation sho may subject ridge to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra and other regulatory bodies and if not cured could ultimately require the liquidation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business a change in the net capital rule the hypothecation rules the customer protection rule or regulation t or the imposition of new rules could adversely impact our ability to engage in securities lending and borrowing which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt or repurchase shares of outstanding stock 

margin risk management 

our margin lending activities expose the capital of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business to significant risks these risks include but are not limited to absolute and relative price movements price volatility or changes in liquidity over which we have virtually no control 

we attempt to minimize the risks inherent in our margin lending activities by retaining in our margin lending agreements the ability to adjust margin requirements as needed and by exercising a high degree of selectivity when accepting new correspondents when determining whether to accept a new correspondent we evaluate among other factors the brokerage firm’s experience in the industry its financial condition and the background of the principals of the firm in addition we have multiple layers of protection including the balances in customers’ accounts correspondents’ commissions on deposit clearing deposits and equity in correspondent firms in the event that a correspondent or one of its customers does not deliver payment for our services we also maintain a bad debt reserve our customer agreements and fullydisclosed clearing agreements require industry arbitration in the event of a dispute arbitration is generally less expensive and more time efficient than dispute resolution through the court system although we attempt to minimize the risk associated with our margin lending activities there is no assurance that the assumptions on which we base our decisions will be correct or that we are in a position to predict factors or events which will have an adverse impact on any individual client or issuer or the securities markets in general 

state regulation 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is a brokerdealer authorized to conduct business in all 50 states under applicable state securities regulations 

changes in our business and the regulatory environment 

in addition we may expand our clearing and outsourcing solutions business into other countries in the future we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business the securities and financial services industry is heavily regulated in many foreign countries the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to expand internationally 

  

seasonality 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k or incorporated by reference herein based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company in each of the noted risk categories i risks relating to our business ii risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business and iii risks relating to our recent separation from adp however additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

risks relating to our business 

future consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry mergers or consolidations of financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example one of our large clients has recently been acquired and has elected to utilize the proprietary services of the acquiring firm as anticipated during our fourth quarter this client terminated services provided through our securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions businesses however we will continue to provide this client and its acquiror which was an existing client with proxy distribution and related services the client generated 376 million and 397 million of revenue in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2006 respectively with respect to the services being terminated the proxy distribution and related services that we will continue to provide to this client and the acquiror generated 345 million and 326 million of revenue in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2006 respectively 

a large percentage of our revenues is derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry 

in fiscal 2007 we derived approximately 24 of our revenues from five clients our largest single client accounted for between 56 of our revenues while these clients generally work with multiple business segments the loss of business from any of these clients due to client consolidation or nonrenewal of contracts would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations moreover we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew any of our contracts on terms we consider favorable a client of our investor communication solutions business segment that was one of our four largest clients in fiscal year 2007 terminated its contract for account statement processing and distribution services in february 2007 however we will continue to provide this client with proxy distribution and related services this client generated 283 million and 448 million of revenue in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2006 respectively with respect to the services being terminated the proxy distribution and related services that we will continue to provide to this client generated 627 million and 452 million of revenue in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively 

the financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability 

the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo further change in the future the sec finra various securities exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business 

a large portion of our investor communication solutions involves proxy distribution processing and voting services on december 13 2006 the sec adopted amendments to its proxy rules that allow public companies an option to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery the “voluntary rule” the voluntary rule went into effect on july 1 2007 on july 26 2007 the sec adopted further rule amendments that require public companies and soliciting persons to furnish proxy materials to stockholders by posting them on an internet website other than the sec’s edgar website the “universal rule” please refer to item 1 of part i “business — regulation” of this annual report on form 10k for further information on these developments 

  

the adopted changes will result in our having to perform additional processing in connection with the provision of the proxy services we believe that the volume of items to be mailed will remain unchanged however the weight of the packages will be less resulting in lower distribution revenues while we anticipate deriving additional revenue from a variety of services we will provide on behalf of intermediaries in order for them to comply with the new rules as well as optional services we will provide to public companies such as website hosting document conversion and warehousing of paper proxy materials we do not expect that our revenues from these services will completely offset the anticipated decrease in distribution revenues however we do not expect that the rule changes will result in a material change to our net earnings derived from the proxy services 

in addition in 2005 the nyse convened a proxy working group to review the nyse’s rules regarding the participation of its brokerage firm members in the proxy voting process a report issued by the proxy working group in june 2006 recommended that the nyse amend existing rules that allow brokers in certain circumstances to vote in uncontested director elections the proxy working group has made other recommendations including that the nyse review our role in the proxy process 

the proxy working group recommendations and any additional proposals by the sec to change the proxy rules could result in further changes to the regulations and practices regarding the distribution of proxy materials proxy voting and stockholder communications any such changes may result in a negative effect on our investor communication solutions business moreover if additional modifications to the current regulatory regime are enacted that allow for internet delivery of additional types of investor communications without requiring that a notice be sent to stockholders our revenues and results of operations in the investor communication solutions business could be adversely affected 

also certain of the securities processing services we provide may be deemed to be missioncritical functions of financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” we are therefore subject to examination by the member agencies of the ffiec the ffiec conducts periodic reviews of certain of our operations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to which we provide services evaluates our risk management systems and controls and determines our compliance with applicable laws that affect the services we provide to financial institutions in addition to examining areas such as our management of technology data integrity information confidentiality and service availability the reviews also assess our financial stability a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our revenues may decrease due to declines in trading volume market prices liquidity of securities markets or proprietary trading activity 

we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our investor communication securities processing and clearing and outsourcing services including the interest income from our margin lending activities and interest earned by investing clients’ cash these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes market prices and liquidity of securities markets over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market values of securities can result in 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions activities 

breaches of our information security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider could adversely affect our ability to operate could result in the personal or account information of our clients’ customers being misappropriated and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 

we process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions our clients are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed and they require that we abide by such laws and regulations in performing our services for them we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards including encryption authentication technology and transmission of data over private networks in order to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet in addition adp as our data center services provider has information security safeguards in place however despite those safeguards it is possible that hackers employees acting contrary to security policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the personal or account information of our clients’ customers any breach of our security policies or safeguards or those of our outsourced data center services provider resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal or account information of our clients’ customers could limit our ability to provide services hinder the growth of our business and subject us to litigation or damage our reputation in addition we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of network or internet security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 

we have combined our primary data center with adp’s data center from whom we purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities and if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

in july 2006 we combined our primary data center with adp’s data center in connection with our separation from adp we entered into a multiyear data center outsourcing services agreement with adp pursuant to which adp provides us with data center services consistent with the services provided to us immediately prior to the spinoff provided that the operation of the data center is the sole responsibility of adp the services include hosting the mainframe midrange open systems and networks additionally systems engineering network engineering hardware engineering network operations data center operations application change management and data center disaster recovery services are managed by adp as a result we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services including disaster recovery capabilities from adp adp has not ordinarily provided outsourced data center services if adp fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our agreement with adp is terminated for any reason we may not be able to find an alternative data center services provider in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms if we need to build our 

  

own information technology infrastructure we may incur substantial costs and could experience temporary business interruptions as a result we may not be able to meet the demands of our clients and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed in addition technology service failures could have adverse regulatory consequences for our clearing and outsourcing solutions business some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits termination rights and indemnification clauses in our data center outsourcing services agreement with adp nevertheless we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of the agreement 

any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced data center services provider could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 

our services depend on our ability to store retrieve process and manage significant databases and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media our systems those of our outsourced data center services provider or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of adp as our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation moreover because we have outsourced our data center operations the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems communications systems or any other systems in the clearing or trading processes could cause the customers of our clients to suffer delays in the execution of their trades these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and could subject us to claims and losses including litigation claiming fraud or negligence that could damage our reputation increase our service costs cause us to lose revenues andor divert our technical resources 

if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 

the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis because we utilize the systems of our outsourced data center we will depend on adp to keep the processing capacity and speed of the data center in line with the growth of our business 

in addition with respect to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has increased we have implemented and continue to implement formal compliance procedures to respond to these changes the future operating results of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business will depend on our ability 

 

   

  

 our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems financial systems and controls and office facilities in the absence of continued revenue growth the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully if we fail to manage our growth we may experience operating inefficiencies dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 

if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 

the global securities industry is characterized by increasingly complex infrastructures and products new and changing business models and rapid technological changes our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes for example an increasing number of our clients are from market segments focusing on hedge funds algorithmic trades and direct access customers who demand increasingly sophisticated products our future success will depend in part on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services capabilities and technologies on a timely and costeffective basis to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards and to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements 

intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 

the market for our products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services to our market in addition we compete with our clients’ inhouse capabilities to perform competitive functions some of our competitors may possess significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors may also offer a wider range of services than we do and may enjoy greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than ours these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors if we fail to compete effectively our market share could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions businesses the market for such specialists is extremely competitive and has grown more so recently due to industry growth there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

our products and services and the products and services provided to us by third parties may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 

although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights if we infringe upon the rights of third parties we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms additionally 

  

third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations which could prevent them from continuing to provide these products and services to us in either of these events we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so in addition any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract our management from our business furthermore a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 

from time to time we have been and expect to continue to be a business acquiror the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks the core risks are in the areas of 

 

  

  

 also the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources these risks may arise for a number of reasons including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

   

general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 

trading volume market prices and liquidity are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets our revenue has historically been largely driven by the volume of trading activities of our clients our margin lending revenues are also impacted by changes in the trading activities of our correspondents accordingly any significant reduction in activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 

the financial services business is highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 

our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades terrorist activities in september 2001 caused the us securities markets to close for four days this impacted our revenue and profitability for that period of time if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity our revenues and profits may be impacted negatively again 

our revenue is subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis 

risks relating to our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our existing clearing correspondents may choose to perform their own securities clearing services as their operations grow 

we market our securities clearing services to our existing correspondent clients on the strength of our ability to process transactions and perform related backoffice functions more effectively than these clients could 

  

perform these functions themselves as our correspondent clients’ operations grow they often consider the option of performing securities clearing functions themselves in a process referred to in the securities industry as “selfclearing” as the transaction volume of a brokerdealer grows the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for selfclearing may be eventually offset by the elimination of pertransaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm additionally performing their own securities clearing services allows selfclearing brokerdealers to retain their customers’ margin balances free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities if a significant number of clearing correspondents or correspondents representing a significant portion of our business terminate their clearing relationship with us to become selfclearing this could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have tried to address this potential client loss by offering our operations outsourcing service which affords firms an ability to remain or become selfclearing without the necessity of maintaining this infrastructure however some firms may nevertheless choose to change to selfclearing operations and not outsource their operations to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our securities clearing business may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties 

in the normal course of business our securities clearing activities involve execution settlement and financing of various security clearing transactions for a nationwide client base with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our practice of recording security clearing transactions may expose us to offbalance sheet risk of loss 

we record clients’ security clearing transactions on a settlement date basis which is generally three business days after trade date we are therefore exposed to offbalance sheet risk of loss on unsettled transactions in the event clients and other counterparties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

our securities clearing business may be subject to liability under our membership agreements with exchanges and clearinghouses 

we are a member of numerous exchanges and clearinghouses under the membership agreements members are generally required to guarantee the performance of other members additionally if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse other members would be required to meet these shortfalls to mitigate these performance risks the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral we may be subject to liability under these arrangements in case of default of a member of those exchanges or clearinghouses 

our securities clearing business’ involvement in options markets subjects us to risks inherent in conducting business in those markets 

we clear options contracts on behalf of our correspondents and their customers trading in options contracts is generally more highly leveraged than trading in other types of securities this additional leverage increases the risk associated with trading in options contracts which in turn raises the risk that a correspondent or customer may not be able to fully repay its creditors including us if it experiences losses in its options contract trading business 

our securities clearing and operations outsourcing services could expose us to legal liability for errors in performing clearing or operations outsourcing services and in connection with our clearing services for improper activities of our correspondents 

any intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services or any mishandling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our correspondents and their customers could lead to censures fines or other sanctions by applicable authorities as well as actions in contract or 

  

tort brought by parties who are financially harmed by those failures or mishandlings any litigation that arises as a result of our securities clearing or operations outsourcing services could harm our reputation and cause us to incur substantial expenses associated with litigation and damage awards that could exceed our liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts 

in the past clearing firms in the united states have been held liable for failing to take action upon the receipt of customer complaints failing to know about the suspicious activities of correspondents or their customers under circumstances where they should have known and even aiding and abetting or causing the improper activities of their correspondents we cannot assure you that our procedures will be sufficient to properly monitor our correspondents under current laws and regulations or that securities industry regulators will not enact more restrictive laws or regulations or change their interpretations of current laws and regulations if we fail to implement proper procedures or fail to adapt our existing procedures to new or more restrictive regulations we may be subject to liability that could result in substantial costs to us and distract our management from our business 

our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is subject to complex regulations the violation of which could expose us to interruptions in our business and monetary liability from regulations clients competitors and others 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnelintensive changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business the costs of the compliance requirements we face and the constraints they impose on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses for a further discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate see item 1 of part i “business — regulation” in this annual report on form 10k 

all aspects of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business are subject to extensive government regulation which may subject us to disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations 

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in addition to these laws our clearing and outsourcing services must comply with rules and regulations of the sec finra various stock exchanges state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets brokerdealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of an effective compliance system as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations in the future and even for the claimed noncompliance of our correspondents with such regulations if a claim of noncompliance is made by a regulatory authority the efforts of our management could be diverted to responding to such claim and we could be subject to a range of possible consequences including the payment of fines and the suspension of one or more portions of our business additionally some of our securities clearing services contracts include automatic termination provisions which are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 

in addition because our clearing and outsourcing solutions business is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required prior to expansion of our business activities we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 

if our securities clearing business does not maintain the capital levels required by regulations we may be subject to fines suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by regulatory authorities 

our securities clearing business is subject to stringent rules imposed by the sec finra and various other regulatory agencies which require brokerdealers to maintain specific levels of net capital net capital is the net worth of a brokerdealer less deductions for other types of assets including assets not readily convertible into cash and specified percentages of a brokerdealer’s securities positions if we fail to maintain the required net capital we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by finra which if not cured could ultimately lead to the liquidation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business if the net capital rules are changed or expanded or if there is an unusually large charge against the net capital of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business we might be required to limit or discontinue our securities clearing and margin lending operations that require the intensive use of capital in addition our ability to withdraw capital from our clearing and outsourcing solutions business could be restricted which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends repay debt at the parent company level and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock if necessary a large operating loss or charge against the net capital of our securities clearing business could impede our ability to expand or even maintain our present volume of business 

procedures and requirements of the usa patriot act may expose our securities clearing business to significant costs or penalties 

as participants in the financial services industry our securities clearing business is subject to laws and regulations including the usa patriot act of 2001 which require that we know certain information about our securities clearing services clients and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities the cost of complying with the usa patriot act and related laws and regulations is significant we may face particular difficulties in identifying our international clients gathering the required information about them and monitoring their activities we face risks that our policies procedures technology and personnel directed toward complying with the usa patriot act are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties due to noncompliance such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

risks relating to our recent separation from adp 

our historical financial information prior to our recent separation from adp is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods prior to our recent separation from adp or that we may achieve in the future this is primarily a result of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

 for a description of the components of our historical consolidated and combined financial information see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—factors affecting comparability of financial results—historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity” 

we have experienced and will continue to experience increased costs as a result of the separation 

we have had to replicate certain facilities systems infrastructure and personnel to which we no longer have access after our separation from adp we also have had to make investments to operate without access to adp’s operational and administrative infrastructure these initiatives are costly to implement due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects the amount of total costs cannot be estimated at this time 

adp performed many important corporate functions for our operations including information technology support treasury accounting financial reporting tax administration human resource administration procurement and other services following the separation adp has continued to provide some of these services to us on a shortterm transitional basis for which we pay adp fees generally based on the applicable allocable cost of adp’s services to the brokerage services business prior to the distribution for more information regarding the transition arrangements see item 1 of part i “business—our relationship with adp—transition services agreement” as we begin to operate these functions independently if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or are unable to obtain them from other providers we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs and our profitability may decline 

prior to the separation our business benefited from adp’s purchasing power when procuring goods and services including office supplies and equipment travel services telecommunications computer software licenses insurance and benefits as a standalone company we may be unable to obtain goods and services at comparable prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the separation which could decrease our overall profitability 

  

as part of the separation from adp we have incurred debt with external lenders which subject us to various restrictions and could decrease our profitability 

shortly prior to the separation we incurred 6900 million in debt to fund a dividend to adp pursuant to new senior unsecured credit facilities consisting of a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility which provide for aggregate maximum borrowings of 9400 million and an interim revolving credit facility which provides for aggregate maximum borrowings of 2500 million prior to the separation we borrowed 4400 million under the term loan facility and 2500 million under the interim revolving credit facility and used the proceeds to pay the dividend to adp in may 2007 we repaid the 2500 million oneyear revolving credit facility with the proceeds of an offering of 2500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of 6125 per annum the “senior notes” and cash the oneyear revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment as of june 30 2007 there is 3700 million of indebtedness outstanding under the term loan facility we anticipate making additional borrowings under these credit facilities and using the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

the credit facilities and senior notes described above contain customary restrictions covenants and events of default the terms of these financing arrangements and any future indebtedness impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities in addition our financing costs are higher than they were when we were a part of adp for more detailed discussions of these borrowings and our liquidity see item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—financial condition liquidity and capital resources” and note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated and combined financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we may not have sufficient capital generation ability to meet our operating and regulatory capital requirements 

as a standalone company we may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than those maintained by adp to retain our credit ratings in addition we will need to cover volatility associated with variations in our operating riskbased and regulatory capital requirements including separation costs and contingent exposures such as our indemnification obligation to adp in connection with the tax allocation agreement we entered into with adp see item 1 of part i “business—regulation” of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the capital requirements of our clearing and outsourcing solutions business 

our business financial position and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 

in connection with our separation from adp we incurred longterm debt with an initial investment grade rating and have also issued the senior notes with an investment grade rating if our initial rating is downgraded or if ratings agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged this could adversely affect our relationships with our clients also a downgrade could increase our costs of borrowing money adversely affecting our business financial position and results of operations 

we have agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the treatment of the distribution as taxfree to adp and its stockholders which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility 

the internal revenue service ruling and opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution relied on certain representations and undertakings from us and the taxfree status of the distribution could be affected if these representations and undertakings are not correct or are violated if the distribution fails to qualify for taxfree treatment it will be treated as a taxable dividend to adp stockholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of our stock issued to adp stockholders in that event adp would be required to recognize a gain equal to the excess of the sum of the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date and the amount of cash received in the cash distribution over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

  

in addition current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to adp but not to its stockholders if we or our stockholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the twoyear period beginning on the distribution date unless it is established that the distribution and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership in the case of such a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership tax imposed on adp in respect of the distribution would be based on the fair market value of our stock on the distribution date over adp’s tax basis in our stock 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we are generally prohibited except in specified circumstances for specified periods of up to 30 months following the distribution from 

 

  

  

  

  

 we have agreed to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses resulting from certain actions that may cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction 

under the tax allocation agreement that we entered into with adp we agreed generally to indemnify adp for taxes and related losses it suffers as a result of the distribution failing to qualify as a taxfree transaction if the taxes and related losses are attributable to 

 

  

  

 see item 1 of part i “our relationship with adp—tax allocation agreement” of this annual report on form 10k our indemnity covers both corporate level taxes and related losses imposed on adp in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership described in the preceding risk factor as well as taxes and related losses imposed on both adp and its stockholders if due to our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated the distribution is determined to be taxable for other reasons 

the indemnification obligation to adp for taxes due in the event of a 50 or greater change in our stock ownership could be substantial and it is unlikely that we would have the resources to satisfy it 

the cost of compliance or failure to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 may adversely affect our business 

as a new reporting company under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act we are subject to the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which may result in higher compliance costs and may adversely affect our financial results and our ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers the sarbanesoxley act affects corporate governance securities disclosure compliance practices internal audits disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and 

  

accounting systems section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for example requires a company subject to the reporting requirements of the us securities laws to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal controls over financial reporting the failure to comply with section 404 may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact our business our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as a public company and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences 

our separation from adp could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients and recruit and retain employees 

as a division of adp we previously marketed our products and services using the “adp” brand name and logo we believe the association with adp provided us with preferred status among our clients and employees due to adp’s 

 

  

  

 in connection with the separation and distribution we changed our corporate name and now operate under a new brand name without the adp brand name we may not be able to maintain or enjoy comparable name recognition or status under our new brand our separation from adp may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients which could result in the termination of our investor communication securities processing and clearing and outsourcing client relationships 

the adp brand and our affiliation with adp have also been key aspects of our recruitment and retention of our employees our separation from adp could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain senior management and other key employees 

if we are unable to successfully manage the transition of our business to our new brand our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected we cannot predict the effect that our separation from adp will have on our clients and our employees 

the continued ownership of adp common stock by our executive officers and some of our directors may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest 

because of their current or former positions with adp substantially all of our executive officers including our executive chairman chief executive officer and our president and chief operating officer and some of our nonemployee directors own adp common stock these holdings in adp common stock may be significant for some of these persons compared to that person’s total assets even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent from both adp and our company and our executive officers who were employees of adp ceased to be employees of adp upon consummation of the distribution ownership of adp common stock by our directors and officers after the separation may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for adp than they do for us

as a holding company with no material liquid assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries our ability to pay dividends will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries ridge our subsidiary through which we provide our securities clearing and operations outsourcing services is highly regulated and may be subject to restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to us

in connection with the spinoff we made a cash payment to adp on march 30 2007 of 6900 million which was financed through borrowings under 11900 million of credit facilities that were entered into on march 29 2007 the payment is reflected as a dividend to adp in stockholders’ equity 

a significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by adp such as investment banking fees related outside legal and accounting fees office move costs costs to separate information systems and temporary consulting costs broadridge incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to the company including stock compensation expense relating to the distribution and other items such as relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to the company and the temporary labor costs incurred to develop ongoing processes for operating on a standalone basis 

factors affecting comparability of financial results 

historical adp cost allocations compared to broadridge as a standalone entity 

our historical consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operations of the former brokerage services business of adp the combined financial statements for periods prior to the distribution include allocated costs for facilities functions and services used by the brokerage services business at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the brokerage services business based on usage our management believes these allocation methods are reasonable however it is likely that as a standalone entity our costs for the same services will be higher for the following reasons 

size and influence of adp  we generally benefited from the size of adp in negotiating many of our overhead costs and were able to leverage the adp business as a whole including the employer services business from which adp derives a majority of its total revenues in obtaining favorable pricing adp is a larger company than we are with extensive resources as a standalone company we no longer have this advantage 

shared corporate overhead  as the brokerage services business of adp our ultimate management was the management of adp moreover adp performed all of the public company obligations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 as an independent public company we will be responsible for these services and bear all of these expenses directly the historical allocation of adp’s expenses to us may be significantly less than the actual costs we will incur as an independent company for the period from the date of distribution to june 30 2007 the company incurred approximately 80 million in public company related expenses 

acquisitions and divestitures 

from time to time we make acquisitions and divestitures for strategic reasons in fiscal year 2005 we acquired the us clearing and brokerdealer services businesses of bank of america corporation for approximately 3442 million net of cash acquired this acquisition resulted in the creation of our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment which enables us to provide trade execution clearing and settlement services asset management customer financing services including margin lending securities borrowing to facilitate customer short selling activity and operations outsourcing services for a variety of clearing and custodyrelated functions 

borrowings 

on march 29 2007 the company entered into a 11900 million senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a 4400 million fiveyear term loan facility a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 2500 million oneyear revolving credit facility on march 29 2007 the company borrowed 4400 million under the fiveyear term loan facility and 2500 million under the oneyear revolving credit facility the proceeds received in connection with the 6900 million of borrowings were paid to adp on march 30 2007 as a dividend these credit facilities are subject to covenants including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at june 30 2007 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility on june 29 2007 the company repaid 700 million of the fiveyear term loan facility the oneyear revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on may 29 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes due june 2017 and cash the senior notes are unsecured obligations of broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of broadridge please refer to note 12 “borrowings” to our consolidated and combined financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion 

basis of presentation 

the consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operation of the company as a separate standalone entity subsequent to the distribution presented along with the historical operations of the brokerage services business on a combined basis which were operated as part of adp prior to the distribution these financial statements include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting the company’s combined results of operations financial position and cash flows for periods prior to the distribution may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its results of operations financial position and cash flows would have been had the company operated as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented including changes in its operations and capitalization as a result of the separation from adp in particular interest expense and corporate overhead costs will be higher than they were in the past in addition the consolidated and combined statements of earnings include a trademark royalty fee charged by adp to the company based on revenues for licensing fees associated with the use of the adp trademark as of march 30 2007 such royalties are no longer charged to the company 

in presenting the consolidated and combined financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates in management’s opinion the consolidated and combined financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods 

  

the consolidated and combined financial statements for periods prior to the distribution include costs for facilities functions and services used by the company at shared adp sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to the company based on usage following the separation from adp the company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services certain of which are provided by adp during a transitional period pursuant to the transition services agreement see note 18 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a detailed description of the company’s transactions with adp subsequent to the distribution the expenses allocated to the company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate independent entity and had otherwise managed these functions 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets ” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weighted average cost of capital the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions the weighted average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods we had 4802 million of goodwill as of june 30 2007 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings a 10 change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes ” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our combined financial statements as of june 30 2007 we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 254 million of which 46 million expires in years 2009 through 2014 and 208 million which has an indefinite utilization period in addition we have estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards of a us subsidiary which is not included in our consolidated tax return of approximately 05 million as of june 30 2007 and us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 229 million which expire in 2023 through 2027 we have recorded valuation allowances of 219 million and 198 million at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings 

  

sharebased payments  sfas no 123r  “sharebased payment” requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options prior to july 1 2005 adp our former parent company followed accounting principles board opinion 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees “apb no 25” and related interpretations under apb no 25 stockbased compensation expense was not recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a 04 million change in total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a 03 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a 01 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period a hypothetical onehalf percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a 02 million change in the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period

analysis of consolidated and combined operations 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

the table below presents consolidated and combined statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended june 30 and the dollar and percentage changes between periods 

  

  total net revenues  our consolidated and combined net revenues for fiscal year 2007 were 21379 million an increase of 2046 million or 106 compared to 19333 million for fiscal year 2006 the increase reflects net revenue growth in our three business segments primarily driven by internal growth and to a lesser degree by net new business investor communication solutions net revenues increased 1542 million or 111 securities processing solutions net revenues increased 209 million or 44 and clearing and outsourcing solutions net revenues increased 132 million or 164 the growth in our net revenues was also favorably impacted by 65 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2007 were 3208 million an increase of 181 million or 60  compared to 3027 million for fiscal year 2006 and are attributable to higher net revenues and expenses as discussed above overall margin decreased from 157 to 150 for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 excluding onetime transition costs of 140 million fiscal year margin were flat when compared to fiscal year 2006 

provision for income taxes  our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 was 386 compared to 404 for fiscal year 2006 the decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a favorable mix of income among tax jurisdictions a lower effective us state income tax rate and the impact of a decrease in the amount of operating losses for which there is no tax benefit for fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

net earnings from continuing operations and basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  net earnings for fiscal year 2007 were 1971 million an increase of 166 million or 92 compared 

  

to 1805 million for fiscal year 2006 the higher net earnings from continuing operations reflects increased net revenues partially offset by increased expenses and a lower effective tax rate as described above basic and diluted eps from continuing operations increased 92 to 142 for fiscal year 2007 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

the table below presents combined statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended june 30 the dollar and percentage changes between periods 

 

 total net revenues  our combined net revenues for fiscal year 2006 were 19333 million an increase of 2162 million or 126 compared to 17171 million in fiscal year 2005 the increase was due to higher net revenues in investor communication solutions of 1759 million or 145 an increase in securities processing solutions of 148 million or 32 and an increase in clearing and outsourcing solutions of 191 million or 311 our net revenue growth was also favorably impacted by 91 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2006 were 3027 million an increase of 288 million or 105 compared to 2739 million during fiscal year 2005 due to the higher net revenues as discussed above overall margin decreased by 03 percentage points to 157 although we were able to leverage our expense levels with the increasing revenues and thereby improve margins on our services these improved margins were offset by the increase in our stock compensation expenses of 224 million due to the recording of stockbased compensation expense associated with our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan during fiscal year 2006 

provision for income taxes  our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 404 as compared to 393 for fiscal year 2005 the increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to the expensing of nondeductible components of stockbased compensation programs and a favorable tax settlement for fiscal year 2005 partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the amount of operating losses for which no tax benefit is provided for fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

net earnings from continuing operation and basic and diluted earnings per share  net earnings from continuing operations during fiscal year 2006 were 1805 million an increase of 141 million or 85 compared to 1664 million during fiscal year 2005 the increase in net earnings from continuing operations was due to higher net revenues partially offset by the additional expense associated with stockbased compensation and a higher effective tax rate as described above basic and diluted eps from continuing operations increased 83 to 130 for fiscal year 2006 

analysis of reportable segments 

investor communication solutions securities processing solutions and clearing and outsourcing solutions are the company’s reportable segments the primary components of “other” are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits certain unallocated expenses and interest expense foreign exchange differences are a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and fiscal year 2007 budgeted foreign exchange rates reportable segment net revenues and earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for prior years have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2007 budgeted foreign exchange rates for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 this adjustment is eliminated in consolidation and as such represents a reconciling difference to net revenues and earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 

certain corporate expenses as well as certain centrally managed expenses are allocated based upon budgeted amounts because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on among other factors segment profit the company may elect to record certain segment related expense items of an unusual or nonrecurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit 

beginning in january 2007 the company changed its methodology for charging the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment for services provided by the company’s other segments the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment is charged for services based on the other segments’ cost of providing such services prior to january 2007 the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment was billed for these services on a markup basis with the other segments recording revenue for the amount of these billings 

processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter the second quarter of the calendar year the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds historically this has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis

the cash flows from operating and financing activities for our clearing and outsourcing solutions segment differ from that of our other businesses brokerdealer and customer margin activities and transactions require the company to obtain financing from both internal and external sources additionally regulations associated with the brokerdealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers’ balances as a result management analyzes cash flows provided from operating and financing activities of the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment separately from all other businesses 

  

net cash flows used in provided by operating activities were as follows 

 

  net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses excluding the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 2982 million for fiscal year 2007 a decrease of 72 million compared to 3054 million for fiscal year 2006 the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher trade accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses net cash flows used in operating activities for the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 1377 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 1207 million for fiscal year 2006 at june 30 2005 the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment had a regulatory deposit reserve requirement of 1768 million which was released the following week resulting in a cash inflow of 1768 million there was no similar reserve at june 30 2006 during fiscal year 2007 receivables from customers and brokerdealers primarily in the form of margin loans increased 2916 million such loans were partially funded with additional cash from customer and brokerdealer accounts which increased 2188 million net cash outflows for fiscal year 2007 from these transactions were 728 million the remaining increase in margin loans was funded with external financing as described below additionally at june 30 2007 the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment had a regulatory deposit reserve of 259 million which resulted in a cash outflow of 259 million subsequent to june 30 2007 that reserve was released 

net cash flows used in investing activities were as follows 

 

 net cash flows used in investing activities for all businesses for fiscal year 2007 totaled 379 million compared to 208 million for the comparable period in the prior year this decrease was primarily due to net proceeds of 124 million received from bank of america related to the acquisition of its us clearing and brokerdealer services division and proceeds from the sale of the company’s investor communication solutions financial print business of 75 million in fiscal year 2006 partially offset by lower capital expenditures in fiscal year 2007 of 28 million 

  

net cash flows used in financing activities were as follows 

 

  net cash flows used in financing activities for all businesses excluding the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 2129 million for fiscal year 2007 an increase of 635 million compared to 2764 million for fiscal year 2006 this improvement was attributable to net proceeds the company received in connection with its offering of the senior notes and net proceeds from its credit facilities partially offset by payments to our former adp affiliated companies net cash flows provided by financing activities for the clearing and outsourcing solutions segment were 1289 million for the fiscal year 2007 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 1115 million for fiscal year 2006 the 1289 million provided in fiscal year 2007 was utilized to fund customer and noncustomer margin activity as well as regulatory deposit reserves as described above the 1115 million usage for fiscal year 2006 includes a net return of 1160 million previously borrowed from adp which was used to fund the 1768 million reserve described above 

income taxes 

prior to the distribution the company’s taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions except for us federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate subsequent to the distribution the company files its own us federal state and foreign returns 

the provision for income taxes is computed as if the company filed on a combined standalone or separate tax return basis as applicable the provision for income taxes does not reflect the company’s inclusion in the tax returns of adp or an adp affiliate certain income taxes of the company were paid by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company the payment of income taxes by adp or an adp affiliate on behalf of the company is recorded within adp’s net investment on the consolidated and combined balance sheets 

the company headquartered in the united states of america is routinely examined by the us internal revenue service the “irs” as part of the irs us federal income tax audit of adp and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the us states and foreign countries in which it conducts business the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction with respect to us federal income taxes the company was a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group through march 30 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidation the company is included in any irs examination of adp for periods up to and including march 30 2007 adp and the company are currently under irs audit for the years ended june 30 1998 through the year ended june 30 2002 which is expected to be substantially completed in fiscal year 2008 in addition the irs is conducting an examination of fiscal year 2003 through 2007 as a member of the adp us federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and adp the us federal income tax payable of the company for the period ended march 30 2007 will be assumed by adp in addition any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the irs attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier will be tax liabilities assumed by adp correspondingly any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the company for tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier which are settled favorably with the irs by adp will remain with adp accordingly the company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to us federal income taxes for the tax period ended march 30 2007 

  

the tax allocation agreement between the company and adp also extends to the company’s us state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets thus for any foreign or us state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended march 30 2007 or earlier attributable to the company’s business operations depending on the tax jurisdiction adp will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the company for tax payments the company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the consolidated and combined balance sheet of the company including the notes thereto as of june 30 2007 similarly to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended march 30 2007 or earlier adp will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the company for the refund received by the company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement 

the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments once established reserves are adjusted when there is more information available when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the combined financial condition of the company on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period or on the company’s effective tax rate 

defined benefit pension plans 

prior to the spinoff certain employees of the company were covered by adp’s domestic defined benefit plans in addition certain employees of the company were part of adp’s supplemental officer retirement plan “adp sorp” the adp sorp is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which adp will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation liabilities and assets related to these plans remain with adp domestic pension expense allocated to the company for the years ended june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 was 35 million 30 million and 23 million respectively adp sorp expense allocated to the company for the years ended june 30 2007 2006 and 2005 was 02 million 05 million and 03 million respectively 

the company’s board of directors approved a broadridge sponsored supplemental officer retirement plan “broadridge sorp” the broadridge sorp is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation the amount charged to expense for the broadridge sorp was 02 million in the year ended june 30 2007 broadridge does not sponsor any other defined benefit plans broadridge management believes the adp sorp and the broadridge sorp are not material to the company’s consolidated and combined financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company provides guarantees to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under the standard membership agreement members are required to guarantee the performance of the other members under the agreements if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse the other members would be required to meet any shortfalls the company’s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral however the potential for the company to be required to make payments under these arrangements is remote accordingly no contingent liability is carried on the consolidated and combined balance sheets for these transactions 

in the normal course of business the securities activities of the clearing and outsourcing solutions business primarily involve executions settlement and financing of various securities transactions for a nationwide retail and institutional customer and noncustomer client base introduced by its correspondent brokerdealers these activities may expose the company to risk in the event customers other brokers and dealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

the company’s clearing and outsourcing solutions segment conducts business with brokers and dealers clearing organizations and depositories that are primarily located in the new york area banking activities are conducted mainly with commercial banks located in the new york area and throughout the country to support customer securities activities of correspondent brokerdealers 

  

the company may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in the consolidated and combined balance sheets for securities sold not yet purchased should the value of such securities rise the securities lending activities of the company’s clearing and outsourcing solutions segment require the company to pledge securities as collateral in the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligation the company may be exposed to offbalance sheet risk of acquiring securities at prevailing market prices the company monitors the credit standing of counterparties with whom it conducts business risk is further controlled by monitoring the market value of securities pledged on a daily basis and by requiring adjustments of collateral level in the event of excess market exposure or instituting securities buyin procedures when required 

as of june 30 2007 3700 million of our total 7269 million in debt outstanding is based on floating interest rates our term loan facility had a balance outstanding of 3700 million as of june 30 2007 the interest rate is based on libor plus 40 to 90 basis points based on our debt rating at the time of borrowing the average interest rate was 584 in fiscal year 2007

principles of consolidation and reporting 

the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of br and its majorityowned subsidiaries all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation investments in entities in which the company has a significant ownership interest generally 20 to 50 percent or otherwise does not exercise control are accounted for using the equity method under the equity method the investments are stated at cost plus the company’s equity in undistributed earnings and losses the consolidated financial statements for previous periods include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to current presentation such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders’ equity 

stock split “split” 

all prior period common stock and applicable share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a 2for1 split of the company’s common stock effective june 1 2004 

cash and cash equivalents 

all shortterm investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market value 

inventories 

inventories of materials supplies and products are valued at the lower of average cost or market inventories consisted of the following 

 properties 

proved 

oil and gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method under this method all development costs and acquisition costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a unitofproduction basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves respectively costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when a well is determined to be unsuccessful 

the company evaluates the impairment of its proved oil and gas properties on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable unamortized capital costs are reduced to fair value if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset’s net book value cash flows are determined based upon reserves using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making the underlying commodity prices embedded in the company’s estimated cash flows are the product of a process that begins with the new york mercantile exchange pricing and adjusted for estimated location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices although prices used are

likely to approximate market they do not necessarily represent current market prices given that spot hydrocarbon market prices are subject to volatile changes it is the company’s opinion that a longterm look at market prices will lead to a more appropriate valuation of longterm assets 

costs of retired sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base are charged or credited net of proceeds to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unitofproduction amortization rate in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently gains or losses from the disposal of other properties are recognized currently expenditures for maintenance repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and gas properties are capitalized net of salvage at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unitofproduction basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

unproved 

unproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases “lease acquisition costs” as well as costs incurred to acquire unproved reserves unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite basis based on past success experience and average leaseterm lives unamortized lease acquisition costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unitofproduction basis the book value of the company’s unproved reserves which were acquired in connection with business acquisitions was determined using the same methods after adjusting for risks that were used to value the proved reserves acquired in the same acquisition because these reserves did not meet the strict definition of proved reserves the related costs were not classified as proved properties as the unproved reserves are developed and proven the associated costs are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unitofproduction basis the company assesses unproved reserves for impairment annually by comparing book value to fair value which is determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

exploration 

costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when a well is determined to be unsuccessful determination is usually made on or shortly after completing or drilling the well however in certain situations determination cannot be made when drilling is completed the company defers capitalized exploratory costs for wells that have found a sufficient quantity of producible hydrocarbons but cannot be classified as proved because they are located in areas that require major capital expenditures or governmental or other regulatory approvals before production can begin these costs continue to be deferred as wells in progress as long as development is underway is firmly planned for the near future or the necessary approvals are actively being sought for all other exploratory wells determination is made within one year from the date drilling and other necessary activities have been completed if a determination cannot be made after one year all costs associated with the well are expensed 

other 

other properties include gas plants pipelines buildings data processing and telecommunications equipment office furniture and equipment and other fixed assets these items are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straightline method based on expected lives of the individual assets or group of assets 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable rather than amortize 

revenue recognition 

natural gas ngls and crude oil revenues are recorded using the entitlement method under the entitlement method revenue is recorded when title passes based on the company’s net interest the company records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices the sales price for natural gas ngls and crude oil are adjusted for transportation cost and other related deductions the transportation costs and other deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment subsequently these deductions and 

45 burlington resources inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

transportation costs are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents historically these adjustments have been insignificant since there is a ready market for natural gas crude oil and ngls the company sells the majority of its products soon after production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer as a result the company maintains a minimum amount of product inventory in storage gas imbalances occur when the company sells more or less than its entitled ownership percentage of total gas production any amount received in excess of the company’s share is treated as a liability if the company receives less than it is entitled the underproduction is recorded as a receivable at december 31 2004 and 2003 the company had a net gas imbalance payable of 11 million and a net gas imbalance receivable of 19 million respectively of which 58 million and 69 million is recorded in accounts receivable and accounts payable respectively on the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 

the company utilizes buysell or exchange contracts to transport its crude oil from producing areas to a market center typically cushing oklahoma the company accounts for these transactions on a net basis in its consolidated statement of income 

royalty payable

commodity hedging contracts and other derivatives 

the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps to hedge future natural gas and crude oil production in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations the company also enters into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative are either recognized in income along with the corresponding change in fair value of the item being hedged for fairvalue hedges or deferred in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective for cashflow hedges to qualify for hedge accounting the derivative must qualify as either a fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedge 

the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective the company assesses hedge effectiveness based on total changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cashflow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production is delivered adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fairvalue hedging instrument becomes ineffective the balance in the fairvalue hedge adjustment account

is recognized in income when the hedged item is sold if the company determines that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 

gains and losses on hedging instruments and adjustments of the carrying amounts of hedged items are included in revenues and are included in realized prices in the period that the hedged item is sold gains and losses on hedging instruments which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenues in the period in which they occur the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities 

credit and market risks

treasury stock 

the company follows the weightedaveragecost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions 

stockbased compensation 

at december 31 2004 the company has three stockbased employee compensation plans which are described in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company uses the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stockbased compensation as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 and related interpretations under this method the company records no compensation expense for stock options granted when the exercise price for options granted is equal to the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

the weighted average fair values of options granted during the years 2004 2003 and 2002 were 550 543 and 542 respectively the fair values of employee stock options were calculated using the blackscholes stock option valuation model that has been modified to include dividends since the company has historically paid dividends additionally the company uses an expected term for stock options rather than the contractual term since they are nontransferable and are typically exercised prior to expiration the following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 2004 2003 and 2002 stock price volatility of 26 percent 32 percent and 31 percent respectively risk free rate of return ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent dividend yields of 089 percent 118 percent and 143 percent respectively and an expected term of 3 to 5 years

the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share had the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to its stockbased employee compensation 

 environmental costs 

environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

earnings per common share “eps” 

basic eps is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for computing basic eps was 392 million 398 million and 402 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if contracts to issue common stock and related stock options were exercised the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for computing diluted eps including dilutive stock options was 395 million 400 million and 404 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively all shares attributable to outstanding options were dilutive for the year ended december 31 2004 for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 2 million and 8 million shares respectively attributable to the assumed exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps because the effect was antidilutive the company has no preferred stock affecting eps and therefore no adjustments related to preferred stock were made to reported net income in the computation of eps 

use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves and related cash flow estimates used in impairment tests of goodwill and other longlived assets estimates of future development income taxes dismantlement and abandonment costs estimates relating to certain natural gas ngls and crude oil revenues and expenses as well as estimates of expenses related to legal environmental and other contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates

3 accounts receivable 

accounts receivable consisted of the following 

 4 goodwill 

the entire goodwill balance of 1054 million at december 31 2004 which is not deductible for tax purposes is related to the company’s acquisition of hunter in december 2001 with the acquisition of hunter the company gained hunter’s significant interest in canada’s deep basin north america’s thirdlargest natural gas field increased its critical mass and enhanced its position as a leading north american natural gas producer the company also obtained the exploration expertise of hunter’s workforce gained additional cost optimization increased purchasing power and gained greater marketing flexibility in optimizing sales and accessing key market information the goodwill was assigned to the company’s canadian reporting unit which includes all of the company’s canadian subsidiaries 

the provisions of sfas no 142 require that a twostep impairment test be performed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the first step of the test for impairment compares the book value of the company’s reporting unit to its estimated fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test which is only required when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its book value to determine if an impairment is required 

the company performed step one of its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2004 and determined that the fair value of the company’s canadian reporting unit exceeded its net book value as of september 30 2004 therefore step two was not required 

the fair value of the company’s canadian reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of expected future cash flows under the market approach the company estimated the fair value based on market multiples of reserves and production for comparable companies as well as recent comparable transactions 

the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and costs proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves appropriate discount rates and other variables downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit continued weakening of the us dollar or depressed natural gas ngls and crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods in the market approach the company makes certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums although the company based its fair value estimate on

assumptions it believes to be reasonable those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain in 2004 the company used a professional valuation services firm to assist in preparing its annual valuation of goodwill

the primary investment objective is to ensure over the longterm life of the pension plans an adequate pool of sufficiently liquid assets to support the benefit obligations to participants retirees and beneficiaries in meeting this objective the pension plans seek to achieve a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent level of portfolio risk while maintaining asset allocations within 5 percent of the target allocation shown above 

to develop the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption the company considered the current level of expected returns on riskfree investments primarily government bonds the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class since the company’s investment policy is to actively manage certain asset classes where the potential exists to outperform the broader market the expected returns for those asset classes were adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio this process resulted in the selection of the 75 percent assumption 

a 9 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of preage 65 covered health care benefits was assumed for 2005 the rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent for 2009 and remain at that level thereafter an 11 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of postage 65 covered health care benefits was assumed to gradually decrease to 5 percent for 2011 and remain at that level thereafter assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical and dental care plans a onepercentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects

legal proceedings 

the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims act these lawsuits were consolidated during 1999 and 2000 for pretrial proceedings by the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in the matter of in re natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united states district court for the district of wyoming “mdl1293” the plaintiffs contend that defendants underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on federal and indian lands through the use of belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies during the period of 1985 to the present plaintiffs allege that the royalties paid by defendants were lower than the royalties required to be paid under federal regulations and that the forms filed by defendants with the minerals management service “mms” reporting these royalty payments were false thereby violating the civil false claims act the united states has intervened in certain of the mdl1293 cases as to some of the defendants including the company the plaintiffs and the intervenor have not specified in their pleadings the amount of damages they seek from the company on december 5 2003 the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation entered an order transferring the cases alleging claims of belowmarket prices improper deductions and transactions with affiliated companies for further pretrial proceedings and trial in wright v agip 503cv264 united states district court for the eastern district of texas texarkana division all parties are proceeding with pretrial discovery and the trial of these cases is scheduled to begin in february 2007 the cases alleging improper measurement techniques remain pending in mdl1293 and motions to dismiss have been filed by the company and other defendants and are pending before the court 

various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the united states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of natural gas produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general these proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the company’s royalty payments over various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant federal regulations most of these proceedings involve production volumes and royalties that are the subject of natural gas royalties qui tam litigation 

based on the company’s present understanding of the various governmental and civil false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such defenses the company is also exploring the possibility of a settlement of these claims although there has been no formal demand for damages the company currently estimates based on its communications with the intervenor that the amount of underpaid royalties on onshore production claimed by the intervenor in these proceedings is approximately 76 million in the event that the company is found to have violated the civil false claims act the company could be subject to double damages civil monetary penalties and other sanctions including a temporary suspension from bidding on and entering into future federal mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time as an alternative to monetary penalties under the false claims act the intervenor has informed the company that it may seek the recovery of interest payments of approximately 95 million the company has established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to provide for this potential liability based upon its evaluation of this matter 

the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no 98854 filed in 1995 in the district court in the hague and currently pending in the court of appeal in the hague the netherlands plaintiffs who are working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that the company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger field in the l16a block unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly enriched by producing part of the oil from the adjoining q1 block the plaintiffs claim that the defendants infringed upon plaintiffs’ right to produce the minerals present in its

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

license area and acted in violation of generally accepted standards by failing to inform plaintiffs of the overlap of the logger field into the q1 block plaintiffs seek damages of 975 million as of january 1 1997 plus interest for all relevant periods the company owned a 375 percent working interest in the logger field following a trial the district court in the hague rendered a judgment in favor of the defendants including the company dismissing all claims plaintiffs thereafter appealed on october 19 2000 the court of appeal in the hague issued an interim judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that additional evidence be presented to the court relating to issues of both liability and damages after receiving additional evidence from the parties the court of appeals subsequently issued a ruling in favor of defendants in an interim judgment issued on december 18 2003 the court of appeals found that defendants should not have assumed that they were extracting oil from the q1 block that unocal was not entitled to compensation for any production occurring prior to 1992 and that damages if any would be limited to the proceeds unocal would have received for oil extracted from the q1 block less the costs unocal would have incurred to produce the oil from an existing well in the l16a block the court of appeals ordered that further evidence be presented to a court appointed expert to determine whether any damages had been suffered by unocal the company and the other defendants are continuing to present evidence to the court and vigorously assert defenses against these claims the company has also asserted claims of indemnity against two of the defendants from whom it had acquired a portion of its working interest share if the company is successful in enforcing the indemnities its working interest share of any adverse judgment could be reduced to 15 percent for some of the periods covered by plaintiffs’ lawsuit based on the information known to date the company believes that unocal suffered no damages in excess of the costs of production and that the company will incur no liability in this matter other than the costs of litigation the company has not established a reserve for this matter since it currently does not believe that an unfavorable outcome is probable 

the company and its former affiliate el paso natural gas company have also been named as defendants in two class action lawsuits styled bank of america et al v el paso natural gas company et al  case no cj9768 and deane w moore et al v burlington northern inc et al  case no cj97132 each filed in 1997 in the district court of washita county state of oklahoma and subsequently consolidated by the court plaintiffs contend that defendants underpaid royalties from 1982 to the present on natural gas produced from specified wells in oklahoma through the use of belowmarket prices improper deductions and transactions with affiliated companies and in other instances failed to pay or delayed in the payment of royalties on certain gas sold from these wells the plaintiffs seek an accounting and damages for alleged royalty underpayments plus interest from the time such amounts were allegedly due plaintiffs additionally seek the recovery of punitive damages the plaintiffs have not specified in their pleadings the amount of damages they seek from the company however through pretrial discovery plaintiffs have provided defendants with alternative theories of recovery claiming monetary damages of up to 221 million in principal plus 996 million in interest and unspecified punitive damages and attorney’s fees the company believes it has substantial defenses to these claims and is vigorously asserting such defenses the company and el paso natural gas company have asserted contractual claims for indemnity against each other the court has certified the plaintiff classes of royalty and overriding royalty interest owners and the parties are proceeding with pretrial discovery it is anticipated that the trial of this matter will be scheduled during 2005 the company has established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to provide for this potential liability based upon its evaluation of this matter 

the company received notice on october 19 2004 from the united states department of justice that it may be one of many potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended with respect to the remediation of a site known as the castex systems inc oil field waste disposal site in jefferson davis parish near jennings louisiana according to the department of justice the remediation of the site has been completed under the supervision of the united states environmental protection agency for a total cost of approximately 3 million the company has been informed that it may have contributed up to two and onehalf percent 25  of the liquid oil field waste and twelve percent 12 of the solid oil field waste identified at the site the company has signed an agreement tolling the statute of limitations for a period of approximately three months and is currently investigating this matter to determine if it is liable for any portion of the remediation costs 

in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including claims for personal injury and property damage claims challenging oil and gas royalty ad valorem and severance tax payments claims related to joint interest billings under oil and gas operating agreements claims alleging mismeasurement of volumes and wrongful analysis of heating content of natural gas and other claims in the nature of contract regulatory or employment disputes none of the governmental proceedings involve foreign governments 

while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these legal proceedings and environmental matters through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company although cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

at december 31 2004 the company’s consolidated balance sheet included reserves for legal proceedings of 84 million and environmental matters of 15 million the accrual of reserves for legal and environmental matters is included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that the company could incur additional loss the amount of which is not currently estimable in excess of the amounts currently accrued with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and the amounts accrued based on currently available information we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures for legal proceedings and environmental matters will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company although cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such costs are incurred

re proved reserves as of december 31 2004 

gentlemen 

at your request we reviewed the estimates of domestic and international proved reserves of oil condensate natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls that burlington resources inc br attributes to its net interests in oil and gas properties as of december 31 2004 br’s estimates of proved reserves shown below are in accordance with the definitions contained in securities and exchange commission regulation sx rule 410a 

 based on our investigations and subject to the limitations described hereinafter it is our judgment that 1 br has an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate its proved reserves 2 in making its estimates br uses appropriate engineering geologic and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally accepted in the petroleum industry and 3 the results of the estimates prepared by br that we reviewed are in the aggregate reasonable 

gas volumes were estimated at the appropriate pressure base and temperature base established for each well or field by the applicable sales contract or regulatory body total gas reserves were obtained by summing the reserves for all the individual properties and are therefore stated at a mixed pressure base 

in conducting our audit we reviewed br’s estimates of wet gas volumes prior to adjustment for impurities shrinkage and ngl recovery we reviewed these wet gas volumes along with the methods employed by br to convert these volumes to sales gas volumes and ngls in our judgment the conversion methods used by br to adjust the wet volumes to account for impurities fuel use shrinkage and ngl recovery are appropriate and reasonable 

we reviewed approximately 84 percent of br’s estimated proved reserves forecasts and either accepted their forecast or revised it as needed we selected the sampling of properties for independent estimates and review in general those properties with the largest reserves were selected for review we investigated the pertinent available engineering geological and accounting information to satisfy ourselves that br’s reserve estimates are in the aggregate reasonable in making our reserve estimates and comparing them with br’s estimates we used product prices and expenses provided by br the prices used were represented by br as the actual prices received for oil condensate natural gas and ngls on december 31 2004 and are in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidelines 

 page 2 

these reserve estimates are based primarily on decline curve analysis material balance calculations volumetric calculations analogies or combinations of these methods reserve estimates from volumetric calculations and from analogies are often less certain than reserve estimates based on well performance obtained over a period during which a substantial portion of the reserves were produced 

in conducting these evaluations we relied upon production histories accounting data and other financial operating engineering geological and geophysical data supplied by br to a lesser extent data existing in the files of miller and lents ltd and data obtained from commercial services were used we also relied without independent verification upon br’s representation of its ownership interests for each property 

miller and lents ltd is an independent oil and gas consulting firm no director officer or key employee of miller and lents ltd has any financial ownership in burlington resources inc or any affiliated company our compensation for the required investigations and preparation of this report is not contingent on the results obtained and reported and we have not performed other work that would affect our objectivity production of this report was supervised by an officer of the firm who is a professionally qualified and licensed professional engineer in the state of texas with more than 20 years of relevant experience in the estimation assessment and evaluation of oil and gas reserves 

the evaluations presented in this report with the exceptions of those parameters specified by others reflect our informed judgments based on accepted standards of professional investigation but are subject to those generally recognized uncertainties associated with interpretation of geological geophysical and engineering information government policies and market conditions different from those employed in this study may cause the total quantity of oil or gas to be recovered actual production rates prices received or operating and capital costs to vary from those reviewed for this report

 gentlemen 

at your request we have examined the proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves estimates of burlington resources incorporated “burlington” canadian properties as of december 31 2004 our examination included such tests and procedures as we considered necessary under the circumstances to render the opinion set forth herein 

table 1 presents burlington’s estimates of proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves which are in accordance with the definitions contained in securities and exchange commission regulation sx rule 410a 

table 1 

summary of burlington resources incorporated canadian proved reserves estimates 

using net marketable gas volumes 

 the volumes of natural gas liquids are comprised of ethane propane butanes condensate and pentanes plus all volumes are reported net after royalties 

we are independent with respect to burlington as provided in the standard pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 

our audit does not constitute a complete reserves study of the oil and gas properties of burlington in the conduct of our audit we did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by burlington with respect to ownership interests oil and gas production historical costs of operation and development product prices agreements relating to current and future operations and sales of production etc burlington’s canadian reserves assignments were audited directly by a citrix link into the peep reserves database and by reviewing available public data to determine if those assignments were reasonable if in the course of our examination something came to our attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data we did not rely on such information or data until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto or independently verified such information or data 

the proved developed producing reserves and production forecasts were estimated by production decline extrapolations wateroil ratio trends material balance or by volumetric calculations for some properties with insufficient performance history to establish trends we estimated future production by analogy with other properties with similar characteristics the past performance trends of many properties were influenced by production curtailments workovers waterfloods andor infill drilling actual future production may require that our estimated trends be significantly altered 

the estimated proved undeveloped reserves require significant capital expenditures for items such as the drilling completion and tiein of wells the proved undeveloped reserves estimates for infill wells are based on analogies to similar infill wells in the same field andor the production histories of offset wells in the same field 

reserve estimates from volumetric calculations and from analogies are often less certain than reserves estimates based on well performance obtained over a period during which a substantial portion of the reserves was produced 

the reserves estimates presented in this report with the exceptions of those parameters specified by others reflect our informed judgements based on accepted standards of professional investigation but are subject to those generally recognized uncertainties associated with interpretation of geological geophysical and engineering information government policies and market conditions different from those employed in this review may cause the total quantity of oil or gas to be recovered actual production rates prices received or operating and capital costs to vary from those estimated in this audit 

in our opinion the estimates of burlington’s proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles as set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers

controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of certain members of the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e to the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” based on this evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer believe that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report with respect to timely communicating to them and other members of management responsible for preparing periodic reports all material information required to be disclosed in this report as it relates to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 

the company’s management does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some person or by collusion of two or more people the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected accordingly the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and as set forth above the company’s management has concluded based on their evaluation as of the end of the period that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met 

there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting see page 38 for management report on internal control over financial reporting

1 us san juan basin the san juan basin in northwest new mexico and southwest colorado is one of the company’s major operating areas in terms of reserves and production the san juan basin encompasses nearly 7500 square miles or approximately 48 million acres with the major portion located in new mexico’s rio arriba and san juan counties the company is a significant holder of productive leasehold acreage in this area with over 840000 net acres under its control the company operates almost 7300 well completions in the san juan basin and holds interests in an additional 4300 nonoperated well completions in 2003 the company invested 115 million in oil and gas capital excluding acquisitions that included 322 new wells and approximately 585 workovers of existing wells the company’s net production from the san juan basin averaged approximately 546 mmcf of natural gas per day 313 mbbls of ngls per day and 12 mbbls of crude oil per day during 2003 production from the san juan basin grew significantly during the 1990s first as a result of fruitland coal drilling and then as a result of development of tight gas formations by the end of the decade all formations were experiencing some decline to mitigate fruitland coal production decline the company has an ongoing program that consists of performing workovers on existing wells adding compression and installing artificial lift where appropriate the company also developed 35 bcfe of additional fruitland coal reserves by drilling new wells on 320acre and 160acre spacing and added 34 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves in 2003 net production from the fruitland coal averaged 199 mmcf of natural gas per day from over 1700 completions in 2003 the new mexico oil and gas conservation division nmocd granted approval to allow infill drilling on 160acre spacing in the highproductivity portion of the fruitland coal pool the approval by the nmocd made available many drilling opportunities that are expected to result in additional production and reserves in san juan also in 2003 the company repurchased three production interests in properties related to coalbed methane production these repurchases added net annualized volumes of 79 mmcf of natural gas per day and 95 bcfe of reserves at a price of approximately 80 million yielding an average acquisition cost of about 084 per mcfe the three conventional formations mesaverde pictured cliffs and dakota located in the san juan basin continue to provide attractive development opportunities for the company the mesaverde formation which consists of the lewis shale cliffhouse menefee and point lookout sands is the largest producing tight gas formation in the san juan basin in 2003 the company continued its ongoing infill drilling program in this formation by developing 115 bcfe of reserves in the dakota formation the company developed 40 bcfe of additional reserves by drilling new wells on 160acre and 80acre spacing during 2003 and added 274 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves net production from the tight gas producing formations averaged 347 mmcf of natural gas per day and 313 mbbls of ngls per day during the year the company continued its cost management efforts in the san juan basin yearoveryear net operated capital costs for likekind projects were essentially flat to 2002 as a result of a variety of process improvements similarly lease operating expenses were reduced by 15 million from 2002 despite inflationary and operational cost pressures resulting in unit costs per mcfe being essentially flat to 2002 this was achieved primarily through compression optimization and cost savings for produced water disposal wind river basin the madden field located in the wind river basin covers more than 70000 acres in wyoming’s fremont and natrona counties net production averaged 88 mmcf of natural gas per day in 2003 from multiple horizons ranging in depth from 5000 feet to over 25000 feet where the deep madison formation occurs investments in the wind river basin during 2003 totaled 19 million for approximately 56 newly drilled wells and workover projects in the deep madison and shallower formations during the summer of 2003 the company elected to shutin natural gas production from the deep madison wells after localized pipe deformations were found during inspection of the field’s highpressure gathering system by year end the company had completed repairs on four gathering lines largely restoring production two other gathering lines are producing at reduced rates pending further repairs scheduled for mid2004 in addition the final gathering line is also expected to be completed at that time the company spent 4 million for repairs to the deep madison gathering system in 2003 the big horn 94 the last of the planned deep development wells began producing in midnovember 2003 the company owns an approximate 50 percent working interest in the lost cabin gas plant and a 42 percent net revenue interest in the madison reservoir williston basin the williston basin operations in western north dakota and eastern montana are primarily focused on the cedar creek anticline total williston basin production averaged 13 mbbls of crude oil per day and 4 mmcf of natural gas per day during 2003 the company invested 66 million on horizontal drilling and workover projects primarily located in the cedar hills south and east lookout butte waterflood units 

2 the company continued its highly active waterflood development program at the cedar hills unit by drilling 24 wells extending 33 existing horizontal wells and increasing water injection volumes seven of these newly drilled wells are testing 160acre infill spacing this spacing is also being pilot tested in east lookout butte and was expanded in 2003 with the addition of 11 wells these pilots are being monitored to further assess the feasibility of infill drilling on 160acre spacing to improve the efficiency of the waterflood anadarko basin the anadarko basin located principally in western oklahoma encompasses over 30000 square miles and contains some of the deepest producing formations in the world the company controls over 250000 net acres and produces from multiple horizons ranging in depth from 11000 feet to over 21000 feet net production for 2003 from the anadarko basin averaged 78 mmcf of natural gas per day and 04 mbbls of ngls per day during 2003 the company invested 27 million in the anadarko basin operated activity focused on the red fork formation in roger mills county oklahoma where the company drilled 19 wells permian basin permian basin operations in west texas are focused on the waddell ranch field total permian basin production in 2003 averaged 15 mmcf of natural gas per day 35 mbbls of crude oil per day and 16 mbbls of ngls per day with the waddell ranch field contributing 11 mmcf of natural gas per day 28 mbbls of crude oil per day and 16 mbbls of ngls per day during 2003 the company invested 9 million in permian basin operations fort worth basin the fort worth basin of north central texas had a significant increase in activity in 2003 for the company following the 2002 acquisition of a largely undeveloped barnett shale formation acreage position in denton county texas net volumes increased from 18 mmcf of natural gas per day 03 mbbls of ngls per day and 03 mbbls of crude oil per day at the beginning of the year to 34 mmcf of natural gas per day 41 mbbls of ngls per day and 11 mbbls of crude oil per day at year end the company employed up to nine rigs during the year to drill 163 wells in the barnett shale formation including a twowell pilot program to test horizontal well technology the company invested 90 million in 2003 with production averaging 28 mmcf of natural gas per day 21 mbbls of ngls per day and 07 mbbls of crude oil per day onshore gulf coast the onshore gulf coast includes a number of drilling trends in south louisiana as well as 660000 acres of fee lands where the company owns the mineral rights and surface lands in 2003 the company invested 75 million in 52 drilling workover and facilities projects in south louisiana net production for 2003 averaged 94 mmcf of natural gas per day 66 mbbls of crude oil per day and 12 mbbls of ngls per day canada western canadian sedimentary basin in the western canadian sedimentary basin the company’s portfolio of opportunities includes conventional exploration and development in alberta british columbia and saskatchewan as well as frontier exploration in the mackenzie delta in the northwest territories canadian activity in 2003 focused on production growth reserve additions and cost control on the integrated assets acquired since 1999 by expanding original activity into largescale repeatable drilling programs in conventional and lower permeability reservoirs oil and gas capital investment in canada was 679 million including acquisitions and resulted in the completion of 737 gross wells the deep basin area in alberta and british columbia consists of the elmworth wapiti noel and brassey fields the company acquired interests in 84000 acres of mineral rights through crown land sales in alberta and british columbia this included approximately 40000 acres in the brassey area to extend drilling activity in the tight gas trend in 2003 a 256 million oil and gas capital program was focused on exploration and development in the deep basin area as a result 180 wells were drilled and 233 mmcf of natural gas per day and 156 mbbls of ngls per day were produced from this area representing a 12 percent increase year over year in the deep basin the 2003 program focused on continued exploitation of tight gas reservoirs in the cadomin and chinook formations regulatory approval to reduce well spacing in the cadomin from 640acres to 320acres was expanded from a 33section area at the start of the year to 83 sections with an additional 32 sections pending final regulatory approval as a result of the downspacing approvals the company drilled 28 infill wells in the cadomin formation in the elmworth area and 19 infill wells in the chinook formation 

3 the o’chiese and whitecourt areas in central alberta yielded 2003 production of 226 mmcf of natural gas per day 89 mbbls of ngls per day and 27 mbbls of crude oil per day the o’chiese and whitecourt areas were the focus of a 156 million exploration and development program in 2003 that mostly targeted the lower cretaceous and jurassic sands the principal historical targets a total of 168 wells were drilled including 26 wells in shallow gas formations the company continued exploration and development activities in the greater ring border area on the border of northern alberta and british columbia production in this area during 2003 averaged 111 mmcf of natural gas per day and 19 mbbls of ngls per day a capital program in this area of 72 million targeted the bluesky gething and montney formations and 101 wells were drilled this included 19 wells that extended the gutah discovery west of the ring border unit the kahntah field lying northwest of the ring border field was also brought onstream to the existing ring border plant in the kaybob area production for the year averaged 69 mmcf of natural gas per day and 07 mbbls of ngls per day this represents production growth of 54 percent over 2002 during 2003 the company invested 78 million drilled 59 wells in the lower cretaceous formation and expanded the wholly owned berland river gas processing plant the viking kinsella property produced approximately 87 mmcf of natural gas per day in 2003 a 42 percent increase over 2002 an additional 79 wells were drilled on the property in 2003 the infrastructure was expanded with the purchase of a gas processing plant at scoville lake and the construction of a new gas processing plant at vernon lake mackenzie delta in the mackenzie delta a successful exploration well was drilled at the langley k30 location resulting in a discovery from the eocene taglu formation other international the company’s other international operations include a combination of exploration projects large field development projects and production operations key focus areas are northwest europe north africa china and south america  northwest europe operations in northwest europe provided the majority of the company’s production outside of north america during 2003 from assets in the east irish sea and in the dutch sector of the north sea the east irish sea assets consist of eight licenses covering 249000 acres the company has a 100 percent working interest in seven operated gas fields first production from two sweet gas fields millom and dalton commenced in 1999 a new subsea well was completed during mid2003 bringing the total number of producing wells in the millom and dalton fields to nine net production from the east irish sea averaged 96 mmcf of natural gas per day during 2003 the company invested 218 million of capital in this area including 108 million of oil and gas capital in 2003 the development of the sour gas fields in the east irish sea continued with first production planned by mid2004 during 2003 three production wells were completed from the offshore platform and tested at a combined rate of over 180 mmcf of natural gas per day the pipeline transporting gas from these offshore facilities was also completed during 2003 and construction work continued on the new onshore terminal that will process the sour gas prior to sale 

4 the company’s remaining northwest european shelf operations consist of nonoperated production from the clam venture in the dutch offshore sector during the second quarter of 2003 the company acquired the remaining 50 interest in clam for a purchase price of approximately 100 million including cash acquired at closing of 25 million the clam assets yielded an annual production rate of 43

accounting for the higher yearend production the company’s capital investments in this area in 2003 totaled 71 million the ourhoud field in which the company has a 37 percent working interest produced throughout the year some operational difficulties with crude oil export pumps prevented the field from producing at its targeted rate until the final few weeks of the year during 2003 net production was 41 mbbls of crude oil per day during early 2003 the final required exploration well in block 405a mlse8 was drilled this well was a minor natural gas discovery in shallow zones however a subsequent test of deeper horizons for producible hydrocarbons failed to flow the well has been suspended pending possible future use in a gas development subsequent to drilling the mlse8 well a final relinquishment of nondevelopment areas in block 405a was submitted to sonatrach the algerian national oil company and awaits finalization in the akfadou psc block 402d in which the company has a 75

10 in the company’s business include price contract terms quality of service pipeline access transportation discounts and distribution efficiencies 

regulation of oil and gas production sales and transportation — the oil and gas industry is subject to regulation by numerous national state and local governmental agencies and departments throughout the world compliance with these regulations is often difficult and costly and noncompliance could result in substantial penalties and risks most jurisdictions in which the company operates also have statutes rules regulations or guidelines governing the conservation of natural resources including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties and the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells some jurisdictions also require the filing of drilling and operating permits bonds and reports the failure to comply with these statutes rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties and the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas the company operates various gathering systems the united states department of transportation and certain governmental agencies regulate the safety and operating aspects of the transportation and storage activities of these facilities by prescribing standards however based on current standards concerning transportation and storage activities and any proposed or contemplated standards the company believes that the impact of such standards is not material to the company’s operations capital expenditures or financial position compliance with such standards has been incorporated by the company in its operations over many years and no material capital expenditures are allocated to such compliance all of the company’s sales of its domestic natural gas are currently deregulated although governmental agencies may elect in the future to regulate certain sales environmental regulation — various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including the discharge of materials into the environment may affect the company’s domestic exploration development and production operations and the costs of those operations in addition the company’s international operations are subject to environmental regulations administered by foreign governments including political subdivisions thereof or by international organizations these domestic and international laws and regulations among other things govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment the issuance of permits to conduct exploration drilling and production operations the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials the reclamation and abandonment of wells sites and facilities and the remediation of contaminated sites these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance and for any contamination resulting from the company’s operations and may require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas the environmental laws and regulations applicable to the company and its operations include among others the following united states federal laws and regulations  in addition many states and foreign countries where the company operates have similar environmental laws and regulations covering the same types of matters in canada environmental compliance is governed by various statutes regulations and codes promulgated at different levels of government including the federal fisheries act and canadian environmental protection act and provincially the environmental protection and enchancement act the oil and gas conservation act and the pipeline act in the province of alberta and the waste management act the environmental assessment act and the environment management act in the province of british columbia the company routinely obtains permits for its facilities and operations in accordance with these applicable laws and regulations on an ongoing basis there are no known issues that have a significant adverse effect on the permitting process or permit compliance status of any of the company’s facilities or operations the ultimate financial impact of these environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determined as new standards continue to evolve environmental laws and regulations are expected to have an increasing impact on 

11 the company’s operations in the united states and in most countries in which it operates potential permitting costs are variable and directly associated with the type of facility and its geographic location costs for example may be incurred for air emission permits spill contingency requirements and discharge or injection permits these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of the company’s ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance with government regulations 

the company is committed to the protection of the environment throughout its operations and believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company believes that environmental stewardship is an important part of its daily business and will continue to make expenditures on a regular basis relating to environmental compliance the company maintains insurance coverage for spills pollution and certain other environmental risks although it is not fully insured against all such risks the insurance coverage maintained by the company provides for the reimbursement to the company of costs incurred for the containment and cleanup of materials that may be suddenly and accidentally released in the course of the company’s operations the company does not anticipate that it will be required under current environmental laws and regulations to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company however because regulatory requirements frequently change and may become more stringent and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in the company’s operations there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future filings of reserve estimates with other agencies — during 2003 the company filed estimates of its oil and gas reserves for the year 2002 with the department of energy these estimates differ by 5 percent or less from the reserve data presented for information concerning proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves see page 70

which are conducive to large multiwell repeatable drilling programs and the company’s technical skills internationally the company is focused on the startup and delivery of several key projects basin excellence sm is the company’s concept of concentrating its operations and expertise in core areas where it believes it holds significant competitive advantages these areas are typically in high potential geologic basins with large crude oil and natural gas resources that support multipleyear development programs these are also areas where the company holds significant land or mineral interest positions has teams with years of relevant geologic geophysical engineering and operational experience has access to production processing and gathering infrastructure and has excellent relations with partners suppliers and land and mineral interest owners the company believes that it has attained or will ultimately attain this stature in several areas throughout the world that currently represent the majority of its core assets these assets traditionally yield high returns on investment and therefore the company has concentrated its activities in these areas and exited other areas that did not meet these standards the company has adopted a very disciplined capital allocation process with the objective of achieving volumetric growth in the range of three to eight percent as a longterm annual average coupled with strong financial returns in managing its business the company must deal with numerous risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties can be broadly categorized as “subsurface” which includes the presence size and recoverability of hydrocarbons “regulatory” which includes access and permitting necessary to conduct its operations “operational” which includes logistical timing and infrastructure issues especially internationally which is often beyond the company’s control and “commercial” which includes commodity price volatility local price differentials in its various areas of operations and attention to operating margins each of these factors is challenging and highly variable to address subsurface risks the company utilizes most of the latest technological tools available to assess and mitigate these risks these tools include but are not limited to modern geophysical data and interpretation software petrophysical information physical core data production histories paleontology data and satellite imagery in spite of these technologies the multitude of unknown variables that exist below the surface of the earth make it difficult to consistently and accurately predict drilling results the company has put considerable emphasis in recent years on creating an asset portfolio that improves the reliability of those predictions however these types of operations tend to exploit or develop smaller quantities of hydrocarbon reserves and as a result the company must develop more of these opportunities in order to maintain production similarly the company has reduced its focus on areas where there is far less analytical data available and drilling outcomes are less predictable such as wildcat exploration operations in sparsely explored areas the company is constantly assessing its drilling opportunities to achieve balance in its drilling program for risk and financial returns in order to make this possible the company attempts to maintain a large inventory of drillable projects from which its technical and management teams can select a drilling program in any given period on regulatory and operational matters the company actively manages its exploration and production activities the company values sound stewardship and strong relationships with all stakeholders in conducting its business the company attempts to stay abreast of emerging issues to effectively anticipate and manage potential impacts to the company’s operations at the company managing the commercial risks is an ongoing priority considerable analysis of historical price trends supply statistics demand projections and infrastructure constraints form the basis of the company’s outlook for the commodity prices it may receive for its future production because much of this data is very dynamic the company’s view and the market’s view of future commodity pricing can change rapidly based on the company’s ongoing assessment of the underlying data and the markets the company will from time to time use various financial tools to hedge the price it will receive for a particular commodity in the future the primary purpose of these activities is to provide for sector leading financial returns on the significant investments that the company makes annually to replenish its productive base and grow its reserves while leaving as much commodity price upside as possible for the company’s stockholders margin enhancement is another important element of the company’s business including attention to cash operating and administrative costs and marketing activities such as securing transportation to alternative market hubs to protect against weak producingarea prices the company may also enter into transportation agreements that allow the company to sell a portion of its production in alternative markets when local prices are weak all of the risks and uncertainties described above create opportunities in the exploration and production business to the extent they drive the relative valuations of three distinct asset classes in the business the first asset class is the 

14 commodities themselves—natural gas ngls and crude oil the prices for this asset class are generally established by the purchasers of these commodities but closely track the prices that are set through the public trading of futures contracts for those same commodities the second asset class consists of the physical oil and gas properties that may contain proved probable and possible reserves as well as exploratory potential the value of physical assets are usually established in a private market created by a willing seller and a willing buyer of a given property or group of properties the third asset class consists of the equities of the publicly traded exploration and production companies that are valued in the public market place daily because these three asset classes are not always valued consistently with each other opportunities may exist from time to time to take advantage of these various valuation differences these valuation differences are key to the company’s capital allocation philosophy 

at the company there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital these include drilling opportunities acquisition opportunities and financial alternatives such as share repurchases dividends and debt repayment depending on circumstances and the relative valuations of the asset classes described above the company allocates capital among its investment alternatives which is an allocation approach that is rateofreturn based its goal is to ensure that capital is being invested in the highest return opportunities available at any given time much of what has been described above is conducted and handled routinely the ability of the company’s management and staff to take into account all relevant factors which fluctuate constantly will be a key determinant in the company’s future performance outlook the company’s business model strives to achieve both production growth and sectorleading financial returns when compared to other independent oil and gas exploration and production companies this model requires the continuous development of natural gas and crude oil reserves to fuel growth while maintaining a rigorous focus on cost structure and capital efficiency key to achieving the company’s financial goals is its disciplined capital investment approach the company deploys the net operating cash flows it generates among its core capital programs as well as acquisitions and other financial uses such as share repurchases and dividend payments although commodity prices are volatile the company generally does not favor increasing or decreasing its capital program in response to commodity prices instead the company seeks to exercise a disciplined approach in order to keep its cost structure as low as possible the company expects to continue focusing on exploring for and producing north american natural gas as its primary business as of yearend 2003 about 90 percent of the company’s natural gas and crude oil production was in north america while the company’s management recognizes that the north american natural gas business has many characteristics of a mature slowgrowth business it believes that finding or acquiring and producing north american natural gas will continue to be a profitable highreturn business for the company due to certain unique advantages that position it to be successful first the company has longlived asset positions in gas resourceprone basins secondly the company has production decline rates that it believes are lowerthanindustryaverages in addition the company focuses heavily on maintaining a competitive cost structure finally the company employs a capital allocation approach that favors discipline and balance the company’s international business segment is less mature but is currently undergoing a significant growth phase following several years of major project development as a result the international business is expected to represent about 15 percent of the company’s natural gas and crude oil production in 2004 and remain at a level of 15 percent to 20 percent for the foreseeable future a discussion of the company’s reserve replacement costs and capital expenditures follow reserve replacement  

15 capital expenditures   finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to the company’s longterm success in 2003 the company’s reserve replacement costs were 123 per mcfe excluding acquisitions or 119 per mcfe including acquisitions the company replaced 142 percent of its worldwide production from all sources and 118 percent of its worldwide production excluding acquisitions during 2003 in 2004 the company expects to spend approximately 15 billion of capital for oil and gas activities excluding acquisitions this level is roughly the same as recent years and represents the level of investment the company believes is needed in each of the next few years to achieve its stated target of three to eight percent average annual production growth approximately 85 percent of the company’s 2004 capital program is allocated to its north american programs in canada and the us this represents an increase of approximately 10 percent from prior years primarily due to the fact that significant international project development spending was largely completed in 2003 in north america in 2004 the company is allocating a higher percentage of its capital investment to the us given the higher canadian service costs and the weakening of the us dollar below is a discussion of the company’s production growth production  the company has a goal to achieve between three and eight percent average annual production growth in 2003 production volumes were 2567 mmcfe per day essentially flat to 2002’s volumes however when considering production volumes related to assets that were retained following the 2002 divestiture program production volumes increased about 10 percent compared to 2002 in 2004 the company expects production volumes to average between 2665 and 2879 mmcfe per day this production growth is expected to be driven by steady production growth in north america and accelerating production growth from several international projects in 2004 the company expects production growth in canada as a result of the investment in its large repeatable development programs such as in the deep basin in the us the company expects production growth as a result of restoring full production at the madden field by midyear 2004 as well as increased production from cedar creek barnett shale and south louisiana drilling programs internationally the company expects to maintain production in algeria increase production in offshore china and initiate startup of the sour gas fields in the east irish sea by midyear 2004 while these activities are subject to the risks and delays inherent to this business as discussed above the company believes that these sources of production growth are currently available and is now focused on identifying sources of production growth for the future financial returns in addition to the company’s production growth goal it is committed to generating sectorleading returns on capital employed when compared to other independent oil and gas exploration and production companies while commodity prices play a very significant role in the company’s financial returns the company focuses on controllable elements such as certain operating costs in 2004 the company expects to keep its operating and administrative costs about the same as 2003 on a per unit of production basis however it expects depletion and depreciation expense to increase about 10 to 15 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of rate changes related to canadian and other international properties and unfavorable exchange rate impacts other costs could also increase as a result of unfavorable exchange rate impacts in canada although subject to the upward cost pressures generally experienced by 

16 the industry the company believes it can differentiate its performance from that of its peers as a result of several initiatives underway to maintain its diligence on costs specifically in the areas of purchasing continuous process improvement and knowledge transfer the company will continue to focus on capital efficiency and cost control 

commodity prices commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of the company’s control historically commodity prices have been volatile and the company expects them to remain that way in the future commodity prices are affected by changes including but not limited to supply market demands overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result the company cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngls and crude oil prices and therefore it cannot determine what impact increases or decreases in production volumes will have on future revenues or net operating cash flows however based on average daily natural gas production in 2003 the company estimates that a 010 per mcf change in natural gas prices would have an impact on annual revenues of approximately 69 million also based on average daily crude oil production in 2003 the company estimates that a 100 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an impact on annual revenues of approximately 17 million potential acquisitions while it is difficult to predict future plans with respect to acquisitions the company actively seeks acquisition opportunities that build upon the company’s existing core asset basins and conform to its basin excellence sm concept although the company does not plan major acquisitions they play a large role in this industry’s consolidation and must be considered generally acquisitions for the company fall into one of two categories bolton transactions and other acquisitions bolton transactions are usually relatively small and involve acquiring properties and assets in areas where the company already controls a core position other acquisitions tend to be transactions that involve the company acquiring a core position in an area where it either has no position or a relatively small position in either case the purpose of acquiring assets is to assist the company in adding to its existing inventory of future growth opportunities depending on the commodity price environment at any given time the property acquisition market can be extremely competitive because of its focus on sectorleading financial returns the company takes a very disciplined approach to property acquisitions making it very difficult to predict the number and frequency of future transactions financial condition and liquidity the company’s total debt to total capital total capital is defined as total debt and stockholders’ equity ratio at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 was 41 percent and 51 percent respectively in december 2003 the company retired canadian 100 million us 75 million of 640 notes the 20 percent reduction in total debt to total capital was attributable to the company’s strong net income coupled with the strength of the canadian currency and the retirement of debt partially offset by the repurchase of common stock based on the current price environment the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund its 2004 capital expenditures excluding any potential major acquisitions at december 31 2003 the company had 757 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand burlington resources capital trust i burlington resources capital trust ii collectively the trusts br and burlington resources finance company brfc have a shelf registration statement of 1500 million on file with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the registration statement br may issue debt securities shares of common stock or preferred stock in addition brfc may issue debt securities and the trusts may issue trust preferred securities net proceeds terms and pricing of offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings brfc and the trusts are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of br and have no independent assets or operations other than transferring funds to br’s subsidiaries any debt issued by brfc is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by br any trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are also fully and unconditionally guaranteed by br in 2001 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to redeem exchange or repurchase up to an aggregate of 990 million principal amount of debt securities the company had credit commitments in the form of revolving credit facilities revolvers as of december 31 2003 the revolvers are comprised of agreements for 600 million 400 million and canadian 390 million us 300 million the 600 million revolver expires in december 2006 and the 400 million and canadian 390 million revolvers expire in december 2004 unless renewed by mutual consent the company has the option to convert any remaining balances on the 400 million and canadian 390 million revolvers to oneyear and fiveyear plus one day term notes respectively under the covenants of the revolvers company debt cannot exceed 60 percent of capitalization as defined in the agreements the revolvers are available to cover debt due within one year therefore commercial paper if any credit facility notes and fixedrate debt due within one year are generally classified as longterm debt at december 31 2003 there were no amounts outstanding under the revolvers and no outstanding commercial paper 

17 net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased 990 million and 433 million over 2002 and 2001 respectively primarily due to higher commodity prices key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average natural gas prices increased 51 percent and 20 percent over 2002 and 2001 respectively while ngls prices increased 41 percent and 22 percent over the same period production volumes were essentially flat to 2002 but up 8 percent over 2001 while the company believes that 2004 production will exceed 2003 levels the company is unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities see page 17 for a discussion of commodity prices generally producing natural gas and crude oil reservoirs have declining production rates production rates are impacted by numerous factors including but not limited to geological geophysical and engineering matters production curtailments and restrictions weather market demands and the company’s ability to replace depleting reserves the company’s inability to adequately replace reserves could result in a decline in production volumes one of the key drivers of generating net operating cash flows the company’s reserve replacement ratio for the year ended december 31 2003 was 142 percent and has averaged 187 percent over the last three years results for any year are a function of the success of the company’s drilling program and acquisitions while program results are difficult to predict the company’s current drilling inventory provides the company opportunities to replace its production in 2004 the company has various commitments primarily related to leases for office space other property and equipment and demand charges on firm transportation agreements for its production of natural gas and crude oil the company expects to fund these commitments with cash generated from operations the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2003   the company also has liabilities of 28 million related to postretirement benefits on its consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2003 due to the nature of these benefits the company cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made for these benefits see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of postretirement benefits certain of the company’s contracts require the posting of collateral upon request in the event that the company’s longterm debt is rated below investment grade or ceases to be rated those contracts primarily consist of hedging agreements two longterm natural gas transportation agreements and a natural gas purchase agreement a few of the hedging agreements also require posting of collateral if the market value of the transactions thereunder exceed a specified dollar threshold that varies with the company’s credit rating while the marktomarket positions under the hedging agreements and the natural gas purchase agreement will fluctuate with commodity prices as a producer the company’s liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative instruments tends to increase when commodity prices increase consequently the company is most likely to have its largest unfavorable marktomarket position in a high commodity price environment when it is least likely that a credit support requirement due to an adverse rating action would occur at december 31 2003 the aggregate unfavorable marktomarket position under the aforementioned hedging agreements was approximately 13 million a rating change would have had no impact on the company related to the natural gas purchase agreement since the marktomarket position under such agreement was favorable to the company in the case of the canadian transportation agreements the collateral required would be an amount equal to 12 months of estimated demand charges that amount totaled approximately 31 million as of december 31 2003 

18 in the normal course of business the company has performance obligations which are supported by surety bonds or letters of credit these obligations are primarily for site restoration and dismantlement royalty payment appeals and exploration and development programs where governmental organizations require such support 

changes in credit rating also impact the cost of borrowing under the company’s revolvers but have no impact on availability of credit under the agreements the revolvers are filed as exhibits 1017 1018 and 1028 to this form 10k 

in december 2000 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of the company’s common stock through april 30 2003 the company had repurchased 816 million of its common stock under the program authorized in december 2000 in april 2003 the company’s board of directors voted to restore the authorization level to 1 billion effective may 1 2003 

during 2003 the company repurchased approximately 7 million shares of its common stock for approximately 361 million and as of december 31 2003 had authority to repurchase an additional 762 million of its common stock under the current authorization as of december 31 2003 5 million of the share repurchases were not cash settled during the period since december 2000 the company has repurchased approximately 24 million shares or 1 billion of its common stock 

the company has certain other commitments and uncertainties related to its normal operations management believes that there are no other commitments or uncertainties that will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company offbalance sheet arrangements the company has offbalance sheet arrangements that it believes have not and are not reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors the company has investments in two entities that it accounts for under the equity method the book values of the company’s interests in lost creek gathering company llc lost creek and evangeline gas pipeline company evangeline are 16 million and 2 million respectively as of december 31 2003 lost creek had outstanding debt totaling 48 million and evangeline had outstanding debt totaling 38 million lost creek and evangeline’s debts are nonrecourse to the company and as a result the company has no legal responsibility or obligation for these debts management believes that lost creek and evangeline are financially stable and therefore will be in a position to repay their outstanding debts capital expenditures and resources capital expenditures were as follow capital expenditures variances  the company’s consolidated capital expenditures were down 3 percent and 48 percent compared to 2002 and 2001 respectively year 2001 includes the hunter acquisition the company utilizes a disciplined approach to capital spending excluding acquisitions the company’s capital spending related to internal development and exploration is up 36 and 25 percent compared to 2002 and 2001 respectively however at the current capital spending levels the company believes that spending is sufficient to add adequate reserves and achieve the target of three to eight percent 

19 average annual production growth capital expenditures in 2004 excluding proved property acquisitions are expected to be approximately 15 billion essentially the same as 2003 capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be primarily for internal development and exploration of oil and gas properties capital spending in 2004 related to internal development and exploration is expected to be about 3 percent higher than 2003 capital expenditures are expected to be funded from internally generated cash flows 

in october 2001 the company announced its intent to sell certain noncore nonstrategic properties in order to improve the overall quality of its asset portfolio primarily in the us during 2002 the company completed the sale of the val verde plant val verde and certain noncore nonstrategic properties that consisted of high cost structure high production volume decline rates and limited growth opportunities as a result of these property sales the company generated proceeds before post closing adjustments of approximately 12 billion and recognized a net pretax gain of 68 million the producing properties that were sold during 2002 contributed approximately 230 mmcfe and 458 mmcfe per day during the years 2002 and 2001 respectively the company used a portion of the proceeds generated from property sales to retire debt and for general corporate purposes marketing north america us and canada the company’s marketing strategy is to maximize the value of its production by developing marketing flexibility from the wellhead to its ultimate sale the company’s natural gas production is gathered processed exchanged and transported utilizing various firm and interruptible contracts and routes to access higher value market hubs the company’s customers include local distribution companies electric utilities industrial users and marketers the company maintains the capacity to ensure its production can be marketed either at the wellhead or downstream at market sensitive prices 

all of the company’s crude oil production is sold to third parties at the wellhead or transported to market hubs where it is sold or exchanged ngls are typically sold at field plants or transported to market hubs and sold to third parties downgrades or the inability of the company’s customers to maintain their credit rating or credit worthiness could result in an increase in the allowance for unrecoverable receivables from natural gas ngls or crude oil revenues or it could result in a change in the company’s assumption process of evaluating collectibility based on situations regarding specific customers and applicable economic conditions other international the company’s other international production is marketed to third parties either directly by the company or by the operators of the properties production is sold at the platforms or local sales points based on spot or contract prices qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk substantially all of the company’s natural gas ngls and crude oil production is sold on the spot market or under shortterm contracts at market sensitive prices spot market prices for domestic natural gas and crude oil are subject to volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures market including among others the new york mercantile exchange nymex quality differentials worldwide political developments and the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries also affect crude oil prices 

there is also a difference between the nymex futures contract price for a particular month and the actual cash price received for that month in a north america producing basin or at a north america market hub which is referred to as the “basis differential” basis differentials can vary widely depending on various factors including but not limited to local supply and demand 

on january 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities it requires enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value the requisite accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 

the company utilizes overthecounter price and basis swaps as well as options to hedge its production in order to decrease its price risk exposure the gains and losses realized as a result of these price and basis derivative transactions are substantially offset when the hedged commodity is delivered in order to accommodate the needs of its customers the company also uses price swaps to convert natural gas sold under fixedprice contracts to market sensitive prices 

the company uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of natural gas and crude oil may have on the fair value of the company’s derivative instruments for example at 

20 december 31 2003 the potential decrease in fair value of derivative instruments assuming a 10 percent adverse movement an increase in the underlying commodities prices would result in a 35 million decrease in the net unrealized gain the derivative instruments in place at december 31 2003 hedged approximately 13 percent of the company’s expected natural gas production volumes through 2004 

for purposes of calculating the hypothetical change in fair value the relevant variables include the type of commodity the commodity futures prices the volatility of commodity prices and the basis and quality differentials the hypothetical change in fair value is calculated by multiplying the difference between the hypothetical price adjusted for any basis or quality differentials and the contractual price by the contractual volumes as more fully described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company periodically assesses the effectiveness of its derivative instruments in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the risks being hedged changes in basis differentials or notional amounts of the hedged transactions could cause the derivative instruments to fail the effectiveness test and result in the marktomarket accounting for the affected derivative transactions which would be reflected in the company’s current period earnings credit and market risks the company manages and controls market and counterparty credit risk through established formal internal control procedures which are reviewed on an ongoing basis the company attempts to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies and monitoring procedures in the normal course of business collateral is not required for financial instruments with credit risk foreign currency risk the company’s reported cash flows related to its canadian operating subsidiaries are based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars and converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian to us dollar exchange rates for the period reported the company’s canadian operating subsidiaries have no financial obligations that are denominated in us dollars dividends on january 21 2004 the board of directors board declared a common stock quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share payable april 9 2004 to shareholders of record on march 10 2004 dividend levels are determined by the board based on profitability capital expenditures financing and other factors the company declared and paid cash dividends on common stock totaling approximately 115 million and 85 million respectively during 2003 on january 21 2004 the company’s board also announced a 2for1 split split on the company’s common stock in the form of a share distribution payable on june 1 2004 to shareholders of record on may 5 2004 the split is subject to shareholder approval of an amendment to the company’s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the company’s common stock from 325 million to 650 million application of critical accounting policies oil and gas reserves the company’s estimate of proved reserves reflects quantities of natural gas crude oil and ngls which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions the process of estimating quantities of natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological geophysical engineering and economic data including production data reservoir pressure data and data collected as a result of development or exploration drilling economic and operating conditions such as product prices operating costs development costs production tax rates and actions of domestic or foreign governments influence the estimation of reserves any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the company’s reserves the company has policies and procedures through which the required engineering geological and economic data is gathered and proved reserves are estimated experienced and qualified company engineers perform and oversee reserve estimates additionally more than 80 percent of the company’s reserve estimates during 2001 2002 and 2003 were subjected to external review by independent oil and gas consultants who in their judgement determined the estimates to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information see independent oil and gas consultants letters on page 63 despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates the company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements as described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company uses the unitofproduction method to amortize its oil and gas properties changes in reserve quantities as described above will 

21 cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision or in some cases an impairment charge in the period of the revision see the supplementary financial information for reserve data 

successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting for its exploration and development activities acquisition and development costs are capitalized and amortized using the unitofproduction method based on proved and proved developed reserves estimated by the company’s reserve engineers changes in reserve quantities as described below will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision unsuccessful exploration or dry hole wells are expensed in the period in which the wells are determined to be dry and could have a significant effect on results of operations 

carrying value of longlived assets as more fully described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company performs an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management’s estimates of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves future natural gas ngls and crude oil prices and costs to extract these reserves downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates or depressed natural gas ngls and crude oil prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying amounts of its properties see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for impairment of oil and gas properties 

costs attributable to the company’s unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization on a composite basis based on past experience and average property lives as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of the company’s future exploration program 

asset retirement obligations aro the company has significant obligations to plug and abandon natural gas and crude oil wells and related equipment as well as to dismantle and abandon plants at the end of oil and gas production operations the company records the fair value of a liability for an aro in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset subsequently the asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method in addition increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as additional depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of income 

estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing existence of a liability as well as what constitutes adequate restoration the company uses the present value of estimated cash flows related to its aro to determine the fair value inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs inflation factors credit adjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset 

goodwill as described in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 142 requires an annual impairment assessment in lieu of periodic amortization the impairment assessment requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned the company determined the fair value of its canadian reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach the company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of expected future cash flows under the market approach the company estimated the fair value based on market multiples of reserves and production for comparable companies 

the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and costs proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves appropriate discount rates and other variables downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit continued weakening of the us dollar change in capital structure or depressed natural gas ngls and crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill 

22 in future periods in the market approach the company makes certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums although the company based its fair value estimate on assumptions it believes to be reasonable those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain 

revenue recognition natural gas ngls and crude oil revenues are recorded using the entitlement method under the entitlement method revenue is recorded when title passes based on the company’s net interest the company records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices the sales prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil are adjusted for transportation costs and other related deductions the transportation costs and other deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment subsequently these deductions and transportation costs are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents historically these adjustments have been insignificant since there is a ready market for natural gas crude oil and ngls the company sells the majority of its products soon after production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 

legal environmental and other contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 a provision for legal environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management in many cases management’s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators andor courts of law the experience of the company and other companies in dealing with similar matters and the decision of management on how it intends to respond to a particular contingency for example a decision to contest a matter vigorously or a decision to seek a negotiated settlement the company’s management closely monitors known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 

other sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets were issued in june 2001 and became effective for the company july 1 2001 and january 1 2002 respectively sfas no 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method additionally sfas no 141 requires companies to disaggregate and report certain intangibles assets separately from goodwill sfas no 142 establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 142 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but rather are reviewed annually for impairment one interpretation being considered relative to these standards is that oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds should be classified separately from oil and gas properties and included as intangible assets on the company’s consolidated balance sheets in addition the disclosures required by sfas no 141 and no 142 related to intangibles would be included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements historically the company like many other oil and gas companies has included oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract reserves as part of the oil and gas properties even after sfas no 141 and no 142 became effective 

this interpretation of sfas no 141 and no 142 would only affect the company’s consolidated balance sheet classification of oil and gas leaseholds the company’s results of operations and cash flows would not be affected since these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract reserves would continue to be amortized in accordance with accounting rules for oil and gas companies provided in sfas no 19 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  

at december 31 2003 the company had undeveloped and developed leaseholds of approximately 13 billion and 24 billion that would have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and intangible developed leaseholds respectively if it had applied the interpretation currently being discussed the company will continue to classify its oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 

results of operations year ended december 31 2003 compared with year ended december 31 2002 the company’s consolidated net income increased 747 million or 375 diluted earnings per common share in 2003 primarily due to higher commodity prices net income in 2003 included a tax benefit of 214 million or 107 diluted earnings per common share related to the reduction of the canadian federal income tax and the alberta provincial corporate income tax rates net income in 2002 included a tax benefit of 26 million or 013 diluted earnings per common share related to the reduction of the alberta provincial corporate income tax rate in canada and the reversal of a tax valuation reserve of 27 million or 013 diluted earnings per common share related to the sale of assets in the united kingdom uk sector of the north sea below is a discussion of prices volumes and revenue variances price and volume variances  revenue variances  revenues the company’s consolidated revenues increased 1343 million in 2003 higher revenues were primarily due to higher commodity prices resulting in increased revenues of 1322 million revenues also increased 26 million due to higher processing and other revenues processing and other revenues increased 20 million and 19 million respectively due to ineffectiveness on cashflow and fairvalue hedges and changes in fair value instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting the amounts were partially offset by a decrease of 18 million related to lower sales volumes and 19 million related to the sale of val verde in june 2002 the revenue variances related to commodity prices and sales volumes are described below 

price variances commodity prices are one of the key drivers of earnings and net operating cash flow generation higher commodity prices contributed 1322 million to the increase in revenues in 2003 average natural gas prices including a 009 realized loss per mcf related to hedging activities increased 163 per mcf in 2003 resulting in increased revenues of 1129 million average ngls prices increased 594 per barrel in 2003 resulting in higher revenues of 140 million average crude oil prices including a 009 realized loss per barrel related to hedging activities increased 311 per barrel in 2003 resulting in increased revenues of 53 million see page 17 for a discussion of commodity prices 

volume variances sales volumes are another key driver that impact the company’s earnings and net operating cash flow generation lower sales volumes in 2003 resulted in a decline in revenues of 18 million average crude oil sales volumes decreased 26 mbbls per day in 2003 reducing revenues 23 million average crude oil sales volumes decreased 138 mbbls per day primarily due to asset sales in 2002 in the gulf of mexico canada the uk sector of the north sea and the williston basin this decrease in crude oil sales volumes was partially offset by an increase of 108 mbbls per day resulting from higher production at ourhoud field and the companyoperated mln field in algeria south louisiana and cedar creek average natural gas sales volumes decreased 17 mmcf per day in 2003 resulting in decreased revenues of 20 million average natural gas sales volumes decreased 108 mmcf per day primarily due to asset sales in 2002 in the gulf of mexico the uk sector of the north sea and sonora this decrease in natural gas sales volumes was partially offset by an increase of 93 mmcf per day primarily as a result of the drilling programs in canada and the fort worth basin average ngls sales volumes increased 47 mbbls per day in 2003 resulting in higher revenues of 25 million year over year average ngls sales volumes increased 48 mbbls per day in the san juan basin and the fort worth basin 

below is a discussion of total costs and other income—net total costs and other income—net  total costs and other income— net increased 342 million in 2003 this increase in total costs and other income— net was primarily due to items discussed below the increase in the exchange rate in canada during 2003 impacted certain costs and expenses for the company changes in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar could impact costs and expenses in future years however at this time the company cannot predict what impact the canadian exchange rate will have on costs and expenses in the future 

dda expense increased 94 million primarily due to higher unitofproduction rates on the canadian properties which have higher rates than average unitofproduction rates for the company partially offset by the divestiture of higher cost properties in 2002 and lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes taxes other than income taxes increased 64 million primarily due to higher production taxes resulting from higher crude oil and natural gas revenues 

the company performs an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management’s estimates of natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves future natural gas ngls and crude oil prices and costs to extract these reserves in 2003 the company recorded charges of 63 million related to the impairment of oil 

25 and gas properties due to performance related downward reserve adjustments associated with certain properties primarily in canada 

gain on disposal of assets decreased 60 million primarily due to the divestiture program that was announced by the company in late 2001 and completed in late 2002 transportation expense increased 54 million primarily due to higher contract rates primarily resulting from the sale of val verde in 2002 other expense— net increased 44 million primarily due to lower interest income and higher expenses related to foreign currency transactions 

exploration costs decreased 34 million primarily due to lower drilling rig expenses of 32 million attributable to a loss incurred by the company in 2002 related to the remaining terms of a sublease of a deepwater drilling rig and 19 million due to lower geological and geophysical gg and other expenses these decreases were partially offset by higher exploratory dry hole costs of 15 million and higher amortization of undeveloped lease costs of 2 million 

income tax expense income tax expense increased 195 million in 2003 the increase in tax expense was primarily due to higher pretax income of 1001 million in november 2003 the government of canada passed bill c48 which reduced the canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the natural resource sector from 28 percent to 21 percent over five years beginning in 2003 as a result in 2003 the company recorded a benefit of 203 million related to the reduction in the canadian federal income tax rate the company also recorded a net tax benefit of 27 million in 2003 related to the successful appeal of the 19961998 irs tax audit additionally the company recorded higher tax benefits of 11 million in 2003 related to interest deductions allowed in both the us and canada on transactions associated with crossborder financing in 2003 the company resolved all disputes under tax sharing agreements with certain former affiliates as a result during 2003 the company recorded a 3 million decrease in income tax expense the company recorded lower tax benefits of 15 million related to the reduction in the alberta provincial corporate income tax rate in canada year 2002 included a tax benefit associated with the reversal of a tax valuation allowance of 27 million related to the sale of assets in the uk sector of the north sea 

year ended december 31 2002 compared with year ended december 31 2001 the company’s consolidated net income decreased 107 million or 045 diluted earnings per common share in 2002 primarily as a result of lower commodity prices partially offset by higher commodity sales volumes net income also included a benefit of 27 million or 013 diluted earnings per common share as a result of the reversal of a tax valuation reserve related to the sale of assets in the uk sector of the north sea and a tax benefit of 26 million or 013 diluted earnings per common share related to the reduction of the alberta corporate income tax rate in canada below is a discussion of prices volumes and revenue variances price and volume variances  

26 revenue variances  revenues the company’s consolidated revenues decreased 451 million in 2002 lower revenues were primarily driven by reduced commodity prices resulting in reduced revenues of 619 million processing and other revenues which represented less than one percent of the company’s total revenues in 2002 declined 70 million this decline was primarily due to a reduction in revenues of 31 million and 20 million respectively related to ineffectiveness on cashflow and fairvalue hedges and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting processing and other revenues also declined 22 million due to the sale of val verde in the second quarter of 2002 these amounts were partially offset by an increase of 241 million related to higher sales volumes revenue variances related to commodity prices and sales volumes are described below price variances lower commodity prices resulted in reduced revenues of 619 million in 2002 average natural gas prices including a 016 realized gain per mcf related to hedging activities decreased 083 per mcf resulting in lower revenues of 580 million lower average natural gas prices were impacted by location basis differentials that varied widely compared to the same period in 2001 primarily in the western us and western canada average ngls prices declined 233 per barrel while average crude oil prices including an 018 realized gain per barrel related to hedging activities increased 066 per barrel in 2002 the decline in ngls prices reduced revenues 51 million while the increase in crude oil prices increased revenues 12 million in 2002 volume variances higher sales volumes resulted in increased revenues of 241 million in 2002 average natural gas sales volumes increased 192 mmcf per day resulting in higher revenues of 282 million in canada average natural gas sales volumes increased 369 mmcf per day primarily due to the acquisitions of canadian hunter exploration ltd hunter in late 2001 and atco in early 2002 and its drilling program the increase in natural gas sales volumes was partially offset by reductions of 172 mmcf per day resulting from natural declines in production and asset sales in the onshore gulf coast the gulf of mexico shelf the san juan basin and the permian basin average ngls sales volumes increased 130 mbbls per day resulting in increased revenues of 80 million in 2002 average ngls sales volumes increased 149 mbbls per day also primarily due to the acquisition of hunter average crude oil sales volumes decreased 141 mbbls per day resulting in reduced revenues of 121 million in 2002 average crude oil sales volumes decreased 124 mbbls per day primarily due to natural declines in production and asset sales in the gulf of mexico shelf canada and the permian basin 

27 below is a discussion of total costs and other income – net total costs and other income–net  total costs and other income— net decreased 113 million in 2002 the decrease included a 184 million charge related to the impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale and a restructuring charge of 10 million related to severance and other exit costs recorded in 2001 dda increased 98 million in 2002 primarily due to a higher unitofproduction rate related to changes in production resulting from the canadian acquisitions which had higher rates than the average unitofproduction rates for the company dda also increased due to higher natural gas production volumes primarily in canada interest expense increased 84 million primarily due to higher debt balances during 2002 resulting from the hunter acquisition in late 2001 and other property acquisitions consummated in early 2002 exploration costs increased 28 million in 2002 primarily due to higher amortization of undeveloped lease costs of 54 million higher drilling rig costs of 17 million and higher gg and other expenses of 20 million partially offset by lower exploratory dry hole costs of 63 million the higher drilling rig expenses which were approximately 40 million during 2002 were attributable to the subletting of a deepwater drilling rig under lease to the company this 40 million charge covered the anticipated loss for the remaining term of the lease transportation expense increased 17 million primarily due to higher contract rates and administrative expenses increased 12 million primarily due to higher payroll and benefits gain on disposal of assets increased 60 million due to the divestiture of val verde and noncore nonstrategic properties in 2002 taxes other than income taxes decreased 43 million primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas revenues and production and processing expenses decreased 38 million including the 10 million restructuring charge recorded in 2001 primarily due to lower well operating costs other income— net increased 27 million primarily due to higher interest income lower foreign currency transaction losses and lower miscellaneous expenses incurred in 2002 income tax expense income tax expense decreased 234 million in 2002 the decrease in tax expense was primarily due to lower pretax income of 338 million in 2002 the company recorded a benefit of 27 million associated with the reversal of a tax valuation allowance related to the sale of assets in the uk sector of the north sea during 2002 the company recorded higher tax benefits of 86 million related to interest deductions allowed in both the us and canada on transactions associated with crossborder financing the company also recorded higher tax benefits of 23 million as a result of a reduction in the alberta provincial corporate income tax rate in canada these benefit increases were partially offset by lower net section 29 tax credits of 23 million and higher tax expense of 12 million related to an increase in the uk’s income tax rate legal proceedings the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims act these lawsuits were consolidated during 1999 and 2000 for pretrial 

28 proceedings by the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in the matter of in re natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united states district court for the district of wyoming mdl1293 the plaintiffs contend that defendants underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on federal and indian lands through the use of belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies during the period of 1985 to the present plaintiffs allege that the royalties paid by defendants were lower than the royalties required to be paid under federal regulations and that the forms filed by defendants with the minerals management service mms reporting these royalty payments were false thereby violating the civil false claims act the united states has intervened in certain of the mdl1293 cases as to some of the defendants including the company the plaintiffs and the intervenor have not specified in their pleadings the amount of damages they seek from the company on december 5 2003 the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation entered an order transferring the cases alleging claims of belowmarket prices improper deductions and transactions with affiliated companies for further pretrial proceedings and trial in wright v agip  503cv264 united states district court for the eastern district of texas texarkana division the cases alleging improper measurement techniques remain pending in mdl1293 

various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the united states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of natural gas produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general these proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the company’s royalty payments over various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant federal regulations most of these proceedings involve production volumes and royalties that are the subject of natural gas royalties qui tam litigation based on the company’s present understanding of the various governmental and civil false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such defenses the company is also exploring the possibility of a settlement of these claims although there has been no formal demand for damages the company currently estimates based on its communications with the intervenor that the amount of underpaid royalties on onshore production claimed by the intervenor in these proceedings is approximately 68 million in the event that the company is found to have violated the civil false claims act the company could also be subject to double damages civil monetary penalties and other sanctions including a temporary suspension from bidding on and entering into future federal mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time the company has established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to provide for this potential liability based upon its evaluation of this matter the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no 98854 filed in 1995 in the district court in the hague and currently pending in the court of appeal in the hague the netherlands plaintiffs who are working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that the company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger field in the l16a block unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly enriched by producing part of the oil from the adjoining q1 block the plaintiffs claim that the defendants infringed upon plaintiffs’ right to produce the minerals present in its license area and acted in violation of generally accepted standards by failing to inform plaintiffs of the overlap of the logger field into the q1 block plaintiffs seek damages of 975 million as of january 1 1997 plus interest for all relevant periods the company owned a 375 percent working interest in the logger field following a trial the district court in the hague rendered a judgment in favor of the defendants including the company dismissing all claims plaintiffs thereafter appealed on october 19 2000 the court of appeal in the hague issued an interim judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that additional evidence be presented to the court relating to issues of both liability and damages after receiving additional evidence from the parties the court of appeals subsequently issued a ruling in favor of defendants in an interim judgment issued on december 18 2003 the court of appeals found that defendants should not have assumed that they were extracting oil from the q1 block that unocal was not entitled to compensation for any production occurring prior to 1992 and that damages if any would be limited to the proceeds unocal would have received for oil extracted from the q1 block less the costs unocal would have incurred to produce the oil from an existing well in the l16a block the court of appeals ordered that further evidence be presented to a court appointed expert to determine whether any damages had been suffered by unocal the company and the other defendants are continuing to present evidence to the court and vigorously assert defenses against these claims the company has also asserted claims of indemnity against two of the defendants from whom it had acquired a portion of its working interest share if the company is successful in enforcing the indemnities its working interest share of any adverse judgment could be reduced to 15 percent for some of the periods covered by plaintiffs’ lawsuit the company currently does not believe that an unfavorable outcome is probable nor in the event of an unfavorable outcome is the company reasonably able to estimate the possible loss if any or range of loss in this lawsuit accordingly there has been no reserve established for this matter the company and its former affiliate el paso natural gas company have also been named as defendants in two class action lawsuits styled bank of america et al v el paso natural gas company et al  case no cj9768 and deane w moore et al v burlington northern inc et al  case no cj97132 each filed in 1997 in the district court of washita county state of oklahoma and subsequently consolidated by the court plaintiffs contend that defendants underpaid royalties from 1983 to the present on natural gas produced from specified wells in oklahoma through the use of below 

29 market prices improper deductions and transactions with affiliated companies and in other instances failed to pay or delayed in the payment of royalties on certain gas sold from these wells the plaintiffs seek an accounting and damages for alleged royalty underpayments plus interest from the time such amounts were allegedly due plaintiffs additionally seek the recovery of punitive damages the plaintiffs have not specified in their pleadings the amount of damages they seek from the company however through pretrial discovery plaintiffs have provided defendants with alternative theories of recovery claiming monetary damages of up to 2636 million in principal plus interest punitive damages and attorney’s fees the company believes it has substantial defenses to these claims and is vigorously asserting such defenses the company and el paso natural gas company have asserted contractual claims for indemnity against each other the court has certified the plaintiff classes of royalty and overriding royalty interest owners and the parties are proceeding with pretrial discovery it is anticipated that this matter will be scheduled for trial during 2004 the company currently does not believe that an unfavorable outcome is probable nor in the event of an unfavorable outcome is the company reasonably able to estimate the possible loss if any or range of loss in these lawsuits accordingly there has been no reserve established for this matter 

in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including claims for personal injury and property damage claims challenging oil and gas royalty ad valorem and severance tax payments claims related to joint interest billings under oil and gas operating agreements claims alleging mismeasurement of volumes and wrongful analysis of heating content of natural gas and other claims in the nature of contract regulatory or employment disputes none of the governmental proceedings involve foreign governments the company has established reserves for certain legal proceedings which are included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that the company could incur additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established of up to approximately 25 million to 30 million in excess of the amounts currently accrued future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and the amounts accrued while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these legal proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company although cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved other matters recent accounting pronouncements on december 23 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 revised 2003 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106 this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fasb statements no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions no 88 employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions the new rules require additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the new disclosures are effective for 2003 calendar yearend financial statements the company has adopted the revised disclosures as of december 31 2003 see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 sfas no 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances many of those instruments were previously classified as equity sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas no 150 and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption restatement is not permitted the adoption of sfas no 150 during 2003 did not impact the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 amendment of statement no 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 149 sfas no 149 improves financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly in particular sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component amends the definition of an “underlying” to conform it to language used in fin no 45 and

safe harbor cautionary disclosure on forwardlooking statements the company in discussions of its future plans expectations objectives and anticipated performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the sec or documents incorporated by reference therein may include projections or other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended forwardlooking statements can be identified by the words “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “believes” “should” and similar expressions projections and forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions which the company believes are reasonable but are by their nature inherently uncertain in all cases there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove correct or that projected events will occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ from any such projections or other forwardlooking statements follow commodity prices —changes in natural gas ngls and crude oil prices including basis differentials from those assumed in preparing projections and forwardlooking statements could cause the company’s actual financial results to differ materially from projected financial results and could also impact the company’s determination of proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relative to natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves in addition periods of sharply lower commodity prices could affect the company’s production levels andor cause it to curtail capital spending projects and delay or defer exploration exploitation or development projects projections relating to the price received by the company for natural gas and ngls also rely on assumptions regarding the availability and pricing of transportation to the company’s key markets in particular the company has contractual arrangements for the transportation of natural gas from the san juan basin eastward to eastern and midwestern markets or to market hubs in texas oklahoma and louisiana the natural gas price received by the company could be adversely affected by any constraints in pipeline capacity to serve these markets these and other commodity price risks that could cause actual results to differ from projections and forwardlooking statements are further described in part ii “commodity risk” exploration and production risk —the company’s business is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and development and production of natural gas ngls and crude oil including uncertainties as the presence size and recoverability of hydrocarbons the exploration for natural gas and crude oil is a highrisk business in which significant numbers of dry holes and high associated costs can be incurred in the process of seeking commercial discoveries the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and requires making subjective engineering geological geophysical and economic assumptions in this regard changes in the economic conditions including commodity prices or operating conditions including without limitation exploration development and production costs and expenses and drilling results from exploration and development activity could cause the company’s estimated proved reserves or production to differ from those included in any such forwardlooking statements or projections reserves which require the use of improved recovery techniques for production are included in proved reserves if supported by a suitable analogy a successful pilot project or the operation of an installed program projecting future natural gas ngls and crude oil production is imprecise producing oil and gas reservoirs eventually have declining production rates projections of production rates rely on certain assumptions regarding historical production patterns in the area or formation tests for a particular producing horizon actual production rates could differ materially from such projections production rates depend on a number of additional factors including commodity prices market demand and the political economic and regulatory climate another major factor affecting the company’s production is its ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through acquisition exploration or development programs exploration success is extremely difficult to predict with certainty particularly over the short term where the timing and extent of successful results vary widely over the long term the ability to replace reserves depends not only on the company’s ability to locate crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves but on the cost of finding and developing such reserves moreover development of any particular exploration or development project may not be justified because of the commodity price environment at the time or because of the company’s finding and development costs for such project no assurances can be given as to the level or timing of success that the company will be able to achieve in acquiring or finding and developing additional reserves projections relating to the company’s production and financial results rely on certain assumptions about the company’s continued success in its acquisition and asset rationalization programs and in its cost management efforts 

31 the company’s drilling operations are subject to various hazards common to the oil and gas industry including weather conditions explosions fires and blowouts which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells or formations production facilities and other property and injury to people they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions development risk —a significant portion of the company’s development plans involve large projects in canada algeria the east irish sea china ecuador wyoming north dakota and other areas a variety of factors affect the timing and outcome of such projects including without limitation approval by the other parties owning working interests in the project receipt of necessary permits and approvals by applicable governmental agencies access to surface locations and facilities opposition by nongovernment organizations and local indigenous communities the availability costs and performance of the necessary drilling equipment and infrastructure drilling risks operating hazards unexpected cost increases and technical difficulties in constructing modifying and operating equipment plants and facilities delivery schedules for critical equipment and arrangements for the gathering and transportation of the produced hydrocarbons foreign operations risk —the company’s operations outside of the us are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations including without limitation the loss of revenue property and equipment from hazards such as expropriation nationalization war insurrection acts of terrorism and other political risks increases in taxes and governmental royalties renegotiation or abrogation of contracts with governmental entities changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased companies currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations world economic cycles restrictions or quotas on production and commodity sales limited market access and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company’s international operations laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect the company’s international operations the company’s ability to market natural gas ngls and crude oil discovered or produced in its foreign operations and the price the company could obtain for such production depends on many factors beyond the company’s control including ready markets for natural gas ngls and crude oil the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities fluctuating demand for crude oil and natural gas the availability and cost of competing fuels and the effects of foreign governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales pipeline and processing facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and therefore any actual sales of the company’s production could be delayed for extended periods of time until such facilities are constructed competition —the company actively competes for property acquisitions exploration leases and sales of natural gas ngls and crude oil frequently against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources in its marketing activities the company competes with numerous companies for gas purchasing and processing contracts and for natural gas and ngls at several stages in the distribution chain competitive factors in the company’s business include price contract terms quality of service pipeline access transportation discounts and distribution efficiencies legal and regulatory risk —the company’s operations are affected by foreign national state and local laws and regulations restrictions on production price or gathering rate controls changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies and other changes in or litigation arising under laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could have a significant effect on the company’s operations or financial results the company’s operations in some geographic areas may be negatively impacted by legal proceedings the actions of national state and local governments and the actions of nongovernmental organizations that delay restrict or prevent the company’s access to surface locations for natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities the company’s operations also may be negatively impacted by laws regulations and legal proceedings pertaining to the valuation and measurement of natural gas crude oil and ngls and payment of royalties from such sales existing litigation involving the valuation and measurement of natural gas crude oil and ngls and payment of

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

br is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in
north america the company explores for develops and produces natural gas ngls
and crude oil primarily from its properties located in the rocky mountain
natural gas fairway of north america complemented by several key international
projects the companys north american activities are concentrated in areas with
known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to large multiwell
repeatable drilling programs and the companys technical skills
internationally the company is focused on the startup and delivery of several
key projects

the company has adopted a very disciplined capital allocation process with the
objective of achieving modest volumetric growth in the range of three to eight
percent as a longterm annual average coupled with strong financial returns

in managing its business br must deal with numerous risks and uncertainties
these risks and uncertainties can be broadly categorized as subsurface which
includes the presence size and recoverability of hydrocarbons regulatory
which includes access and permitting necessary to conduct its operations
operational which includes logistical timing and infrastructure issues
especially internationally which is often beyond the companys control and
commercial which includes commodity price volatility local price
differentials in its various areas of operations and attention to operating
margins each of these factors is complex challenging and highly variable

to address subsurface risks br utilizes most of the latest technological tools
available to assess and mitigate these risks these tools include but are not
limited to modern geophysical data and interpretation software petrophysical
information physical core data production histories paleontology data and
satellite imagery in spite of these technologies the multitude of unknown
variables that exist below the surface of the earth make it difficult to
consistently

                                        14
page

and accurately predict drilling results the company has put considerable
emphasis in recent years on creating an asset portfolio that improves the
reliability of those predictions however these types of operations tend to
exploit or develop smaller quantities of hydrocarbon reserves and as a result
the company must develop more of these opportunities in order to maintain
production similarly the company has reduced its focus on areas where there is
far less analytical data available and drilling outcomes are less predictable
such as wildcat exploration operations in sparsely explored areas br is
constantly assessing its drilling opportunities to achieve balance in its
drilling program for risk and financial returns in order to make this possible
the company attempts to maintain a large inventory of drillable projects from
which its technical and management teams can select a drilling program in any
given period

on regulatory and operational matters the company actively manages its
exploration and production activities br values sound stewardship and strong
relationships with all stakeholders in conducting its business the company
attempts to stay abreast of emerging issues to effectively anticipate and manage
potential impacts to the companys operations

at br managing the commercial risks is an ongoing priority considerable
analysis of historical price trends supply statistics demand projections and
infrastructure constraints form the basis of the companys outlook for the
commodity prices it may receive for its future production because much of this
data is very dynamic the companys view and the markets view of future
commodity pricing can change rapidly based on the companys ongoing assessment
of the underlying data and the markets br will from time to time use various
financial tools to hedge the price it will receive for a particular commodity in
the future the primary purpose of these activities is to provide for adequate
financial returns on the significant investments that the company makes annually
to replenish its productive base and grow its reserves while leaving as much
commodity price upside as possible for the companys stockholders margin
enhancement is another important element in brs business including attention
to cash operating and administrative costs and marketing activities such as
securing transportation to alternative market hubs to protect against weak
producingarea prices the company may also enter into transportation agreements
that allow the company to sell a portion of its production in alternative
markets when local prices are weak

all of the uncertainties described above create opportunities in the exploration
and production business to the extent they drive the relative valuations of
three distinct asset classes in the business the first asset class is the
commodity itself  natural gas ngls and crude oil the prices for this asset
class are generally established by the purchasers of these commodities but
closely track the prices that are set through the public trading of futures
contracts for those same commodities the second asset class consists of the
physical oil and gas properties that may contain proved probable and possible
reserves as well as exploratory potential the value of physical assets are
usually established in a private market created by a willing seller and a
willing buyer of a given property or group of properties the third asset class
consists of the equities of the publicly traded exploration and production
companies which are valued in the public market place daily because these three
asset classes are not always valued consistently with each other opportunities
may exist from time to time to take advantage of these various valuation
differences these valuation differences are key to brs capital allocation
philosophy

at br there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete
for available capital these include drilling opportunities acquisition
opportunities and financial opportunities such as share repurchases and debt
repayment depending on circumstances and the relative valuations of the asset
classes described above br allocates capital among its investment alternatives
which is an allocation approach that is rateofreturn based its goal is to
ensure that capital is being invested in the highest return opportunities
available at any given time

much of what has been described above is conducted and handled routinely the
ability of brs management and staff to take into account all relevant factors
which fluctuate constantly will be a key determinant in the companys future
performance

outlook

the company expects full year production volumes in 2003 to average between
2573 and 2708 mmcfe per day in 2003 the company is expected to experience
some gas equivalent production decreases as a result of property sales in 2002
and natural declines however the company expects to offset these production
declines with new projects such as the lost cabin gas plant expansion in madden
field in wyoming which was completed during the third quarter of 2002 the
ourhoud field in algeria and other projects that are anticipated to startup
during 2003 such as crude oil development projects in the mln field in algeria
and the bootes and ursa offshore fields in china

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of the companys
control historically commodity prices have been volatile and the company
expects them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in
market demands overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity
constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as
a result the company cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngls and
crude oil prices and therefore it cannot determine what effect increases or
decreases in production volumes will have on future revenues

                                        15
page

in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing
sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are
critical to the companys longterm success in 2002 the company spent
approximately 12 billion on development exploration and plants and pipeline
capital and an additional 604 million on acquisitions in 2002 the companys
reserve replacement costs were 103 per mcfe excluding acquisitions or 106
per mcfe including acquisitions the company replaced 161 percent of its
worldwide production from all sources and 103 percent of its worldwide
production excluding acquisitions during 2002

on june 30 2002 the company sold the val verde gathering and processing plant
val verde plant which contributed 19 million in third party revenues in
2002 as a result of the sale in addition to the future revenue loss the
company expects its transportation expenses to increase approximately 40
million annually offset partially by lower operating expenses of approximately
11 million and lower dda of approximately 9 million the company has certain
wells that qualify for section 29 tax credits in 2002 the company generated
16 million of section 29 tax credits production from qualified wells ceased to
generate section 29 tax credits at the end of 2002

financial condition and liquidity

the companys total debt to total capital total capital is defined as total
debt and stockholders equity ratio at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001
was 51 percent and 55 percent respectively the reduction in total debt to
total capital was accomplished by the use of proceeds from the disposal of
assets and the generation of cash flows from operations based on the current
price environment the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash
from operations to fund the 2003 capital expenditures excluding potential
acquisitions at december 31 2002 the company had 443 million of cash and
cash equivalents on hand

in february 2002 burlington resources finance company brfc issued 350
million of 57 notes due march 1 2007 february notes which were fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by br the proceeds from the february notes were used
to retire commercial paper that was issued to finance the acquisition of certain
assets from atco gas and pipeline ltd atco the february notes reduced the
companys amount available under its shelf registration statement on file with
the securities and exchange commission sec to 397 million in may 2002 the
company restored its shelf registration statement to 1500 million

in june 2002 the company retired a 100 million 8 14 note to retire the
8 14 note the company issued a 104 million promissory note at a per annum
rate equal to the sum of eurodollar rates plus 070 percent the 104 million
promissory note was retired on september 16 2002 during 2002 the company also
retired 675 million of net commercial paper and had no commercial paper
outstanding at december 31 2002

in june 2002 the company commenced an offer to exchange outstanding 56 notes
due 2006 65 notes due 2011 and 74 notes due 2031 which were issued by brfc
and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by br in a private offering in
november 2001 private notes for a like principal amount of 56 notes due
2006 65 notes due 2011 and 74 notes due 2031 to be issued by brfc fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by br and registered under the securities act of
1933 as amended registered notes in july 2002 following the expiration of
the exchange offer the company issued the registered notes all of the private
notes were exchanged for registered notes and the private notes were cancelled

burlington resources capital trust i burlington resources capital trust ii
collectively the trusts br and brfc have a shelf registration statement on
file with the sec as mentioned above pursuant to such registration statement
br may issue debt securities shares of common stock or preferred stock in
addition brfc may issue debt securities and the trusts may issue trust
preferred securities net proceeds terms and pricing of offerings of securities
issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of
the offerings

brfc and the trusts are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of br and have no
independent assets or operations other than transferring funds to brs
subsidiaries any debt issued by brfc is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
br any trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are also fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by br

the company had credit commitments in the form of revolving credit facilities
revolvers as of december 31 2002 the revolvers are comprised of agreements
for 600 million 400 million and canadian 468 million us 296 million
the 600 million revolver expires in december 2006 and the 400 million and
canadian 468 million revolvers expire in december 2003 unless renewed by mutual
consent the company has the option to convert any remaining balances on the
400 million and canadian 468 million revolvers to oneyear and fiveyear plus
one day term notes respectively under the covenants of the revolvers company
debt cannot exceed 60 percent of capitalization as defined in the agreements
the revolvers are available to cover debt due within one year therefore
commercial paper credit facility notes and fixedrate debt due within one year
are generally classified as longterm debt at december 31 2002 there are no
amounts outstanding under the revolvers and no outstanding commercial paper

net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was 1549 million compared to
2106 million and 1598 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease
in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to lower net income excluding
noncash items net income was lower principally as a result of lower natural
gas and ngls prices and lower oil sales

                                        16
page

volumes partially offset by higher natural gas and ngls sales volumes the
increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to higher net income
excluding noncash items resulting primarily from higher natural gas prices and
lower working capital needs

the company has various commitments primarily related to leases for office
space other property and equipment and demand charges on firm transportation
agreements for its production of natural gas the company expects to fund these
commitments with cash generated from operations the following table summarizes
the companys contractual obligations at december 31 2002

1 see discussion of longterm debt above and note 7 of notes to consolidated
    financial statements
2 see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of
    these commitments

certain of the companys contracts require the posting of collateral upon
request in the event that the companys longterm debt is rated below investment
grade or ceases to be rated those contracts primarily consist of hedging
agreements two canadian transportation agreements and a natural gas purchase
agreement a few of the hedging agreements also require posting of collateral if
the market value of the transactions thereunder exceed a specified dollar
threshold that varies with the companys credit rating

while the marktomarket positions under the hedging agreements and the natural
gas purchase agreement will fluctuate with commodity prices as a producer the
companys liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative instruments tends
to increase when commodity prices increase consequently the company is most
likely to have its largest unfavorable marktomarket position in a high
commodity price environment when it is least likely that a credit support
requirement due to an adverse rating action would occur at december 31 2002
the aggregate unfavorable marktomarket position under the aforementioned
hedging agreements was approximately 13 million a rating change would have had
no impact on the company related to the natural gas purchase agreement since the
marktomarket position under such agreement was favorable to the company in
the case of the canadian transportation agreements the collateral required
would be an amount equal to 12 months of estimated demand charges that amount
totaled approximately 27 million as of december 31 2002

in the normal course of business the company has performance obligations which
are supported by surety bonds or letters of credit these obligations are
primarily site restoration and dismantlement royalty payments and exploration
programs where governmental organizations require such support

changes in credit rating also impact the cost of borrowing under the companys
revolvers but have no impact on availability of credit under the agreements
the revolvers are filed as exhibits 1018 1019 and 1031 to this form 10k

the company has investments in three entities that it accounts for under the
equity method the book values of the companys interests in lost creek
gathering company llc lost creek evangeline gas pipeline company
evangeline and clam petroleum bv clam are 13 million 2 million and 31
million respectively as of december 31 2002 clam had no outstanding debt
lost creek had outstanding debt totalling 52 million and evangeline had
outstanding debt totalling 43 million lost creek and evangelines debts are
nonrecourse to the company and as a result the company has no legal
responsibility or obligation for these debts management believes that lost
creek and evangeline are financially stable and therefore will be in a position
to repay their outstanding debts at december 31 2002 the company also owns a
15 percent interest in a foreign entity that is accounted for at cost the
company is the guarantor of approximately 14 million of the entitys total
outstanding debt

in december 2000 the companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of
up to 1 billion of the companys common stock during 2002 the company
repurchased none of its common stock through december 31 2002 the company has
repurchased approximately 163 million shares or 693 million of its common
stock under this 1 billion authorization

the company has certain other commitments and uncertainties related to its
normal operations management believes that there are no other commitments or
uncertainties that will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company

capital expenditures and resources

capital expenditures in 2002 totaled 1837 million compared to 3454 million
and 1012 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively the company invested 997
million on internal development and exploration of oil and gas properties during
2002 compared to 1085 million and 858 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively
the company invested 604 million on property acquisitions in 2002 compared to
1997 million and 49 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively property
acquisitions in 2002 included the purchase of certain assets located in the
vikingkinsella area in january 2002 from atco a canadian regulated gas
utility for approximately 344 million and 141 million for the purchase of
certain oil and gas properties located in wise and denton counties texas in
august 2002 the company also invested 193 million on plants and pipelines in
2002 compared to 346 million and 76 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively
property acquisitions and plants and pipelines in 2001 primarily included assets
from the canadian hunter exploration ltd hunter acquisition see note 2 of
notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding
the hunter acquisition capital expenditures in 2003 excluding proved property
acquisitions are expected to be approximately 14 billion capital
expenditures in 2003 are expected to be primarily for internal development and
exploration of oil and gas properties and plant and pipeline expenditures
capital expenditures are expected to be funded from internal cash flows

during the fourth quarter of 2001 the company announced its intent to sell
certain noncore nonstrategic properties in order to improve the overall
quality of its portfolio primarily in the us due to their high cost
structure high production volume decline rates and limited growth
opportunities substantially all of the gulf of mexico shelf and south and east
texas assets were included in the noncore nonstrategic properties during
2002 the company completed the sale of certain noncore nonstrategic
properties including the val verde plant based on the purchase and sale
agreements the divestiture program sales price totaled 13 billion due to
differences between purchase and sale agreement dates and closing dates the
company generated proceeds before post closing adjustments of approximately
12 billion and recognized a net pretax gain of 68 million the producing
properties that were sold during the year generated 202 million 401 million
and 416 million of revenues and incurred 140 million 478 million and 336
million of direct operating expenses during the years 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively the company used a portion of the proceeds generated from property
sales to retire commercial paper to repay the 104 million promissory note and
for general corporate purposes including funding a portion of the companys
capital program the company also expects to use the remaining proceeds for
general corporate purposes including funding a portion of the companys future
capital program

in connection with the divestiture program the company also recorded a
restructuring liability of 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as of
december 31 2002 all of the restructuring liability had been paid

marketing

north america us and canada

the companys marketing strategy is to maximize the value of its production by
developing marketing flexibility from the wellhead to its ultimate sale the
companys natural gas production is gathered processed exchanged and
transported utilizing various firm and interruptible contracts and routes to
access higher value market hubs the companys customers include local
distribution companies electric utilities industrial users and marketers the
company maintains the capacity to ensure its production can be marketed either
at the wellhead or downstream at market sensitive prices

all of the companys crude oil production is sold to third parties at the
wellhead or transported to market hubs where it is sold or exchanged ngls are
typically sold at field plants or transported to market hubs and sold to third
parties downgrades or the inability of the companys customers to maintain
their credit rating or credit worthiness could result in an increase in the
allowance for unrecoverable receivables from natural gas ngls or crude oil
revenues or it could result in a change in the companys assumption process of
evaluating collectibility based on situations regarding specific customers and
applicable economic conditions

other international

the companys other international production is marketed to third parties either
directly by the company or by the operators of the properties production is
sold at the platforms or local sales points based on spot or contract prices



qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk

commodity risk

substantially all of the companys crude oil ngls and natural gas production is
sold on the spot market or under shortterm contracts at market sensitive
prices spot market prices for domestic crude oil and natural gas are subject to
volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures market including among
others the new york mercantile exchange nymex quality differentials
worldwide political developments and the actions of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries also affect crude oil prices

                                        18
page

there is also a difference between the nymex futures contract price for a
particular month and the actual cash price received for that month in a north
america producing basin or at a north america market hub which is referred to
as the basis differential basis differentials can vary widely depending on
various factors including but not limited to local supply and demand

on january 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities it requires
enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value the requisite
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
use of the derivative and the resulting designation

the company utilizes overthecounter price and basis swaps as well as options
to hedge its production in order to decrease its price risk exposure the gains
and losses realized as a result of these price and basis derivative transactions
are substantially offset when the hedged commodity is delivered in order to
accommodate the needs of its customers the company also uses price swaps to
convert natural gas sold under fixedprice contracts to market sensitive prices

the company uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical
effect that changes in the market value of crude oil and natural gas may have on
the fair value of the companys derivative instruments for example at december
31 2002 the potential decrease in fair value of derivative instruments
assuming a 10 percent adverse movement an increase in the underlying
commodities prices would result in a 97 million decrease in the net unrealized
gain the derivative instruments in place at december 31 2002 hedged
approximately 30 percent of the companys expected natural gas production
volumes through 2003

for purposes of calculating the hypothetical change in fair value the relevant
variables include the type of commodity the commodity futures prices the
volatility of commodity prices and the basis and quality differentials the
hypothetical change in fair value is calculated by multiplying the difference
between the hypothetical price adjusted for any basis or quality differentials
and the contractual price by the contractual volumes as more fully described in
note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company periodically
assesses the effectiveness of its derivative instruments in achieving offsetting
cash flows attributable to the risks being hedged changes in basis
differentials or notional amounts of the hedged transactions could cause the
derivative instruments to fail the effectiveness test and result in the markto
market accounting for the affected derivative transactions which would be
reflected in the companys current period earnings

credit and market risks

the company manages and controls market and counterparty credit risk through
established formal internal control procedures which are reviewed on an ongoing
basis the company attempts to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties
through formal credit policies and monitoring procedures in the normal course
of business collateral is not required for financial instruments with credit
risk

foreign currency risk

the companys reported cash flows related to its canadian operating subsidiaries
are based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars and converted to the us
dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange
rates for the period reported the companys canadian operating subsidiaries
have no financial obligations that are denominated in us dollars

dividends

on january 22 2003 the board of directors declared a common stock quarterly
cash dividend of 01375 per share payable april 1 2003 to shareholders of
record on march 7 2003 dividend levels are determined by the board of
directors based on profitability capital expenditures financing and other
factors the company declared cash dividends on common stock totaling
approximately 111 million and paid dividends totaling approximately 139
million during 2002 during the year the company paid five quarterly dividends
including fourth quarter 2002 which normally would have been paid in january
2003

application of critical accounting policies

oil and gas reserves

the process of estimating quantities of natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves
is very complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all
available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a
given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous
factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving
production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production
under varying economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing
reserve estimates may occur from time to time although

                                        19
page

every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported
represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and
variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally
less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement
disclosures as described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial
statements the company uses the unitofproduction method to amortize its oil
and gas properties changes in reserve quantities as described above will cause
corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity
revision or in some cases an impairment charge in the period of the revision
see the supplementary financial information for reserve data

successful efforts method of accounting

the company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the successful efforts
method of accounting for its exploration and development activities acquisition
and development costs are capitalized and amortized using the unitofproduction
method based on proved and proved developed reserves estimated by the companys
reserve engineers changes in reserve quantities as described below will cause
corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity
revision unsuccessful exploration or dry hole wells are expensed in the period
in which the wells are determined to be dry and could have a significant effect
on results of operations

carrying value of longlived assets

as more fully described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements
the company performs an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable cash
flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon managements
estimates of proved crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves future crude oil
ngls and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves downward
revisions in estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates or
depressed crude oil ngls and natural gas prices could cause the company to
reduce the carrying amounts of its properties see note 13 of notes to
consolidated financial statements for impairment of oil and gas properties

costs attributable to the companys unproved properties are not subject to the
impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated
with such properties is subject to amortization on a composite basis based on
past experience and average property lives as these properties are developed
and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to
depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed
unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is
expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved
properties are written off depends on the timing and success of the companys
future exploration program

goodwill

as described in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements the
company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and
other intangible assets sfas no 142 requires an annual impairment assessment
in lieu of periodic amortization the impairment assessment requires management
to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which
goodwill has been assigned these estimates are based on future net cash flows
and are based upon managements estimates of proved reserves as well as the
success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves downward
revisions of estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates or
depressed crude oil ngls and natural gas prices could lead to an impairment of
all or a portion of goodwill in future periods

revenue recognition

natural gas ngls and crude oil revenues are recorded on the entitlement method
under the entitlement method revenue is recorded when title passes based on the
companys net interest the company records its entitled share of revenues based
on estimated production volumes subsequently these estimated volumes are
adjusted to reflect actual volumes that are supported by third party pipeline
statements or cash receipts since there is a ready market for crude oil
natural gas and ngls the company sells the majority of its products soon after
production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the
buyer

legal environmental and other contingencies

a provision for legal environmental and other contingencies is charged to
expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the
appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes
the subjective judgment of management in many cases managements judgment is
based on interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted
differently by regulators andor courts of law the companys management closely
monitors known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and
periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items
based on information available to the company

results of operations

year ended december 31 2002 compared with year ended december 31 2001

the company reported net income of 454 million or 225 diluted earnings per
common share in 2002 compared to net income of 561 million or 270 diluted
earnings per common share in 2001 net income in 2002 included a net after tax
gain of 46 million or 023 per diluted share related to the disposal of assets
and the reversal of a tax valuation reserve of 27 million or 013 per diluted
share related to the sale of assets in the united kingdom uk sector of the
north sea net income in 2002 included an after tax loss of 14 million or 007
per diluted share compared to an after tax gain of 6 million or 003 per
diluted share in 2001 consisting of ineffectiveness related to cashflow and
fairvalue hedges net income in 2002 also included an after tax loss of 6
million or 003 per diluted share compared to an after tax gain of 6 million
or 003 per diluted share in 2001 related to changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting

revenues

revenues decreased 455 million to 2964 million in 2002 from 3419 million in
2001 the 455 million decrease in revenues primarily consists of 627 million
related to lower natural gas and ngls prices and higher crude oil prices 31
million due to lower revenues related to ineffectiveness on cashflow and
fairvalue hedges 20 million due to lower revenues related to changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
and 22 million due to the sale of the val verde plant in the second quarter of
2002 these decreases in revenues were partially offset by increased revenues of
241 million related to higher gas and ngls sales volumes and lower oil sales
volumes details of commodity prices and sales volumes variances are described
below

  price variances

average natural gas prices including a 016 realized gain per mcf related to
hedging activities decreased 084 per mcf in 2002 to 319 per mcf from 403
per mcf including a 048 loss per mcf related to hedging activities in 2001
lower average natural gas prices resulted in decreased revenues of 588 million
during 2002 imbedded in the average natural gas prices during 2002 was also the
impact of location basis differentials that varied widely compared to the same
period in 2001 primarily in the western us and western canada average ngls
prices decreased 233 per barrel in 2002 to 1446 per barrel from 1679 per
barrel in 2001 resulting in reduced revenues of 51 million during 2002
average crude oil prices including an 018 realized gain per barrel related to
hedging activities increased 066 per barrel in 2002 to 2411 per barrel from
2345 per barrel including a 110 loss per barrel related to hedging
activities in 2001 higher average crude oil prices resulted in increased
revenues of 12 million during 2002

  volume variances

average natural gas sales volumes increased 192 mmcf per day in 2002 to 1916
mmcf per day from 1724 mmcf per day in 2001 resulting in increased revenues of

day in 2001 reducing revenues 121 million during 2002 average natural gas
sales volumes in canada increased 369 mmcf per day primarily due to the
acquisitions of hunter in late 2001 and atco in early 2002 and an aggressive
drilling program the increase of 369 mmcf per day in canada was partially
offset by reductions of 172 mmcf per day resulting from natural declines in
production and asset sales in the onshore gulf coast the gulf of mexico shelf
the san juan basin and the permian basin average ngls sales volumes in canada
also increased 149 mbbls per day primarily due to the acquisition of hunter
average crude oil sales volumes decreased 124 mbbls per day primarily due to
natural declines in production and asset sales in the gulf of mexico shelf
canada and the permian basin

total costs and other incomenet

total costs and other incomenet were 2395 million in 2002 compared to 2512
million in 2001 total costs and other incomenet in 2001 included 184 million
related to the impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale and a
restructuring charge of 10 million related to severance and other exit costs
excluding the 194 million charges in 2001 total costs and other incomenet in
2002 increased 77 million the 77 million increase was primarily due to a 98
million increase in dda an 84 million increase in interest expense a 28
million increase in exploration costs a 13 million increase in transportation
expenses and a 12 million increase in administrative expenses partially offset
by a 60 million increase in gain on disposal of assets a 43 million decrease
in taxes other than income taxes a 28 million decrease in production and
processing expenses excluding the 10 million restructuring charge in 2001 and
a 27 million increase in other incomenet

dda increased primarily due to a higher unitofproduction rate related to
changes in production resulting from the canadian acquisitions which had higher
rates than the average unitofproduction rates for the company dda also

increased due to higher natural gas production volumes in canada interest
expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances during 2002 resulting
from the hunter acquisition in late 2001 and other property acquisitions
consummated in early 2002 exploration costs increased primarily due to higher
amortization of undeveloped lease costs of 54 million higher drilling rig
costs of 17 million and higher geological and geophysical gg and other
expenses of 20 million partially offset by lower exploratory dry hole costs of
63 million the higher drilling rig expenses which were approximately 40
million during 2002 were attributable to the subletting of a deepwater drilling
rig currently under lease to the company this 40 million charge covers the
anticipated loss for the remaining term of the lease transportation expenses
increased primarily due to higher contract rates administrative expenses
increased primarily due to higher payroll and benefits gain on disposal of
assets was higher due to the divestiture of noncore nonstrategic properties
taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to lower crude oil and
natural gas revenues production and processing expenses decreased primarily due
to lower well operating costs other incomenet increased primarily due to
higher interest income lower foreign currency transaction losses and lower
miscellaneous expenses incurred in 2002 compared to 2001

income tax expense

income tax expense was 115 million in the 2002 compared to 349 million in
2001 the decrease in tax expense was primarily due to lower pretax income the
company also recorded benefits of 86 million in 2002 compared to 20 million in
2001 related to interest deductions allowed in both the us and canada on
transactions associated with crossborder financing entered into in the second
half of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 year 2002 also included the reversal
of a tax valuation reserve of 27 million in september 2002 related to the sale
of assets in the uk sector of the north sea the company also recorded a
benefit of 26 million and 3 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively due to a
reduction in the alberta provincial corporate tax rate in canada the benefit in
2002 was partially offset by an increase in expense of 12 million related to an
increase in the uks income tax rate net section 29 tax credits were 1
million in 2002 compared to 24 million in 2001

year ended december 31 2001 compared with year ended december 31 2000

earnings per common share in 2000 net income in 2001 included a noncash after
tax charge of 116 million or 056 per diluted share primarily related to the
impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale the company evaluates the
impairment of its oil and gas properties on a fieldbyfield basis whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not
be recoverable in december 2001 primarily as a result of the companys
decision to exit the gulf of mexico shelf and divest of certain other
properties the company recognized a pretax charge of 184 million 116 million
after tax related to those properties the company also recognized a 6 million
after tax restructuring charge or 003 per share related to severance and other
exit costs net income in 2001 also included an after tax gain of 6 million or
003 per diluted share related to ineffectiveness on cashflow and fairvalue
hedges and an after tax gain of 6 million or 003 per diluted share related to
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for

hedging activities as amended for more discussion of sfas no 133 see note 1
of notes to consolidated financial statements the results of operations for
2001 included one month of activities related to the hunter acquisition

revenues

revenues increased 201 million to 3419 million in 2001 from 3218 million in
2000 the 201 million increase in revenues primarily consists of 291 million
related to higher natural gas prices and lower crude oil and ngls prices 10
million due to higher revenues related to changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and 9 million
related to ineffectiveness on cashflow and fairvalue hedges these increases
in revenues were partially offset by decreased revenues of 107 million related
to lower commodity sales volumes

average crude oil sales volumes decreased 105 mbbls per day in 2001 to 632
mbbls per day from 737 mbbls per day in 2000 reducing revenues 99 million
during 2001 average natural gas sales volumes were the same as the prior year
at 1724 mmcf per day however due to one less day in 2001 compared to 2000
natural gas revenues were down 6 million average ngls sales volumes decreased
slightly to 471 mbbls per day in 2001 from 472 mbbls per day in 2000
resulting in lower revenues of 2 million average crude oil sales volumes
decreased 81 mbbls per day primarily due to natural declines in production and
reduced capital spending in the deepwater gulf of mexico the gulf of mexico
shelf and south louisiana areas and natural declines in production and property
sales in 2000 in other international although total natural gas sales volumes
were the same as the prior year average natural gas sales volumes were higher
in canada and the east irish sea average natural gas sales volumes in canada
increased 92 mmcf per day primarily due to a successful drilling program and the
hunter acquisition in late 2001 average natural gas sales volumes in the east
irish sea increased 36 mmcf per day primarily due to an additional interest
acquired in the area these increases were offset primarily due to lower natural
gas sales volumes of 128 mmcf per day as a result of lower capital spending in
the gulf of mexico shelf and natural declines in production in the san juan
basin south louisiana and other international

total costs and other incomenet

total costs and other incomenet were 2512 million in 2001 compared to 2251
million in 2000 the 261 million increase was primarily due to a 184 million
increase in impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale a 35 million
increase in production and processing expenses including 10 million related to
severance and other exit costs a 32 million increase in transportation
expenses a 25 million increase in dda a 21 million increase in exploration
costs a 7 million increase in taxes other than income taxes and a 3 million
increase in administrative expenses partially offset by a 33 million increase
in other incomenet a 7 million decrease in interest expense and a 6 million
increase in gain on disposal of assets

production and processing expenses increased primarily due to higher workover
expense higher service electrical and lease fuel costs dda increased
primarily due to a higher unitofproduction rate related to changes in
production primarily resulting from the canadian acquisitions which had higher
rates than average unitofproduction rates for the company and higher finding
costs exploration costs increased primarily due to higher drilling rig expenses
of 29 million and higher exploratory dry hole costs of 28 million partially
offset by lower gg and other expenses of 21 million and lower amortization of
undeveloped lease costs of 16 million transportation expenses increased
primarily due to higher tariffs and taxes other than income taxes increased
primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas revenues interest expense
decreased primarily due to higher capitalized interest during 2001 other
incomenet increased primarily due to higher interest income in 2001 as a
result of excess cash on hand during the year higher gain on disposal of assets
and lower interest expense related to tax matters administrative expenses in
2001 compared to 2000 increased 3 million however year 2000 administrative
expenses included a legal accrual of 32 million related to certain litigation
this 32 million was partially offset by the reversal of a 26 million valuation
allowance related to a receivable due from a former affiliate the company
reversed the 26 million valuation allowance after reevaluating the issues and
concluding that it was probable that the receivable would be collected

income taxes

income tax expense was 349 million in 2001 compared to 292 million in 2000
the increase in tax expense was primarily due to lower tax benefits related to
section 29 tax credits and taxaccrual adjustments partially offset by lower tax
on 2001 pretax income section 29 tax credits were 24 million in 2001 compared
to 52 million in 2000 favorable taxaccrual adjustments were 21 million in
2001 compared to 56 million in 2000 primarily related to prior period activity

acquisition2001

on december 5 2001 the company consummated a transaction with hunter valued at
approximately us 21 billion resulting in an excess purchase price of
approximately 793 million which was reflected as goodwill this acquisition was
funded with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuances of 15 billion of
fixedrate notes and 400 million of commercial paper the transaction was
accounted for under the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 141 see
note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information
related to this transaction

legal proceedings

the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as
defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims
act these lawsuits were consolidated during 1999 and 2000 for pretrial
proceedings by the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in
the matter of in re natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united
states district court for the district of wyoming mdl1293 the plaintiffs
contend that defendants underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on
federal and indian lands through the use of belowmarket

                                        23
page

prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions
with affiliated companies plaintiffs allege that the royalties paid by
defendants were lower than the royalties required to be paid under federal
regulations and that the forms filed by defendants with the minerals management
service mms reporting these royalty payments were false thereby violating the
civil false claims act the united states has intervened in certain of the
mdl1293 cases as to some of the defendants including the company the
plaintiffs and the intervenor have not specified in their pleadings the amount
of damages they seek from the company

various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the united
states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of natural gas
produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general these
proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the companys royalty payments over
various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant federal
regulations most of these proceedings involve production volumes and royalty
disputes that are the subject of natural gas royalties qui tam litigation

based on the companys present understanding of the various governmental and
civil false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it
has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such
defenses the company is also exploring the possibility of a settlement of these
claims although there has been no formal demand for damages the company
currently estimates based on its communications with the intervenor that the
amount of underpaid royalties on onshore production claimed by the intervenor in
these proceedings is approximately 68 million in the event that the company is
found to have violated the civil false claims act the company could also be
subject to double damages civil monetary penalties and other sanctions
including a temporary suspension from bidding on and entering into future
federal mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time
the company has established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to
provide for this potential liability based upon its evaluation of this matter
while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through
settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company
although cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in
which such matters are resolved

the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal
netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no
98854 filed in 1995 in the district court in the hague and currently pending
in the court of appeal in the hague the netherlands plaintiffs who are
working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that the
company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger field in
the l16a block unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly enriched by
producing part of the oil from the adjoining q1 block the plaintiffs claim
that the defendants infringed upon plaintiffs right to produce the minerals
present in its license area and acted in violation of generally accepted
standards by failing to inform plaintiffs of the overlap of the logger field
into the q1 block plaintiffs seek damages of 975 million as of january 1
1997 plus interest for all relevant periods the company owned a 375 percent
working interest in the logger field following a trial the district court in
the hague rendered a judgment in favor of the defendants including the company
dismissing all claims plaintiffs thereafter appealed on october 19 2000 the
court of appeal in the hague issued an interim judgment in favor of the
plaintiffs and ordered that additional evidence be presented to the court
relating to issues of both liability and damages the company and the other
defendants are continuing to present evidence to the court and vigorously assert
defenses against these claims the company has also asserted claims of indemnity
against two of the defendants from whom it had acquired a portion of its working
interest share if the company is successful in enforcing the indemnities its
working interest share of any adverse judgment could be reduced to 15 percent
for some of the periods covered by plaintiffs lawsuit the company is unable at
this time to reasonably predict the outcome or in the event of an unfavorable
outcome to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any in
this lawsuit accordingly there has been no reserve established for this
matter

in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental
and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including
claims for personal injury and property damage claims challenging oil and gas
royalty and severance tax payments claims related to joint interest billings
under oil and gas operating agreements claims alleging mismeasurement of
volumes and wrongful analysis of heating content of natural gas and other claims
in the nature of contract regulatory or employment disputes none of the
governmental proceedings involve foreign governments while the ultimate outcome
of these other lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty
management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of
operations or cash flows of the company

the company has established reserves for legal proceedings which are included in
other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet the
establishment of a reserve involves a complex estimation process that includes
the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while
management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible
that the company could incur additional loss of up to approximately 25 million
to 30 million in excess of the amounts currently accrued future changes in the
facts and circumstances could result in actual liability exceeding the estimated
ranges of loss and the amounts accrued

recent accounting pronouncements

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 46
which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities fin no 46 clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin
no 51 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin no 46
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31
2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an
interest after that date it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period
beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003
the company does not expect to identify any variable interest entities that must
be consolidated in the event a variable interest entity is identified the
company does not expect the requirements of fin no 46 to have a material impact
on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting
and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others fin no 45 fin no 45 requires certain guarantees to
be recorded at fair value which is different from current practice to record a
liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable as those terms
are defined in fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies fin no 45
also requires the company to make significant new disclosures about guarantees
the disclosure requirements of fin no 45 are effective for the company in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2003 fin no 45s initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after december 31 2002 the companys previous accounting
for guarantees issued prior to the date of the initial application of fin no 45
will not be revised or restated to reflect the provisions of fin no 45 the
company does not expect the adoption of fin no 45 to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies
emerging issues task force issue no 943 liability recognition for certain
employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including
certain costs incurred in a restructuring sfas no 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective
for initial measurement of the liability the provisions of sfas no 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31
2002 the company adopted sfas no 146 on january 1 2003 but at this time this
statement has no effect on the companys consolidated financial position or
results of operations

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements no
4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections sfas
no 145 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002
provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have
economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions the company
adopted sfas no 145 on january 1 2003 but at this time this statement has no
effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of
operations

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations sfas no 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related
longlived asset subsequently the asset retirement cost should be allocated to
expense using a systematic and rational method sfas no 143 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 based on current estimates the
company expects to record a netoftax cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle loss in the first quarter of 2003 of approximately 59 million in
accordance with the provisions of sfas no 143 there will be no impact on the
companys cash flows as a result of adopting sfas no 143

safe harbor cautionary disclosure on forwardlooking statements

the company in discussions of its future plans expectations objectives and
anticipated performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the sec
or documents incorporated by reference therein may include projections or
other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor
provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section
27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act
of 1934 as amended forwardlooking statements can be identified by the words
expects anticipates intends plans believes should and similar
expressions projections and forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions
which the company believes are reasonable but are by their nature inherently
uncertain in all cases there can be no assurance that such assumptions will
prove correct or that projected events will occur and actual results could
differ materially from those projected some of the important factors that could
cause actual results to differ from any such projections or other
forwardlooking statements follow

                                        25
page

commodity priceschanges in crude oil ngls and natural gas prices including
basis differentials from those assumed in preparing projections and
forwardlooking statements could cause the companys actual financial results to
differ materially from projected financial results and can also impact the
companys determination of proved reserves and the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows relative to crude oil ngls and natural gas
reserves in addition periods of sharply lower commodity prices could affect
the companys production levels andor cause it to curtail capital spending
projects and delay or defer exploration exploitation or development projects

projections relating to the price received by the company for natural gas and
ngls also rely on assumptions regarding the availability and pricing of
transportation to the companys key markets in particular the company has
contractual arrangements for the transportation of natural gas from the san juan
basin eastward to eastern and midwestern markets or to market hubs in texas
oklahoma and louisiana the natural gas price received by the company could be
adversely affected by any constraints in pipeline capacity to serve these
markets these and other commodity price risks that could cause actual results
to differ from projections and forwardlooking statements are further described
in part ii commodity risk

exploration and production riskthe companys business is subject to all of the
risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and
development and production of crude oil ngls and natural gas including
uncertainties as the presence size and recoverability of hydrocarbons the
exploration for crude oil and natural gas is a highrisk business in which
significant numbers of dry holes and high associated costs can be incurred in
the process of seeking commercial discoveries

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain
and involves subjective engineering geological geophysical and economic
determinations in this regard changes in the economic conditions including
commodity prices or operating conditions including without limitation
exploration development and production costs and expenses and drilling results
from exploration and development activity could cause the companys estimated
proved reserves or production to differ from those included in any such
forwardlooking statements or projections reserves which require the use of
improved recovery techniques for production are included in proved reserves if
supported by a successful pilot project or the operation of an installed
program

projecting future crude oil ngls and natural gas production is imprecise
producing oil and gas reservoirs eventually have declining production rates
projections of production rates rely on certain assumptions regarding historical
production patterns in the area or formation tests for a particular producing
horizon actual production rates could differ materially from such projections
production rates depend on a number of additional factors including commodity
prices market demand and the political economic and regulatory climate

another major factor affecting the companys production is its ability to
replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through acquisition exploration
or development programs exploration success is extremely difficult to predict
with certainty particularly over the short term where the timing and extent of
successful results vary widely over the long term the ability to replace
reserves depends not only on the companys ability to locate crude oil ngls and
natural gas reserves but on the cost of finding and developing such reserves
moreover development of any particular exploration or development project may
not be justified because of the commodity price environment at the time or
because of the companys finding and development costs for such project no
assurances can be given as to the level or timing of success that the company
will be able to achieve in acquiring or finding and developing additional
reserves

projections relating to the companys production and financial results rely on
certain assumptions about the companys continued success in its acquisition and
asset rationalization programs and in its cost management efforts

the companys drilling operations are subject to various hazards common to the
oil and gas industry including weather conditions explosions fires and
blowouts which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells or
formations production facilities and other property and injury to people they
are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations such as
capsizing collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions

development riska significant portion of the companys development plans
involve large projects in canada algeria the east irish sea china wyoming
north dakota and other areas a variety of factors affect the timing and outcome
of such projects including without limitation approval by the other parties
owning working interests in the project receipt of necessary permits and
approvals by applicable governmental agencies access to surface locations and
facilities the availability costs and performance of the necessary drilling
equipment and infrastructure drilling risks operating hazards unexpected cost
increases and technical difficulties in constructing modifying and operating
equipment plants and facilities delivery schedules for critical equipment and
arrangements for the gathering and transportation of the produced hydrocarbons

foreign operations riskthe companys operations outside of the us are
subject to risks inherent in foreign operations including without limitation
the loss of revenue property and equipment from hazards such as expropriation
nationalization war insurrection acts of terrorism and other political risks
increases in taxes and governmental royalties renegotiation or abrogation of
contracts with governmental entities changes in laws and policies governing
operations of foreignbased companies currency restrictions and exchange rate
fluctuations world economic cycles restrictions or

                                        26
page

quotas on production and commodity sales and other uncertainties arising out of
foreign government sovereignty over the companys international operations laws
and policies of the us affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely
affect the companys international operations

the companys ability to market crude oil ngls and natural gas discovered or
produced in its foreign operations and the price the company could obtain for
such production depends on many factors beyond the companys control including
ready markets for crude oil ngls and natural gas the proximity and capacity of
pipelines and other transportation facilities fluctuating demand for crude oil
and natural gas the availability and cost of competing fuels and the effects
of foreign governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales pipeline
and processing facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and
therefore any actual sales of the companys production could be delayed for
extended periods of time until such facilities are constructed

competitionthe company actively competes for property acquisitions
exploration leases and sales of crude oil ngls and natural gas frequently
against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources in
its marketing activities the company competes with numerous companies for gas
purchasing and processing contracts and for natural gas and ngls at several
stages in the distribution chain competitive factors in the companys business
include price contract terms quality of service pipeline access
transportation discounts and distribution efficiencies

legal and regulatory riskthe companys operations are affected by foreign
national state and local laws and regulations restrictions on production
price or gathering rate controls changes in taxes royalties and other amounts
payable to governments or governmental agencies and other changes in or
litigation arising under laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could
have a significant effect on the companys operations or financial results
other legal and regulatory risks that could cause actual results to differ from
projections and other forwardlooking statements are described in part i other
matters

political and security riskdomestic and international political and security
risks including changes in government seizure of property civil unrest armed
hostilities and acts of terrorism could have a significant effect on the
companys operations or financial results

environmental regulations and liabilitiesthe companys operations are subject
to various foreign national state and local laws and regulations covering the
discharge of material into and protection of the environment such regulations
and liability for remedial actions under environmental regulations affect the
costs of planning designing operating and abandoning facilities the company
expends considerable resources both financial and managerial to comply with
environmental regulations and permitting requirements although the company
believes that its operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations risks of substantial costs and
liabilities are inherent in crude oil and natural gas operations moreover it
is possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental
laws regulations and enforcement and claims for damage to property or persons
resulting from the companys current or discontinued operations could result in
substantial costs and liabilities in the future

                   notes to consolidated financial statements

1 accounting policies

principles of consolidation and reporting

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of burlington
resources inc br and its majorityowned subsidiaries collectively the
company all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation investments in entities in which the company has a significant
ownership interest generally 20 to 50 percent or otherwise does not exercise
control are accounted for using the equity method under the equity method the
investments are stated at cost plus the companys equity in undistributed
earnings and losses the consolidated financial statements for previous periods
include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to current
presentation such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net
income or stockholders equity

cash and cash equivalents

all shortterm investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are
considered cash equivalents cash equivalents are stated at cost which
approximates market value

inventories

inventories of materials supplies and products are valued at the lower of
average cost or market

properties

oil and gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method
under this method all development costs and acquisition costs of proved
properties are capitalized and amortized on a unitofproduction basis over the
remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves respectively
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized but charged to
expense if and when a well is determined to be unsuccessful costs of unproved
properties are capitalized and amortized on a composite basis based on past
success experience and average property lives

the company evaluates the impairment of its oil and gas properties on a
fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an
assets carrying amount may not be recoverable unamortized capital costs are
reduced to fair value if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows
is less than the assets net book value cash flows are determined based upon
proved reserves using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal
decision making the underlying commodity prices embedded in the companys
estimated cash flows are the product of a process that begins with the nymex
pricing and adjusted for estimated location and quality differentials as well
as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices
although prices used are likely to approximate market they do not necessarily
represent current market prices given that spot hydrocarbon market prices are
subject to volatile changes it is the companys opinion that a longterm look
at market prices will lead to a more appropriate valuation of longterm assets

costs of retired sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an
amortization base are charged or credited net of proceeds to accumulated
depreciation depletion and amortization gains or losses from the disposal of
other properties are recognized currently expenditures for maintenance repairs
and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are
expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized estimated
dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and gas properties are capitalized
net of salvage at their estimated net present value and amortized on a
unitofproduction basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed
reserves the companys abandonment liability included in other liabilities and
deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet was 106 million and 201
million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

other properties include gas plants pipelines buildings data processing and
telecommunications equipment office furniture and equipment and other fixed
assets these items are recorded at cost and are depreciated on the
straightline method based on expected lives of the individual assets or group
of assets

revenue recognition

natural gas ngls and crude oil revenues are recorded on the entitlement method
under the entitlement method revenue is recorded when title passes based on the
companys net interest the company records its entitled share of revenues based
on estimated production volumes subsequently these estimated volumes are
adjusted to reflect actual volumes that are supported by third party pipeline
statements or cash receipts since there is a ready market for crude oil
natural gas and ngls the company sells the majority of its products soon after
production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the
buyer as a result the company maintains a minimum amount of product inventory
in storage at december 31 2002 and 2001 product inventory was 5 million and
3 million respectively gas imbalances

           notes to consolidated financial statements  continued

occur when the company sells more or less than its entitled ownership percentage
of total gas production any amount received in excess of the companys share is
treated as a liability if the company receives less than it is entitled the
underproduction is recorded as a receivable at december 31 2002 and 2001 the
company had net gas imbalance receivables of 19 million and 39 million
respectively

royalty payable

it is the companys policy to calculate and pay royalties on gas oil and ngls
in accordance with the particular contractual provisions of lease license or
concession agreements and the laws and regulations applicable to those
agreements royalty liabilities are recorded in the period in which the gas
oil or ngls are produced

functional currency

the assets liabilities and operations of brs canadian operating subsidiaries
are measured using the canadian dollar as the functional currency these assets
and liabilities are translated into united states us dollars at
endofperiod exchange rates gains and losses related to translating these
assets and liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income revenue and
expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in
effect during the period the assets liabilities and results of operations of
foreign entities other than brs canadian operating subsidiaries are measured
using the us dollar as the functional currency for subsidiaries where the
us dollar is the functional currency all foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars at endofperiod exchange
rates inventories prepaid expenses and properties are exceptions to this
policy and are remeasured at historical rates foreign currency revenues and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the year

that are remeasured at historical exchange rates exchange gains and losses
arising from remeasured foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
liabilities are included in other expense incomenet in the consolidated
statement of income included in net income for the years ended december 31

commodity hedging contracts and other derivatives

the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps to
hedge future crude oil and natural gas production in order to mitigate the risk
of market price fluctuations the company also enters into derivative contracts
to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on january
1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas
no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
amended effective with the adoption of sfas no 133 all derivatives were
recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value if the derivative
does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the gain or loss on
the derivative is recognized currently in earnings if the derivative qualifies
for hedge accounting the gain or loss on the derivative is either recognized in
income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged
for fairvalue hedges or deferred in other comprehensive income to the extent
the hedge is effective for cashflow hedges to qualify for hedge accounting
the derivative must qualify as either a fairvalue cashflow or
foreigncurrency hedge

the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must
be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash
flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on
an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedging instrument becomes
ineffective the company assesses hedge effectiveness based on total changes in
the fair value of options used in cashflow hedges rather than changes of
intrinsic value only as a result changes in the entire fair value of option
contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the
hedged transaction affects earnings to the extent such contracts are effective
gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
cashflow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged until the
related production is delivered adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged
production is discontinued in instances where the related fairvalue hedging
instrument becomes ineffective the balance in the fairvalue hedge adjustment
account is recorded in income when the related production is delivered if the
company determines that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will
not occur deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in
earnings immediately

gains and losses on hedging instruments and adjustments of the carrying amounts
of hedged production are included in revenues and are included in realized
prices in the period that the related production is delivered gains and losses
on hedging instruments which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and
losses on derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are
also included in revenues in the period in which they occur the resulting cash
flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities

credit and market risks

the company manages and controls market and counterparty credit risk through
established formal internal control procedures which are reviewed on an ongoing
basis the company attempts to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties
through formal credit policies and monitoring procedures generally collateral
is not required for financial instruments with credit risk

income taxes

income taxes are provided based on earnings reported for tax return purposes in
addition to a provision for deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are
provided to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities tax credits are
accounted for under the flowthrough method which reduces the provision for
income taxes in the year the tax credits are earned a valuation allowance is
established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the
related tax benefits will not be realized

stockbased compensation

at december 31 2002 the company has three stockbased employee compensation
plans which are described more fully in note 9

the company uses the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stockbased
compensation as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 and
related interpretations under this method the company records no compensation
expense for stock options granted when the exercise price for options granted is
equal to the fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of the
grant

the weighted average fair values of options granted during the years 2002 2001
and 2000 were 1083 1335 and 1033 respectively the fair values of
employee stock options were calculated using a variation of the blackscholes
stock option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for
grants in 2002 2001 and 2000 stock price volatility of 31 percent 35 percent
and 35 percent respectively risk free rate of return ranging from 3 percent to
5 percent dividend yield of 143 percent 132 percent and 146 percent
respectively and an expected term of 3 to 5 years

the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no
123 accounting for stockbased compensation to stockbased employee
compensation the fair value of stock options included in the pro forma amounts
is not necessarily indicative of future effects on net income and earnings per
common share eps

environmental costs

environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate
depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future
economic benefit

           notes to consolidated financial statements  continued

are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an
undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities
are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated

earnings per common share

basic eps is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for computing basic eps was
201 million 207 million and 216 million for the years ended december 31 2002
2001 and 2000 respectively diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for computing diluted eps including dilutive stock options
was 202 million 208 million and 216 million for the years ended december 31
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively for the years ended december 31 2002 2001
and 2000 approximately 4 million shares attributable to the exercise of
outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps because
the effect was antidilutive the company has no preferred stock or other
convertible securities affecting eps and therefore no adjustments related to
preferred stock or other convertible securities were made to reported net income
in the computation of eps

use of estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the
most significant estimates pertain to proved oil ngls and gas reserve volumes
and the future development dismantlement and abandonment costs as well as
estimates relating to certain gas ngls and oil revenues and expenses actual
results could differ from those estimates

texas assets were included in the noncore nonstrategic properties during
2002 the company completed the sale of certain noncore nonstrategic
properties including the val verde plant based on the purchase and sale
agreements the divestiture program sales price totaled 13 billion due to
differences between purchase and sale agreement dates and closing dates the

3 goodwill

effective january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets sfas no 142 requires the company to test goodwill for
impairment rather than amortize under the transition provisions of sfas no
142 goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date
is after june 30 2001 is not to be amortized and is to be reviewed for
impairment under existing standards until adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1
2002 the entire goodwill balance of 803 million at december 31 2002 which is
not deductible for tax purposes is related to the acquisition of hunter on
december 5 2001 accordingly the company recorded no goodwill amortization
during 2001 with the acquisition of hunter the company gained hunters
significant interest in canadas deep basin north americas thirdlargest
natural gas field increased its critical mass and enhanced its position as a
leading north american natural gas producer the company also obtained the
exploration expertise of hunters workforce gained additional cost
optimization increased purchasing power and gained greater marketing

           notes to consolidated financial statements  continued

all of the goodwill was assigned to the companys canadian reporting unit which
consists of all of the companys canadian subsidiaries the initial adoption of
sfas no 142 required the company to perform a twostep fair value based
goodwill impairment test as of january 1 2002 the first step of the test
compares the book value of the companys reporting unit to its estimated fair
value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is only required if the
net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the second step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill in
accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas no 142 to its book value to
determine if an impairment is required during the second quarter of 2002 the
company completed the first step of its impairment analysis related to its
goodwill and determined that the companys fair value of its canadian reporting
unit exceeded its net book value at january 1 2002 thereby eliminating the
need for the second step

in addition to the initial impairment test sfas no 142 requires companies to
test goodwill for impairment annually the company performed step one of its
annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined
that the fair value of the companys canadian reporting unit exceeded its net
book value as of september 30 2002 therefore step two was not required

the following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount including the
final purchase accounting adjustment of goodwill during the year as it relates

participation or subletting to the extent possible in addition the company has
other drilling rig commitments of 6 million 5 million and 1 million for
2003 2004 and 2005 respectively

legal proceedings

the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as
defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims
act these lawsuits were consolidated during 1999 and 2000 for pretrial
proceedings by the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in
the matter of in re natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united
states district court for the district of wyoming mdl1293 the plaintiffs
contend that defendants underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on
federal and indian lands through the use of belowmarket prices improper
deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated
companies during the period of 1985 to the present plaintiffs allege that the
royalties paid by defendants were lower than the royalties required to be paid
under federal regulations and that the forms filed by defendants with the
minerals management service mms reporting these royalty payments were false
thereby violating the civil false claims act the united states has intervened
in certain of the mdl1293 cases as to some of the defendants including the
company the plaintiffs and the intervenor have not specified in their pleadings
the amount of damages they seek from the company

various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the united
states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of natural gas
produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general these
proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the companys royalty payments over
various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant federal
regulations most of these proceedings involve production volumes and royalties
that are the subject of natural gas royalties qui tam litigation

based on the companys present understanding of the various governmental and
civil false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it
has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such
defenses the company is also exploring the possibility of a settlement of these
claims although there has been no formal demand for damages the company
currently estimates based on its communications with the intervenor that the
amount of underpaid royalties on onshore production claimed by the intervenor in
these proceedings is approximately 68 million in the event that the company is
found to have violated the civil false claims act the company could also be
subject to double damages civil monetary penalties and other sanctions
including a temporary suspension from bidding on and entering into future
federal mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time
the company has established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to
provide for this potential liability based upon its evaluation of this matter
while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through
settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company
although cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in
which such matters are resolved

the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal
netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no
98854 filed in 1995 in the district court in the hague and currently pending
in the court of appeal in the hague the netherlands plaintiffs who are
working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that the
company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger field in
the l16a block unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly enriched by
producing part of the oil from the adjoining q1 block the plaintiffs claim
that the defendants infringed upon plaintiffs right to produce the minerals
present in its license area and acted in violation of generally accepted
standards by failing to inform plaintiffs of the overlap of the

logger field into the q1 block plaintiffs seek damages of 975 million as of
january 1 1997 plus interest for all relevant periods the company owned a
375 percent working interest in the logger field following a trial the
district court in the hague rendered a judgment in favor of the defendants
including the company dismissing all claims plaintiffs thereafter appealed on
october 19 2000 the court of appeal in the hague issued an interim judgment in
favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that additional evidence be presented to the
court relating to issues of both liability and damages the company and the
other defendants are continuing to present evidence to the court and vigorously
assert defenses against these claims the company has also asserted claims of
indemnity against two of the defendants from whom it had acquired a portion of
its working interest share if the company is successful in enforcing the
indemnities its working interest share of any adverse judgment could be reduced
to 15 percent for some of the periods covered by plaintiffs lawsuit the
company is unable at this time to reasonably predict the outcome or in the
event of an unfavorable outcome to reasonably estimate the possible loss or
range of loss if any in this lawsuit accordingly there has been no reserve
established for this matter

in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental
and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including
claims for personal injury and property damage claims challenging oil and gas
royalty and severance tax payments claims related to joint interest billings
under oil and gas operating agreements claims alleging mismeasurement of
volumes and wrongful analysis of heating content of natural gas and other claims
in the nature of contract regulatory or employment disputes none of the
governmental proceedings involve foreign governments while the ultimate outcome
of these other lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty
management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of
operations or cash flows of the company

the company has established reserves for legal proceedings which are included in
other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheet the
establishment of a reserve involves a complex estimation process that includes
the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while
management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible
that the company could incur additional loss of up to approximately 25 million
to 30 million in excess of the amounts currently accrued future changes in the
facts and circumstances could result in actual liability exceeding the estimated
ranges of loss and the amounts accrued

1 see discussion of longterm debt commercial paper above and note 6 of notes
    to consolidated financial statements

     certain of the companys contracts require the posting of collateral upon
request in the event that the companys longterm debt is rated below investment
grade or ceases to be rated those contracts primarily consist of hedging
agreements two canadian transportation agreements and a natural gas purchase
agreement a few of the hedging agreements also require posting of collateral if
the market value of the transactions thereunder exceed a specified dollar
threshold that varies with the companys credit rating

     while the marktomarket positions under the hedging agreements and the
natural gas purchase agreement will fluctuate with commodity prices as a
producer the companys liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative
instruments tends to increase when commodity prices increase consequently the
company is most likely to have its largest unfavorable marktomarket position
in a high commodity price environment when it is least likely that a credit
support requirement due to an adverse rating action would occur at december 31
2001 a rating change would have had no impact on the company related to the
hedging agreements since the marktomarket position under each of the
respective agreements was favorable to the company in the case of the canadian
transportation agreements the collateral required would be an amount equal to
12 months of estimated demand charges that amount totaled approximately 9
million as of december 31 2001

     in the normal course of business the company has performance obligations
which are supported by surety bonds or letters of credit these obligations are
primarily site restoration and dismantlement royalty payments and exploration
programs where governmental organizations require such support

     changes in credit rating also impact the cost of borrowing under the
companys revolvers but have no impact on availability of credit under the
agreements the revolvers are filed as exhibits 1018 1019 and 1032 to this
form 10k

     the company has investments in two entities that it accounts for under the
equity method the book values of the companys interests in lost creek
gathering company llc lost creek and clam petroleum bv clam are 8
million and 24 million respectively lost creek and clam have debt obligations
in the amount of 53 million and 20 million respectively that are
nonrecourse to the company management believes that even if the companys
share of the debt obligations of these entities were deemed obligations of the
company the amounts would not have a material impact on the companys
liquidity

     in december 2000 the companys board of directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 1 billion of the companys common stock during 2001 the
company repurchased 161 million shares of its common stock for approximately
684 million through december 31 2001 the company has repurchased
approximately 163 million shares or 693 million of its common stock under this
1 billion authorization

     the company has certain other commitments and uncertainties related to its
normal operations management believes that there are no other commitments or
uncertainties that will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company

capital expenditures and resources

     capital expenditures for 2001 totaled 3454 million compared to 1012
million and 989 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively the company invested
1085 million on internal development and exploration of oil and gas properties
during 2001 compared to 858 million and 792 million in 2000 and 1999
respectively the company invested 1997 million for property acquisitions in
2001 compared to 49 million and 135 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively
the company also invested 346 million on plants and pipelines in 2001 compared
to 76 million and 18 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively property
acquisitions and plants and pipelines in 2001 primarily include assets from the
hunter acquisition see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for
additional information capital expenditures for 2002 excluding proved property
acquisitions are projected to be approximately 13 billion capital
expenditures are expected to be primarily

                                        17
page

for internal development and exploration of oil and gas properties and plant and
pipeline expenditures capital expenditures are expected to be funded from
internal cash flows

     in october 2001 the company announced its intent to sell certain noncore
nonstrategic properties in order to improve the overall quality of its
portfolio as a result in december 2001 the company recorded a pretax
impairment charge of 184 million 116 million after tax primarily related to
these properties resulting in net properties held for sale of 338 million and
related restructuring liabilities of 10 million the 10 million restructuring
liability is related to severance and other exit costs and is included in
accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2001 the
held for sale properties are expected to be sold in 2002 the company expects to
use the proceeds from property sales to repay debt

marketing

  north america usa and canada

     the companys marketing strategy is to maximize the value of its production
by developing marketing flexibility from the wellhead to its ultimate sale the
companys natural gas production is gathered processed exchanged and
transported utilizing various firm and interruptible contracts and routes to
access higher value market hubs the companys customers include local
distribution companies electric utilities industrial users and marketers the
company maintains the capacity to ensure its production can be marketed either
at the wellhead or downstream at market sensitive prices

     all of the companys crude oil production is sold to third parties at the
wellhead or transported to market hubs where it is sold or exchanged ngls are
typically sold at field plants or transported to market hubs and sold to third
parties downgrades or the inability of the companys customers to maintain
their credit rating or credit worthiness could result in an increase in the
allowance for unrecoverable receivables from natural gas ngls or crude oil
revenues or it could result in a change in the companys assumption process of
evaluating collectibility based on situations regarding specific customers and
applicable economic conditions

  other international

     the companys other international production is marketed to third parties
either directly by the company or by the operators of the properties production
is sold at the platforms or local sales points based on spot or contract prices

commodity risk

     substantially all of the companys crude oil ngls and natural gas
production is sold on the spot market or under shortterm contracts at market
sensitive prices spot market prices for domestic crude oil and natural gas are
subject to volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures market including
among others the new york mercantile exchange nymex quality differentials
worldwide political developments and the actions of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries also affect crude oil prices

     there is also a difference between the nymex futures contract price for a
particular month and the actual cash price received for that month in a us
producing basin or at a us market hub which is referred to as the basis
differential

     on january 1 2001 the company adopted sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas no 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities it requires enterprises to recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value the requisite accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation

     in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 133 the company
recorded a netoftax cumulativeeffecttype adjustment of 366 million loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments the company

                                        18
page

recorded cash flow hedge derivatives liabilities of 582 million 361 million
after tax and 3 million after tax was recorded in current earnings as a
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle the company
reclassified as reductions to earnings during 2001 322 million 200 million
after tax from the transition adjustment that was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income

     the company utilizes overthecounter price and basis swaps as well as
options to hedge its production in order to decrease its price risk exposure
the gains and losses realized as a result of these price and basis derivative
transactions are substantially offset when the hedged commodity is delivered in
order to accommodate the needs of its customers the company also uses price
swaps to convert natural gas sold under fixed price contracts to market
sensitive prices

     the company uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the
hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of crude oil and natural
gas may have on the fair value of the companys derivative instruments for
example at december 31 2001 the potential decrease in fair value of
derivative instruments assuming a 10 percent adverse movement an increase in
the underlying commodities prices would result in a 72 million decrease in the
net unrealized gain the derivative instruments in place at december 31 2001
hedged approximately 22 percent of the companys projected production volumes
through 2002

     for purposes of calculating the hypothetical change in fair value the
relevant variables include the type of commodity the commodity futures prices
the volatility of commodity prices and the basis and quality differentials the
hypothetical change in fair value is calculated by multiplying the difference
between the hypothetical price adjusted for any basis or quality differentials
and the contractual price by the contractual volumes as more fully described in
note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company periodically
assesses the effectiveness of its derivative instruments in achieving offsetting
cash flows attributable to the risks being hedged changes in basis
differentials or notional amounts of the hedged transactions could cause the
derivative instruments to fail the effectiveness test and result in the markto
market accounting for the affected derivative transactions which would be
reflected in the companys current period earnings

  credit and market risks

     the company manages and controls market and counterparty credit risk
through established formal internal control procedures which are reviewed on an
ongoing basis the company attempts to minimize credit risk exposure to
counterparties through formal credit policies monitoring procedures and if
necessary through establishment of valuation reserves related to counterparty
credit risk in the normal course of business collateral is not required for
financial instruments with credit risk historically the company has suffered
minimal losses from credit risk

oil and gas reserves

     the process of estimating quantities of natural gas ngls and crude oil
reserves is very complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of
all available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data
for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of
numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity
evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of
production under varying economic conditions as a result material revisions to
existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every
reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent
the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances
in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise
than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures as
described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company
uses the unitsofproduction method to amortize its oil and gas properties
changes in reserve quantities as described above will cause corresponding
changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision see
the supplementary financial information for reserve data

carrying value of longlive assets

     as more fully described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial
statements the company performs an impairment analysis whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be
recoverable cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based
upon managements estimates of proved oil ngls and gas reserves future oil
ngls and gas prices and costs to extract these reserves downward revisions in
estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates or depressed
oil ngls and gas prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying amounts
of its properties as described in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial
statements the company recorded a pretax impairment charge of 184 million and
225 million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 1999 respectively

natural gas measurement

     the company records estimated amounts for natural gas revenues and natural
gas purchase costs based on volumetric calculations under its natural gas sales
and purchase contracts variances or imbalances resulting from such calculations
are inherent in natural gas sales production operations measurement and
administration management does not believe that differences between actual and
estimated natural gas revenues or purchase costs attributable to the unresolved
variances or imbalances are material

foreign currency risk

     the companys reported cash flows related to canadian operations is based
on cash flows measured in canadian dollars and converted to the us dollar
equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates
for the period reported the companys canadian subsidiaries have no financial
obligations that are denominated in us dollars

dividends

     on january 9 2002 the board of directors declared a common stock
quarterly cash dividend of 1375 per share payable april 1 2002 to
shareholders of record on march 8 2002 dividend levels are determined by the
board of directors based on profitability capital expenditures financing and
other factors the company declared cash dividends on common stock totaling
approximately 113 million during 2001

results of operations

  year ended december 31 2001 compared with year ended december 31 2000

     the company reported net income of 561 million or 270 diluted earnings
per common share in 2001 compared to net income of 675 million or 312 diluted
earnings per common share in 2000 net income in 2001 included a noncash after
tax charge of 116 million or 56 per diluted share primarily related to the
impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale the company evaluates the
impairment of its oil and gas properties on a fieldbyfield basis whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not
be recoverable in december 2001 primarily as a result of the companys
decision to exit the gulf of mexico shelf and divest of certain other
properties the company recognized a pretax charge of 184 million 116 million
after tax related to those properties the company also recognized a 6 million
after tax restructuring charge or 03 per share related to severance and other
exit costs net income in 2001 also included an after tax gain of 12 million or
06 per diluted share consisting of ineffectiveness of cashflow and fairvalue
hedges and gains on derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge
accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the
company adopted sfas no 133 effective january 1 2001 for more discussion of
sfas no 133 see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements the
results of operations for 2001 include one month of activities related to the
canadian hunter exploration ltd hunter acquisition

     to reflect the change in the characteristics of its oil and gas properties
in 2001 the company began reporting its production volumes and reserves in
three streams natural gas crude oil and ngls under this

                                        20
page

methodology gas production is reported after extracting liquids and eliminating
nonhydrocarbon gases from the natural gas stream this change had no financial
impact and no material impact on total equivalent production volumes amounts
for prior years have been reclassified to conform to current presentation

     revenues increased 179 million to 3326 million in 2001 compared to
3147 million in 2000 revenues in 2001 increased 267 million compared to 2000
as a result of higher gas prices partially offset by lower oil and ngl prices
including a 48 realized loss per mcf related to hedging activities average
gas prices increased 57 per mcf in 2001 to 394 per mcf from 337 per mcf in
2000 which increased revenues 362 million the increase in revenues related to
higher gas prices was partially offset by a reduction in revenues due to lower
average oil and ngl prices including a 110 realized loss per barrel related
to hedging activities average oil prices decreased 199 per barrel in 2001 to
2345 per barrel from 2544 per barrel in 2000 resulting in reduced revenues
of 47 million average ngl prices decreased 279 per barrel in 2001 to 1435
per barrel from 1714 per barrel in 2000 resulting in reduced revenues of 48
million

     a decline in oil sales volumes resulted in a decrease in revenues of 107
million in 2001 compared to 2000 oil sales volumes decreased 105 mbbls per day
in 2001 to 632 mbbls per day from 737 mbbls per day in 2000 reducing revenues
100 million gas sales volumes were the same as the prior year at 1724 mmcf
per day however due to one less day in 2001 compared to 2000 gas revenues
were down 6 million ngl sales volumes decreased slightly to 471 mbbls per day
in 2001 from 472 mbbls per day in 2000 resulting in a reduction in revenues of
1 million oil sales volumes decreased primarily due to natural production
declines and reduced capital spending in the gulf coast and midcontinent areas
and property sales in 2000 although total gas sales volumes were the same as
the prior year sales volumes were higher in canada and east irish sea gas
sales volumes were higher in canada due to a successful drilling program and the
hunter acquisition and east irish sea was higher due to an additional interest
acquired in the area these increases were offset primarily due to lower sales
volumes in the san juan gulf of mexico and south louisiana areas gas sales
volumes were lower in these areas due to lower capital spending in the gulf of
mexico and natural declines in the other areas revenues in 2001 also included a
19 million gain related to ineffectiveness of cashflow and fairvalue hedges
and gains on derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting

     costs and expenses were 2241 million in 2001 compared to 1956 million
in 2000 costs and expenses for 2001 included a 184 million charge primarily
related to the impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale and a
restructuring charge of 10 million for severance and other exit costs
excluding the 194 million charges in 2001 costs and expenses increased 91
million the increase was primarily due to a 35 million increase in production
and processing expenses a 26 million increase in depreciation depletion and
amortization dda a 21 million increase in exploration costs a 9 million
increase in transportation expense and an 8 million increase in taxes other
than income taxes production and processing expenses increased primarily due to
higher workover expense higher service electrical and lease fuel costs dda
increased due to a higher unitofproduction rates related to changes in
production mix and higher finding costs exploration costs increased primarily
due to higher drilling rig expenses of 29 million and higher exploratory dry
hole costs of 28 million partially offset by lower geological and geophysical
gg expenses of 23 million and lower lease impairment charges of 16
million transportation expense increased primarily due to higher tariffs and
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to higher oil and gas
revenues

     interest expense was 190 million in 2001 compared to 197 million in 2000
the decrease was primarily due to higher capitalized interest during 2001

     other expense income  net was income of 12 million in 2001 compared to
expense of 27 million in 2000 this increase was primarily due to higher
interest income in 2001 as a result of excess cash on hand during the year
higher gains on sale of nonoil and gas assets and lower interest expense
related to tax matters

     income tax expense was 349 million in 2001 compared to 292 million in
2000 the increase in tax expense was primarily due to lower tax benefits
related to section 29 credits and taxaccrual adjustments partially offset by
lower tax on 2001 pretax income the section 29 tax credits were 24 million in
2001 compared to 52 million in 2000 favorable taxaccrual adjustments were 21
million in 2001 compared to 56 million in 2000 primarily related to prior
period activity

loss per common share in 1999 the 1999 results included a noncash after tax
charge of 140 million or 65 per share related to the impairment of oil and
gas properties in the fourth quarter of 1999 the company determined that there
would be performance related downward reserve adjustments associated with
certain properties located on the gulf of mexico shelf and in the permian basin
as a result the company recognized a pretax impairment charge of 225 million
140 million after tax related to those properties the company also
recognized a 26 million after tax charge or 12 per share related to severance
and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of poco petroleums ltd
acquisition

     revenues increased 834 million to 3147 million in 2000 compared to
2313 million in 1999 revenues in 2000 increased 950 million compared to 2000
as a result of higher commodity prices including a 45 realized loss per mcf

1079 per barrel in 1999 increasing revenues 109 million

     a decline in oil and gas sales volumes partially offset by an increase in
ngl sales volumes resulted in a decrease in revenues of 105 million in 2000

decrease in revenues as a result of lower oil and gas sales volumes were
partially offset by an increase in ngl sales volumes of 14 mbbls per day in
2000 to 472 mbbls per day from 458 mbbls per day in 1999 resulting in
increased revenues of 6 million oil sales volumes decreased primarily due to
natural production declines in the gulf coast area

     costs and expenses were 1956 million in 2000 compared to 2113 million
in 1999 costs and expenses in 1999 included a 225 million charge related to
the impairment of oil and gas properties and also a charge of 37 million
related to severance and transaction costs associated with the acquisition
excluding the 262 million of charges in 1999 costs and expenses in 2000
increased 105 million compared to 1999 the increase was primarily due to a 73
million increase in dda a 27 million increase in taxes other than income
taxes and an 11 million increase in exploration costs partially offset by an 8
million decrease in transportation expenses dda increased primarily due to a
higher unit rate resulting from a change in production mix taxes other than
income taxes increased primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues exploration
costs increased primarily due to higher lease impairment expense of 19 million
and higher exploratory dry hole costs of 7 million partially offset by lower
gg expense of 15 million transportation expenses decreased due to lower
canadian production

     interest expense was 197 million in 2000 compared to 211 million in 1999
the decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding fixedrate debt partially
offset by higher commercial paper borrowings during 2000

     other expense income  net was an expense of 27 million in 2000
compared to expense of 2 million in 1999 this increase is primarily due to
foreign currency transaction losses and other miscellaneous expenses partially
offset by interest income related to the settlement of a windfall profits tax
matter

     income taxes were an expense of 292 million in 2000 compared to a benefit
of 3 million in 1999 the increase in tax expense was primarily due to higher
pretax income resulting in higher income taxes of 342 million higher state
taxes of 21 million and higher foreign taxes in excess of the us statutory
rate of 35 million partially offset by tax benefits resulting from section 29
tax credits and taxaccrual adjustments the section 29 tax credits were 52
million in 2000 compared to 2 million in 1999 taxaccrual adjustments were
also 52 million in 2000 primarily related to prior period activity

  acquisitions

     on october 8 2001 br and hunter entered into an agreement pursuant to
which br agreed to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of
hunter for cash consideration of c53 per share representing an aggregate value
of approximately us 21 billion resulting in an excess purchase price of
approximately 793 million which has been reflected as goodwill on december 5
2001 the transaction was consummated this acquisition was funded with cash on
hand and proceeds from the issuances of 15 billion of fixedrate notes and
400 million of commercial paper the transaction was accounted for under the
purchase method in accordance with sfas no 141 see note 2 of notes to
consolidated financial statements for more information related to this
transaction

     during the first quarter of 2001 the company purchased from difco limited
an additional 10 percent interest in 7 fields in the east irish sea for 25
million the company is the operator of the properties and now owns 100 percent
of the assets

     in january 2001 the companys canadian subsidiary burlington resources
canada energy ltd now known as burlington resources canada ltd brcl
acquired approximately 37 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent bcfe of
proved reserves from petrobank energy and resources ltd for 57 million

     in december 2001 the alberta energy and utility board approved the
application by atco gas pipelines ltd a regulated gas utility to sell
properties in the vikingkinsella area of alberta canada to brcl for
approximately 346 million the properties have net proved reserves of
approximately 251 bcfe the transaction was consummated on january 3 2002

  legal proceedings

     the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as
defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims
act these lawsuits have been consolidated by the united states judicial panel
on multidistrict litigation for pretrial proceedings in the matter of in re
natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united states district court
for the district of wyoming mdl1293 the plaintiffs contend that defendants
underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on federal and indian lands
through the use of belowmarket prices improper deductions improper
measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies plaintiffs
allege that the royalties paid by defendants were lower than the royalties
required to be paid under federal regulations and that the forms filed by
defendants with the minerals management service mms reporting these royalty
payments were false thereby violating the civil false claims act the united
states has intervened in certain of the mdl1293 cases as to some of the
defendants including the company

     various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the
united states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of
natural gas produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general
these proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the companys royalty payments
over various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant
federal regulations

     based on the companys present understanding of the various governmental
and false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it
has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such
defenses however in the event that the company is found to have violated the
civil false claims act the company could be subject to monetary damages and a
variety of sanctions including double damages substantial monetary fines
civil penalties and a temporary suspension from entering into future federal
mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time while
the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through
settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position of the company although results of operations
and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which
such matters are resolved

     the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal
netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no
98854 in the court of appeal in the hague in the netherlands plaintiffs who
are working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that
                                        23
page

the company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger
field in the l16a block unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly
enriched by producing part of the oil from the adjoining q1 block the
plaintiffs claim that the defendants infringed upon plaintiffs right to produce
the minerals present in its license area and acted in violation of generally
accepted standards by failing to inform plaintiffs of the overlap of the logger
field into the q1 block for all relevant periods the company owned a 375
working interest in the logger field following a trial the district court in
the hague rendered a judgment in favor of the defendants including the company
dismissing all claims plaintiffs thereafter appealed on october 19 2000 the
court of appeal in the hague issued an interim judgment in favor of the
plaintiffs and ordered that additional evidence be presented to the court
relating to issues of both liability and damages the company and the other
defendants are continuing to vigorously assert defenses against these claims
the company has also asserted claims of indemnity against two of the defendants
from whom it had acquired a portion of its working interest share the company
is unable at this time to reasonably predict the outcome or in the event of an
unfavorable outcome to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss
if any in this lawsuit

     in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental
and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the
outcome of these other lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes these other matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations or
cash flows of the company

other matters

  recent accounting pronouncements

     the following sfass were issued in june 2001 sfas no 141 business
combinations sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no
143 accounting for asset retirement obligations in august 2001 sfas no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets was also issued
sfas no 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all
business combinations applies to all business combinations initiated after june
30 2001 and to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method
that are completed after june 30 2001 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill as
well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized but be
tested annually for impairment and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
december 15 2001 sfas no 141 and no 142 apply to the companys accounting
for the acquisition of hunter the company is in the process of evaluating the
impairment methodology for goodwill

     sfas no 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a
corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset
subsequently the asset retirement cost should be allocated to expense using a
systematic and rational method sfas no 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2002 sfas no 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of longlived assets and longlived assets to be
disposed of it supersedes with exceptions sfas no 121 accounting for the
impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of and
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 the company is
currently assessing the impact of sfas no 143 and no 144 and therefore at
this time cannot reasonably estimate the effect of these statements on its
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

forwardlooking statements

     the company in discussions of its future plans expectations objectives
and anticipated performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the
securities and exchange commission or documents incorporated by reference
therein may include projections or other forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 or section 21e of the
securities exchange act of 1934 as amended such projections and
forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions which the company believes
are reasonable but are by their nature inherently uncertain in all cases
there can be no assurance

                                        24
page

that such assumptions will prove correct or that projected events will occur
and actual results could differ materially from those projected some of the
important factors that could cause actual results to differ from any such
projections or other forwardlooking statements follow

     changes in crude oil ngl and natural gas prices including basis
differentials from those assumed in preparing projections and forwardlooking
statements could cause the companys actual financial results to differ
materially from projected financial results and can also impact the companys
determination of proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows relative to crude oil ngl and natural gas reserves in
addition periods of sharply lower commodity prices could affect the companys
production levels andor cause it to curtail capital spending projects and delay
or defer exploration exploitation or development projects

     projections relating to the price received by the company for natural gas
and ngls also rely on assumptions regarding the availability and pricing of
transportation to the companys key markets in particular the company has
contractual arrangements for the transportation of natural gas from the san juan
basin eastward to eastern and midwestern markets or to market hubs in texas
oklahoma and louisiana the natural gas price received by the company could be
adversely affected by any constraints in pipeline capacity to serve these
markets

     exploration and production risks the companys business is subject to all
of the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and
development and production of crude oil ngls and natural gas

     reserves which require the use of improved recovery techniques for
production are included in proved reserves if supported by a successful pilot
project or the operation of an installed program the process of estimating
quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and involves subjective
engineering and economic determinations in this regard changes in the economic
conditions including commodity prices or operating conditions including
without limitation exploration development and production costs and expenses
and drilling results from exploration and development activity could cause the
companys estimated proved reserves or production to differ from those included
in any such forwardlooking statements or projections

     projecting future crude oil ngl and natural gas production is imprecise
producing oil and gas reservoirs eventually have declining production rates
projections of production rates rely on certain assumptions regarding historical
production patterns in the area or formation tests for a particular producing
horizon actual production rates could differ materially from such projections
production rates depend on a number of additional factors including commodity
prices market demand and the political economic and regulatory climate

     another major factor affecting the companys production is its ability to
replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through acquisition exploration
or development programs exploration success is extremely difficult to predict
with certainty particularly over the short term where the timing and extent of
successful results vary widely over the long term the ability to replace
reserves depends not only on the companys ability to locate crude oil ngl and
natural gas reserves but on the cost of finding and developing such reserves
moreover development of any particular exploration or development project may
not be justified because of the commodity price environment at the time or
because of the companys finding and development costs for such project no
assurances can be given as to the level or timing of success that the company
will be able to achieve in acquiring or finding and developing additional
reserves

     projections relating to the companys production and financial results rely
on certain assumptions about the companys continued success in its acquisition
and asset rationalization programs and in its cost management efforts

     the companys drilling operations are subject to various hazards common to
the oil and gas industry including explosions fires and blowouts which could
result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells or formations
production facilities and other property and injury to people they are also
subject to the

                                        25
page

additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage
or loss from severe weather conditions

     development risk a significant portion of the companys development plans
involve large projects in algeria the east irish sea china wyoming north
dakota the gulf of mexico and other areas a variety of factors affect the
timing and outcome of such projects including without limitation approval by
the other parties owning working interests in the project receipt of necessary
permits and approvals by applicable governmental agencies the availability of
the necessary drilling equipment delivery schedules for critical equipment and
arrangements for the gathering and transportation of the produced hydrocarbons

     foreign operations risk the companys operations outside of the us are
subject to risks inherent in foreign operations including without limitation
the loss of revenue property and equipment from hazards such as expropriation
nationalization war insurrection and other political risks increases in taxes
and governmental royalties renegotiation of contracts with governmental
entities changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreignbased
companies currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other
uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the companys
international operations laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade
and taxation may also adversely affect the companys international operations

     the companys ability to market crude oil ngls and natural gas discovered
or produced in its foreign operations and the price the company could obtain
for such production depends on many factors beyond the companys control
including ready markets for crude oil ngls and natural gas the proximity and
capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities fluctuating demand
for crude oil and natural gas the availability and cost of competing fuels and
the effects of foreign governmental regulation of oil and gas production and
sales pipeline and processing facilities do not exist in certain areas of
exploration and therefore any actual sales of the companys production could
be delayed for extended periods of time until such facilities are constructed

     competition the company actively competes for property acquisitions
exploration leases and sales of crude oil ngls and natural gas frequently
against companies with substantially larger financial and other resources in
its marketing activities the company competes with numerous companies for gas
purchasing and processing contracts and for natural gas and ngls at several
steps in the distribution chain competitive factors in the companys business
include price contract terms quality of service pipeline access
transportation discounts and distribution efficiencies

     political and regulatory risk the companys operations are affected by
foreign national state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on
production changes in taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments
or governmental agencies price or gathering rate controls and environmental
protection regulations changes in such laws and regulations or interpretations
thereof could have a significant effect on the companys operations or
financial results

     potential environmental liabilities the companys operations are subject
to various foreign national state and local laws and regulations covering the
discharge of material into and protection of the environment such regulations
affect the costs of planning designing operating and abandoning facilities
the company expends considerable resources both financial and managerial to
comply with environmental regulations and permitting requirements although the
company believes that its operations and facilities are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations risks of
substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in crude oil and natural gas
operations moreover it is possible that other developments such as
increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and enforcement and claims
for damage to property or persons resulting from the companys current or
discontinued operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in
the future

be recoverable unamortized capital costs are reduced to fair value if the sum
of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the assets net book

  derivative instruments and hedging activities

     the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps
to hedge future crude oil and natural gas production in order to mitigate the
risk of market price fluctuations the company also enters into derivative
contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
on january 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended effective with the adoption of sfas no 133 all
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value if
the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the
gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings if the
derivative qualifies for hedge accounting the gain or loss on the derivative is
either recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of
the item being hedged for fair value hedges or deferred in other comprehensive
income to the extent the hedge is effective for cash flow hedges to qualify for
hedge accounting the derivative must qualify as either a fairvalue cashflow
or foreigncurrency hedge

     the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items
must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or
cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly
basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedging instrument
becomes ineffective the company assesses hedge effectiveness based on total
changes in the fair value of options used in cash flow hedges rather than
changes of intrinsic value only as a result changes in the entire fair value
of option contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until
the hedged transaction affects earnings to the extent such contracts are
effective gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to cash flow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged
until the related production is delivered adjustment to the carrying amounts of
hedged production is discontinued in instances where the related fairvalue
hedging instrument becomes ineffective the balance in the fairvalue hedge
adjustment account is recorded in income when the related production is
delivered if the company determines that it is probable that a hedged
forecasted transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the hedging
instrument are recognized in earnings immediately

amounts of hedged production are included in crude oil and natural gas revenues
and are included in realized prices in the period that the related production is
delivered gains and losses on hedging instruments which represent hedge
ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivative instruments which do not
qualify for hedge accounting are included in other revenues in the period in
which they occur the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from
operating activities

  earnings per common share

     basic earnings per common share eps is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares
outstanding for the period the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for computing basic eps was 207 million 216 million and 216 million
for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively diluted eps
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for computing diluted
eps including dilutive stock options was 208 million 216 million and 217
million for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively for
the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 approximately 4 million shares
attributable to the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the
calculation of diluted eps because the effect was antidilutive no adjustments
were made to reported net income in the computation of eps

  use of estimates

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period the most significant estimates pertain to proved oil ngl and
gas reserve volumes and the future development dismantlement and abandonment
costs as well as estimates relating to certain gas ngl and oil revenues and
expenses actual results could differ from those estimates

  legal proceedings

     the company and numerous other oil and gas companies have been named as
defendants in various lawsuits alleging violations of the civil false claims
act these lawsuits have been consolidated by the united states judicial panel
on multidistrict litigation for pretrial proceedings in the matter of in re
natural gas royalties qui tam litigation mdl1293 united states district court
for the district of wyoming mdl1293 the plaintiffs contend that defendants
underpaid royalties on natural gas and ngls produced on federal and indian lands
through the use of belowmarket prices improper deductions improper
measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies plaintiffs
allege that the royalties paid by defendants were lower than the royalties
required to be paid under federal regulations and that the forms filed by
defendants with the minerals management service mms reporting these royalty
payments were false thereby violating the civil false claims act the united
states has intervened in certain of the mdl1293 cases as to some of the
defendants including the company

     various administrative proceedings are also pending before the mms of the
united states department of the interior with respect to the valuation of
natural gas produced by the company on federal and indian lands in general
these proceedings stem from regular mms audits of the companys royalty payments
over various periods of time and involve the interpretation of the relevant
federal regulations

     based on the companys present understanding of the various governmental
and false claims act proceedings described above the company believes that it
has substantial defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously assert such
defenses however in the event that the company is found to have violated the
civil false claims act the company could be subject to monetary damages and a
variety of sanctions including double damages substantial monetary fines
civil penalties and a temporary suspension from entering into future federal
mineral leases and other federal contracts for a defined period of time while
the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through
settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position of the company although results of operations
and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which
such matters are resolved

     the company has also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit styled unocal
netherlands bv et al v continental netherlands oil company bv et al no
98854 in the court of appeal in the hague in the netherlands plaintiffs who
are working interest owners in the q1 block in the north sea have alleged that
the company and other former working interest owners in the adjacent logger
field in the l16a block

unlawfully trespassed or were otherwise unjustly enriched by producing part of
the oil from the adjoining q1 block the plaintiffs claim that the defendants
infringed upon plaintiffs right to produce the minerals present in its license
area and acted in violation of generally accepted standards by failing to inform
plaintiffs of the overlap of the logger field into the q1 block for all
relevant periods the company owned a 375 working interest in the logger
field following a trial the district court in the hague rendered a judgment in
favor of the defendants including the company dismissing all claims
plaintiffs thereafter appealed on october 19 2000 the court of appeal in the
hague issued an interim judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that
additional evidence be presented to the court relating to issues of both
liability and damages the company and the other defendants are continuing to
vigorously assert defenses against these claims the company has also asserted
claims of indemnity against two of the defendants from whom it had acquired a
portion of its working interest share the company is unable at this time to
reasonably predict the outcome or in the event of an unfavorable outcome to
reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any in this lawsuit

     in addition to the foregoing the company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in numerous other lawsuits and named parties in numerous governmental
and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business while the
outcome of these other lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty management believes these other matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations or
cash flows of the company

     the following table reflects estimated quantities of proved oil ngl and
gas reserves these reserves have been estimated by the companys petroleum
engineers the company considers such estimates to be reasonable however due
to inherent uncertainties estimates of underground reserves are imprecise and
subject to change over time as additional information becomes available to
reflect the change in the characteristics of its oil and gas properties in
2001 the company began reporting its production volumes and reserves in three
streams natural gas crude oil and ngls under this methodology gas production
and reserves are reported after extracting liquids and eliminating
nonhydrocarbon gases from the natural gas stream this change had no material
impact on total equivalent reserves or production volumes amounts for prior
years have been reclassified to conform to current presentation
