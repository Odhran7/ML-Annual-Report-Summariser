we continue to focus on technology initiatives to design develop and deploy nextgeneration media and content delivery platforms including sky q and now that deliver video content provide advanced search capabilities including through a voiceactivated remote control and provide access to and integration of certain other dtc streaming services these platforms and more recently sky glass leverage our global technology platform sky glass is a smart television that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the united kingdom with an operating system that provides a video service similar to sky q over a broadband connection eliminating the need for a satellite dish or settop box 

sources of supply and other operations 

programming 

our owned television channels and now streaming service include content both owned by us and licensed from third parties and nbcuniversal in some cases licenses are on an exclusive basis we have various multiyear contractual commitments for the licensing of programming primarily sports rights and exclusive entertainment content our most significant sports rights commitments include european football broadcast rights for premier league games through the 202425 season in the united kingdom and bundesliga games through the 202425 season in germany we also have broadcast rights to formula one through 2024 in the united kingdom and germany and through 2022 in italy english and wales cricket board cricket games through 2024 in the united kingdom and union of european football associations champions league “ucl” through the 202324 season in italy as well as nonexclusive broadcast rights to certain serie a games through the 202324 season in italy 

our most significant commitments for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with hbo paramount warner bros and nbcuniversal we also produce and air live news and sports programming and produce certain original programming through sky studios we are increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of our territories and sold to other markets we also are constructing a new studio production facility in elstree uk 

to offer video services in addition to our owned channels we license substantial amounts of programming from third parties the fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers that are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided we seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms such as through our on demand services mobile apps and our now streaming service 

other 

we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment including settop boxes wireless hubs and network equipment to provide our video and broadband services to residential and business customers we also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets and tablets that are sold to customers that receive our wireless services 

we offer directtoconsumer services to residential and business customers through our customer service teams customer service centers websites telemarketing and a limited number of retail stores as well as through advertising via direct mail 



television and the internet our home service group performs various tasks including installations servicing and upgrades of custom er premise equipment customers can use selfservice help and support and perform selfinstallations for certain services 

competition 

we compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media entertainment and communications services in europe for video services we compete with cable operators providers of both paidfor and freetoair programming other satellite television providers digital terrestrial television providers content aggregators home entertainment products companies and other suppliers and providers of sports entertainment news and information that deliver dtc and other ott streaming services for broadband and wireless services we compete with service providers making use of new fiberoptic networks telecommunications providers other internet service providers and companies developing new technologies and devices our competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of or developments in the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices product innovations new technologies or different value creation approaches we also compete with organizations that are publicly funded in whole or in part to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate 

our owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for onair and creative talent with other television networks and with dtc streaming and other ott service providers the market for content is very competitive particularly for sports rights where the cost for such content is significant 

we compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations digital platforms and all other advertising platforms similar to the competitive environment in our media segment the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in television viewership and the increasing number of entertainment choices available 



our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of comcast spectacor which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia pennsylvania and other business initiatives including sky glass and xclass tv which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 sky glass and xclass tv are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to sky q x1 and flex we sell sky glass televisions in europe with the united kingdom as the first market to consumers that also subscribe to sky’s video services xclass tvs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our xclass tv operating system 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations cable communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets this generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year 

revenue and operating costs and expenses comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense in our media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games and the super bowl in particular advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the olympic games operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in cable communications media and sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the united states is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in evennumbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising respectively revenue in media also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year advertising revenue in sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights such as the olympic games and the fifa world cup tm  

revenue in studios fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of films released in movie theaters on dvds and through various other distribution platforms including viewing on demand dtc platforms or ott service providers release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season we incur 



significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s exhibition in movie theaters content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees 

revenue in theme parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates theme parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the christmas holiday season 

sky’s results are also impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our dth and now streaming services including the start of the new european football seasons and the christmas holiday this generally results in higher net customer relationship additions and higher marketing expense in the second half of each year to attract new customers 

exclusive sports rights such as european football play a key role within sky’s wider content strategy in europe broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to fiveyear period this creates some level of cyclicality although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market certain of sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarters of each year 

legislation and regulation 

while all of our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations with some also subject to international laws and regulations the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and federal communications commission “fcc” regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the united states 

beyond the significant regulations summarized below legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete these legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different andor conflicting state requirements such as with respect to privacy and open internetnet neutrality regulations that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete 

legislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the biden administration particularly with respect to broadband networks for example congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives and may consider other proposals that address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new permanent open internetnet neutrality requirements federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services including broadband states and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services including broader regulation of broadband networks any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs in addition united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirements and risks affecting our businesses 



broadband 

our broadband services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments the fcc frequently considers imposing new broadbandrelated regulations such as those relating to an open internet and from time to time imposing new regulatory obligations on internet service providers “isps” such as us states and localities also consider new broadbandrelated regulations including those regarding governmentowned broadband networks net neutrality and connectivity during 



covid19 new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses we may also be subject to certain broadbandrelated commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding 

broadband deployment and adoption initiatives 

there have been and may continue to be broadbanddeployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level including as part of covid19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021 that could subsidize other service providers building networks within our footprint or potentially could subsidize expansion of our network to new areas we cannot predict how such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses 

in 2021 the fcc launched the federal emergency broadband benefit “ebb” program to provide a monthly discount toward broadband service for eligible lowincome households during the covid19 pandemic congress recently created the affordability connectivity program “acp” a new longerterm program that replaced ebb we participated in ebb and are participating in acp we cannot predict the extent to which eligible households will opt to use their acp benefit towards our broadband services 

open internet regulations 

various forms of open internet regulations can significantly affect our broadband services in 2017 the fcc reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a title ii “telecommunications service” under the communications act and classified it as an “information service” under title i in addition it eliminated its prior “net neutrality” rules prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content on the internet impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services “throttling” prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate “paid or affiliated prioritization” and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers’ ability to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers “general conduct standard” the fcc stated that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the federal trade commission “ftc” and it expressly preempted all state open internet laws in addition the fcc revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that isps disclose any blocking and throttling practices and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate against lawful content the ftc has authority to enforce these public commitments and the fcc has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule 

the fcc’s 2017 decision was challenged and in 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia largely upheld the fcc’s decision including the classification of broadband as a title i information service and repeal of its prior rules however it vacated the fcc’s express preemption of all state open internet laws but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a casebycase basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy or under other theories and precedent on implied preemption 

several states have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive orders that impose open internet requirements in a variety of ways and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing andor conflicting state regulations 

the fcc under the biden administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify it as a “telecommunications service” which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act under a title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rates speeds data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content applications and service providers including backbone interconnection arrangements any fcc action could impact state open internet initiatives and related legal challenges and also could prompt further litigation congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation 



municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of governmentowned networks although others may choose to ease or facilitate such networks much of the federal funding authorized in 2021 for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by governmentowned networks although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved areas and locations we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses 

video 

the video marketplace continues to become even more competitive particularly with dtc streaming and other ott service providers there are a number of laws and regulations that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” or cable operators such as our cable communications business and to cable networks and local broadcast television stations operated by nbcuniversal these laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete particularly against dtc streaming and other ott service providers which are not subject to these same requirements 

cable pricing and packaging 

while our video services including equipment and installation fees are no longer subject to rate regulation by the fcc certain state entities monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our services and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer and our billing practices we cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions 

cable franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity facilities and financial support for public educational and governmental access programming and other inkind contributions 

the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal and unreasonable renewal conditions we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise the fcc adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise andor fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other noncable services over franchised cable systems and that ruled that inkind contributions generally should be treated as franchise fees subject to a statutory cap on franchise fees of 5 of cable service revenue while the order was upheld by a federal appellate court that decision has been appealed to the us supreme court in addition several localities have attempted generally unsuccessfully to date to impose franchise fees on dtc streaming and other ott service providers 

program carriage 

fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage in addition cable operators and other mvpds in the united states are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc as well as in the courts and may be subject to new complaints in the future 



program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with dtc streaming and other ott service providers we currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis in “tiers” and in various cases individually we have been involved in program access disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services 

with respect to our broadcast television business every three years each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either must carry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the threeyear period from january 1 2021 to december 31 2023 all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent although we have reached retransmission consent agreements with almost all mvpds in the past there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreements under favorable terms or at all 

broadcast licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle the current television license renewal cycle began in 2020 and some of our licenses have been renewed although our licenses have been renewed in prior cycles there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

broadcast ownership restrictions 

the communications act and fcc regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station some of these limitations currently are under review at the fcc including the national television ownership limit the local television ownership limit and the prohibition on each of the four major broadcast television networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and local broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under 

fcc 5g spectrum proceedings 

the fcc also has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for licensed and unlicensed commercial services including new 5g services some of which has been or is in the process of being auctioned by the fcc because cable communications and nbcuniversal both use some of this spectrum to provide services they must transition their operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5g which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs 

voice 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations rural call completion customer equipment backup power robocall 



mitigation service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services one federal court of appeals in the 8th circuit has held that voip is an information service and preempted state regulation of voip and the us supreme court has declined to review that determination but that ruling remains limited to the seven states located in that circuit state regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level 

wireless 

we offer a wireless voice and data service using our mvno rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilitiesbased wireless carriers eg e911 services local number portability etc as well as certain state or local regulations the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos andor mobile broadband providers in the future which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally 



sky and certain nbcuniversal international businesses are subject to telecommunications and mediaspecific regulation described below in europe latin america and other international jurisdictions and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws such as competition consumer protection data protection and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate our international businesses are currently and may be in the future subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to sky’s operations including for example to maintain annual funding for sky news in an amount no lower than sky news’ 2017 fiscal year expenditures as adjusted by inflation until 2029 

platform services 

in the united kingdom sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide “epg” and conditional access “ca” services to other programming providers are on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms among other things so that those providers’ content is available on sky’s satellite platform via the epg on settop boxes sky also has voluntarily committed to the united kingdom’s communications regulator the office of communications or ofcom to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services sky is subject to similar epg and ca obligations in germany 

television channels and ondemand services 

sky and nbcuniversal hold a number of licenses and authorizations for their portfolios of television channels and ondemand services for example in the united kingdom sky’s channels are licensed and subject to various codes issued by ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels sky and nbcuniversal also hold various broadcast licenses in certain eu and other countries these contentrelated rules and regulations cover issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights media concentration and plurality television advertising the protection of children accessibility airtime for commercials and teleshopping sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising 

broadband and voice 

sky provides broadband and voice services in the united kingdom ireland and italy pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that thirdparty broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions material changes to these regulations could affect sky’s business as a provider of broadband services sky is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to telecommunications security including a uk law that requires providers to take certain measures with respect to potential security compromises sky is also subject to eu and other open internetnet neutrality regulations which prohibit the blocking throttling or discrimination of online content applications and services and require isps to disclose their traffic management throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts 





intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular unauthorized copying distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet through devices software and websites counterfeit dvds and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content although many legal protections exist to combat such practices the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial modifications to existing laws a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws in the united states or internationally to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

us copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals we also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute the cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems in addition the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations we cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay 

privacy and data security regulation 

our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers’ personal information in the united states the communications act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

the ftc generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices for example the ftc often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer information these enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection use or sharing of personal information we are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under 

in addition certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing explicit consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” gives california residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection use and sharing of “personal information” as well as rights to access delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them moreover all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach 

certain of our businesses are subject to the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” and the united kingdom’s data protection act 2018 “dpa” which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the european union and united kingdom respectively dpa gdpr and the member states’ legislation implementing the gdpr related rules regulating the privacy of electronic communications services and networks including “cookie” rules and various initiatives by regulatory authorities pursuant to these laws affect how we are able to process certain personal data for particular purposes what we must tell our customers about this processing and what controls our customers have over such processing 

privacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2021 for example new laws have been enacted in virginia and colorado which come into effect in 2023 and include many requirements similar to those in the ccpa for companies that collect personal information from consumers in those states in addition california voters approved a ballot initiative enacting the california privacy rights act “cpra” which updates the ccpa and establishes a new california privacy protection agency to oversee implementation and enforcement of the state’s privacy laws changes enacted in the cpra generally go into 



effect on january 1 2023 though several aspects of the law remain subject to further rulemaking legislation similar to the laws enacted in virginia and colorado is under consideration in many other states and various regulatory authorities are considering rulemakings around privacy and data collection we cannot predict how these changes to the laws will affect our business or whether any legislation or proposed rules currently under consideration will be enacted or adopted or what the impact of any such laws or regulations may be on our businesses 

state and local taxes 

some us states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act “itfa” prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges however some jurisdictions may challenge the itfa or the application of the itfa to our business or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by the itfa 

uk exit from the european union 

the telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to our business in the united kingdom is subject to greater uncertainty as a result of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union in 2021 the uk government signaled its intention of moving away from the eu’s approach in a number of policy areas increasing the possibility of greater divergence between the regulation of our uk business and our other european businesses over time we are not able to predict the extent of any such divergence at this point in time 

other regulations 

us states and localities and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including our studios and theme parks businesses accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring cable equipment pole attachments universal service fees regulatory fees public safety telemarketing leased access indecency loudness of commercial advertisements advertising political broadcasting sponsorship identification emergency alert system equal employment opportunity and other employmentrelated laws environmentalrelated matters our equipment supply chain and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations in addition our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the fcc and other federal state and local agencies as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 189000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 79000 74000 and 34000 were associated with cable communications nbcuniversal and sky respectively approximately 30 of these employees were located in over 30 countries outside the united states with larger workforce concentrations in the united kingdom china japan italy and germany we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business a small overall portion of our fulltime us employees are unionized outside the united states employees in certain countries particularly in europe are represented by an employee representative organization such as a union works council or employee association our employee numbers reflect additional employees in our theme parks both due to the opening of our park in beijing china and reversing temporary workforce reductions implemented in 2020 due to capacity restrictions and closures at our parks resulting from covid19

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

the impacts of covid19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways in particular covid19 has had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations for example as a result of covid19 we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions the creation and availability of our film and television programming globally also have been disrupted as a result of covid19 such as postponements or cancellations of sporting events theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production 

the impact of covid19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect daytoday life travel protocols and the length of time that such measures remain in place global economic conditions current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy it is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected 

covid19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below 

our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment sports news and information content to consumers there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 



below is a summary of the most significant sources of competition for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

• cable communications’ and sky’s broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies including many that are increasing deployment of fiberbased networks wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the united states that own and operate their own broadband networks and dbs and newer satellite broadband providers broadbanddeployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level including as part of covid19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021 may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint competition for cable communications’ video services consists primarily of dtc streaming and other ott service providers dbs providers and telecommunications companies with fiberbased networks sky faces competition for its video services from cable and telecommunications providers in its european markets our voice and wireless services primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable pricing which has increased competition 

• nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment sports news and information content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent popular content including sports programming and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses this competition has intensified as dtc streaming and other ott service providers seek to develop highquality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers 

consolidation of or cooperation between our competitors including suppliers and distributors of content may increase competition in all of these areas as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources greater efficiencies of scale fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production for example such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited datausage plans for internet or wireless phone services 

the ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers business partners employees investors and government authorities in addition our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models as consumers increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott services the number of cable communications’ video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to nbcuniversal’s television networks decrease even as cable communications’ broadband services have become more important to consumers dtc streaming and other ott services have driven and will continue to drive changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services and how much they pay for such content 

for example cable communications continues to experience net video customer losses in europe more of sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to now sky’s dtc streaming service instead of its traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying the x1 and sky q platforms flex developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at sky and cable communications and by offering peacock the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models 

the increase in dtc streaming and other ott service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers the use of dtc streaming and other ott services reduce traditional television viewership and coupled with timeshifting technologies such as dvr and on demand services have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels in addition as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky’s television channels or to peacock 



our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

cable communications nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors websites and search engines other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers such as from social media and video games audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service providers regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic conditions generally in addition advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media which can deliver targeted advertising their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership which many of nbcuniversal’s networks and some of sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of peacock advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect cable communications’ video businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communications segment and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis part of cable communications’ programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services cost management or other initiatives the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment’s results of operations 

moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of cable communications’ video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s and sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content for nbcuniversal including peacock and sky in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance in addition there can be no assurance that peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone dtc streaming service 

nbcuniversal and sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and at times we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content we also may be unable to license popular thirdparty content for nbcuniversal’s and sky’s television programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests for example content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own dtc streaming or other ott services forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis 

entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights for nbcuniversal and sky our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors 



including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of rights payments and the ability to secure distribution from impose surcharges on or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s cable television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers the number of subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable television networks has been and likely will continue to be reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers in addition nbcuniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers either “mustcarry” status in which we require the provider to carry the station without generating any compensation to us or “retransmission consent” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage including the amount of compensation if any paid to us by such provider sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers 

increasingly nbcuniversal and sky license their prior season and library content on thirdparty distribution platforms including to dtc streaming and other ott service providers if this programming does not attract sufficient viewers these providers may not distribute nbcuniversal’s or sky’s programming in addition at times we have opted to and expect that we may in the future not license certain popular owned content to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through peacock which would result in foregone licensing revenue 

for all of these types of arrangements nbcuniversal’s and sky’s ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms the inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses 

less favorable european telecommunications access regulations the loss of sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect sky’s businesses 

sky relies on various thirdparty telecommunications providers to deliver its video broadband voice and wireless phone services to its customers for example sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services in addition under the current regulatory regimes in the united kingdom ireland and italy sky accesses networks owned by thirdparty telecommunications providers to offer its broadband and phone services in many cases on regulated terms including price if there is a change in regulation in these markets the regulated terms could become less favorable moreover while sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms specific pricing terms are not regulated as a result if sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms it would adversely affect sky’s ability to compete and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates which would adversely affect sky’s businesses and results of operations 



our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our business operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for nbcuniversal’s businesses and certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation it also presents similar challenges for sky’s businesses including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties for example global supply chains in general have been and may continue to be disrupted as a result of covid19 if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliancerelated issues if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment products or services we need in a timely manner or at all or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage new technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways including affecting the demand for our products the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies in addition some companies and us municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations 



could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of flex and sky q settop boxes wireless gateways developing smart televisions using our technology platform and the operation of peacock there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures 

a cyber attack information or security breach or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information all of which could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations 

network and information systems and other technologies including those that are related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services are critical to our business activities in the ordinary course of our business there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systemsrelated events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design these incidents include computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks phishing attacks malicious social engineering and other malicious activities incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our thirdparty vendors such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design 

cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them some cyber attacks have had and in the future can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and thirdparty vendors’ systems and other technologies moreover as we also obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information due to the nature of our businesses we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form we also incorporate thirdparty software including extensive opensource software applications and data hosting and cloudbased services into many aspects of our products services and operations all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such thirdparty suppliers and service providers 

while we develop and maintain systems and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections the occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past and could in the future cause a variety of potential adverse business impacts these include degradation or disruption of our network products and services excessive call volume to call centers theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets disruption of the security of our internal systems products services or satellite transmission signals power outages and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ data equipment and reputation moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result in addition any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the united states and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company despite our efforts we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business reputation or results of operations 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions in the united states or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communications’ or sky’s services altogether this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as certain dtc streaming and other ott services or substitute services for broadband and voice services such as wireless and public wifi networks weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks in particular the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for outofhome entertainment experiences which may be limited by weakened economic conditions as well as natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks such as covid19 terrorist attacks or other similar events 



weak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms if at all could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate further inflationary pressures in the united states and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties including advertisers customers suppliers wholesale distributors retailers and content creators among others to satisfy their obligations to us 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives such as peacock in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt divert the attention of management from our current operations or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives additionally federal regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures political risks the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions tariffs sanctions and trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments additionally although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks including the british pound euro and japanese yen the use of such derivative instruments may n ot be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the united kingdom’s recent withdrawal from the european union referred to as “brexit” including financial legal tax and trade implications in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest as well as corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations moreover foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do busines s can be inconsistent and unpredictable which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense if any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations our businesses may be adversely affected 

natural disasters severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations 

our services products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events including natural disasters severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks terrorist attacks or other similar events such events have in the past caused and could in the future cause a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network products and services excessive call volume to call centers a reduction in demand for our products services and theme parks disruption of our internal systems products services or satellite transmission signals power outages and damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ equipment and properties these events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties products and services and could lead to litigation and fines including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result we expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business reputation or results of operations 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside 



candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses 

in addition nbcuniversal and sky depend on the abilities and expertise of onair and creative talent if we fail to attract or retain onair or creative talent if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

risks related to legal regulatory and governance matters 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

while all of our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our cable communications and broadcast television businesses in the united states in addition our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete these legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different andor conflicting state requirements such as with respect to privacy and open internetnet neutrality regulations that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete 

legislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the biden administration particularly with respect to broadband networks for example congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives and may consider other proposals that address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new permanent open internetnet neutrality requirements federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services including broadband states and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services including broader regulation of broadband networks any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs in addition united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights including patents employment and labor matters personal injury and property damage free speech customer privacy regulatory requirements advertising marketing and selling practices and credit and collection issues greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s writers directors actors technical and production personnel as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s 



collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition nbcuniversal’s media segment and sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

impacts of covid19 

covid19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways with the most significant effects in 2020 affecting the comparability of periods included in this report covid19 has had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports respectively we expect the effects of the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term although the extent of such 



impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures us and global economic conditions expanded availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to covid19 the following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses 

nbcuniversal

• delays to the start of seasons for certain professional sports leagues including the 202021 nhl and nba seasons resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year the delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast the timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021 in addition the tokyo olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs 

• our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity we delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity operations of many movie theaters worldwide caused by covid19 delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows results of operations in our studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of covid19 

sky 

• directtoconsumer revenue has been negatively impacted and future periods may be negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers ’ locations in addition delays to the start of the 202021 seasons for certain sports including european football resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year the timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021

percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm 

sky depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2021 primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency and increased amortization of software nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the opening of 



universal beijing resort in september 2021 cable communications depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions 

amortization expense from acquisitionrelated intangible assets totaled 24 billion 23 billion and 20 billion for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011 

consolidated interest expense 

interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 360 million of charges recorded in 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes compared to 204 million of charges related to early redemptions in 2021 as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding and lower weightedaverage interest rates 

consolidated investment and other income loss net 



the change in investment and other income loss net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to equity in net income losses of investees net related to our investment in atairos and realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net the income losses at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income loss of 18 billion 286 million and 64 million 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net in 2021 primarily included gains related to nonmarketable equity securities and losses on certain marketable securities compared to the prior year period which primarily included gains on nonmarketable securities

in 2021 the effective income tax rate included 498 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes enacted in the united kingdom in the second quarter of 2021 which among other provisions will increase the corporate tax rate to 25 from 19 effective april 1 2023 the rate change resulted in an increase in our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in income tax expense our income tax expense will reflect the new rate in the united kingdom in 2023 

in 2020 the effective income tax rate included 145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020 



the changes in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to losses at universal beijing resort which increased due to preopening costs prior to its opening in september 2021 see note 7 



our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use adjusted ebitda as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services one product two product and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one two or three or more of our services respectively for multiple dwelling units “mdus” including buildings located on college campuses whose residents have the ability to receive additional services such as additional programming choices or our hd video or dvr services we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional services the mdu is counted as a single customer residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system with certain offerings such as ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in certain temporary covid19 programs including an internet essentials promotion for new qualifying customers to receive 60 days of free broadband services this 60day free internet essentials promotional offer ended at the end of december 2021 customers under this program are excluded from our customer metrics until they begin paying for their service total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology resulting in a reduction of approximately 26000 customers there was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented have been recast on a comparable basis 



average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers as well as changes in advertising revenue while revenue from our residential broadband video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings we believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our highermargin businesses 



cable communications segment – revenue 

we are a leading provider of broadband video voice wireless and other services to residential customers in the united states under the xfinity brand we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising our residential and business customers are marketed individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate 

resi dential 

revenue from our residential customers includes amounts earned for providing our broadband video voice and wireless services including equipment and installation services broadband revenue also includes revenue earned related to our customers’ use of flex and streaming services and wireless revenue also includes the sale of devices revenue from each of our residential services is impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle franchise and regulatory fees billed to our customers are included with the relevant service which primarily relate to video and voice services 

broadband 

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential broadband customers the remaining increase in revenue was due to an increase in average rates average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to covid19 and the impacts of customer adjustments refer to “video” below for additional information 

we believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our broadband service and seek higherspeed offerings 

video 

revenue was flat in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers offset by an increase in average rates average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events for customers receiving bundled services the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle 

we expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns 

voice 

revenue decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers partially offset by increases in average rates 

we expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline 

wireless 

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines and device sales 

business services 

revenue from our business customers includes our service offerings for small business locations which primarily include broadband voice and video services as well as our solutions for mediumsized customers and larger enterprises and cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators 

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in average rates and an increase in the number of customers receiving our services which included the negative impacts of covid19 on small businesses in the prior year period

other 

revenue primarily relates to our security and automation services and also includes revenue related to residential customer late fees and related to other services such as the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers 

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in revenue from licensing of our technology platforms and from our security and automation services 



cable communications segment – operating costs and expenses 

programming expenses 

programming expenses which represent our most significant operating expense are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers these expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations 

expenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates and the impacts in 2020 of adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of covid19 these increases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers 

we expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of contract renewals which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers 

technical and product support expenses 

expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities costs for network operations product development fulfillment and provisioning the cost of wireless handsets tablets and smart watches sold to customers and monthly wholesale wireless access fees 

expenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving service partially offset by lower personnel costs 

customer service expenses

expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses

franchise and other regulatory fees 

expenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal state and local authorities including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements

other expenses 

expenses primarily include administrative personnel costs fees paid to thirdparty channels for which cable represents the advertising sales efforts other business support costs including building and office expenses taxes and billing costs and bad debt 

expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense 

cable communications segment – operating margin 

our operating margin is adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue we believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our highermargin businesses and improving overall operating cost management our operating margin was 437 421 and 401 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively while the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact adjusted ebitda they resulted in an increase to operating margins in 2020 











a segment details in the charts exclude the results of nbcuniversal headquarters and other and eliminations and therefore the amounts do not equal the total revenue and adjusted ebitda charts are not presented on the same scale

r evenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to continued audience rating declines at our networks and reduced spending from advertisers as a result of covid19 including as a result of the reduced number of sporting events partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold and advertising revenue in peacock following its launch in 2020 

distribution 

revenue includes the fees received from the distribution of our cable and broadcast television network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and from nbcaffiliated and telemundoaffiliated local broadcast television stations distribution revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the olympic games and subscription fees received from peacock subscribers 

 

revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 including the impact of our broadcast of the tokyo olympics excluding 522 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the tokyo olympics distribution revenue increased due to contractual rates increases increased distribution revenue at peacock and credits accrued in 2020 at some of our regional sports networks from fewer games played due to covid19 as certain of our distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur this increase was partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our networks 

revenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to declines in the number of subscribers at our networks and credits accrued at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games played by professional sports leagues due to covid19 partially offset by contractual rate increases

expenses increased in 2021 primarily due to costs associated with our broadcast of the tokyo olympics higher programming costs at peacock and higher costs related to other sporting events due to covid19 timing impacts 

expenses decreased in 2020 due to decreases in sports programming costs driven by decreases in the number of sports events as a result of the postponement and cancellation of events due to covid19 delays in airing of new programs and cost saving initiatives partially offset by higher programming costs at peacock 

other operating and administrative expenses 

expenses include salaries employee benefits rent and other overhead expenses 

expenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs related to peacock partially offset by cost saving initiatives 

expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreased costs associated with our digital properties and cost saving initiatives partia lly offset by increased costs related to peacock

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements including additional sales of content as production levels returned to normal in 2021 and a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on peacock in 2021 which more than offset the benefit from initial content licenses associated with the launch of peacock in 2020 revenue in 2021 also was negatively impacted by delays in theatrical releases due to covid19 for our film studios 

revenue increased in 2020 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements including initial licenses of content associated with the launch of peacock and increased sales of titles made available on demand including certain 2020 releases after theater closures due to covid19 partially offset by decreases in revenue from our television studios due to delays in production

a constant currency is a nongaap financial measure refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section on page 52 for additional information including our definition and our use of constant currency and for a reconciliation of sky’s constant currency growth rates 



customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of sky’s four primary services of video broadband voice and wireless phone service sky reports business customers including hotels bars workplaces and restaurants generally based on the number of locations receiving our services in the first quarter of 2021 we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in italy and germany which are counted as described above consistent with the methodology for customers in the united kingdom previously customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in italy or the number of active venues or rooms in germany this change resulted in a reduction in sky’s total customer relationships of 714000 as of december 31 2020 the impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material for comparative purposes we have updated sky’s historical total customer relationships and average monthly directtoconsumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment 



a constant currency is a nongaap financial measure refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section on page 52 for additional information including our definition and our use of constant currency and for a reconciliation of sky’s constant currency growth rates 

average monthly directtoconsumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by sky’s customers each of sky’s services has a different contribution to adjusted ebitda we believe average monthly directtoconsumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our directtoconsumer service offerings 

sky segment – revenue 

directtoconsumer 

revenue primarily relates to video services provided to both residential and business customers as well as broadband voice and wireless services video service revenue includes both dth video services and our now streaming service revenue from our wireless customers also includes the sale of devices 

revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency revenue increased primarily due to an increase in average revenue per customer relationship this increase reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of covid19 an increase in the sale of wireless handsets and rate increases in the united kingdom which were partially offset by declines in average rates in italy customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in italy were offset by increases in the united kingdom and germany the declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for serie a which we had held through the end of the 202021 season beginning with the 202122 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 202324 season we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in italy 

content 

revenue relates to the distribution of our owned television channels on thirdparty platforms and the licensing of owned and licensed content 

revenue decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency revenue decreased primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in italy and germany partially offset by higher revenue from the distribution of sky’s sports programming on thirdparty platforms due to the impacts of covid19 in the prior year period 



advertising 

revenue consists of the sale of advertising on linear television and digital platforms including where we represent the sales efforts of thirdparty channels as well revenue from various technology tools and solutions relating to our advertising business

sky segment – operating costs and expenses 

programming and production costs 

expenses primarily relate to content broadcast on our channels these costs include the amortization of owned and licensed programming including sports rights direct production costs production overhead and onair talent costs these expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties 

expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with serie a and entertainment programming in the current year period partially offset by an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to covid19 which delayed the starts of the 202021 european football seasons 

direct network costs 

expenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of broadband and voice services including wireless services for wireless handsets and tablets to our customers this includes call costs monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with our network in addition it includes the cost of wireless handsets sold to customers

revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at comcast spectacor as a result of the impacts of covid19 in the prior year period and sales of sky glass televisions 

expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to covid19 including severance charges related to our businesses partially offset by costs related to sky glass and xclass tv in 2020 our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives with the most significant relating to severance at nbcuniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base the costs of these initiatives were presented in corporate and other payments related to nbcuniversal employee severance were substantially complete in 2021 and the substantial majority of the related costs savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses as of the end of 2021 a portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives we expect to incur increased costs in 2022 related to the launch of sky glass and xclass tv 







percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm 

amounts represent eliminations of transactions between cable communications nbcuniversal sky and other businesses eliminations of transactions between nbcuniversal are presented separately current year amounts reflect an increase in eliminations associated with the tokyo olympics refer to note 2 for a description of transactions between our segments 



consolidated adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities including the results of entities that we do not consolidate as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs additionally we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax expense investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance 

we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap 



a amounts represent the impacts of certain events gains losses or other charges that are excluded from adjusted ebitda including sky transactionrelated costs and costs related to our investment portfolio year to date 2020 also includes 177 million related to a legal settlement 



constant currency 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are nongaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations certain of our businesses including sky have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies as a result the comparability of the financial results reported in us dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our sky segment we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year 









our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to obtain future external financing refer to “contractual obligations” discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders 

we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements our commercial paper program provides a lowercost source of borrowing to fund our shortterm working capital requirements as of december 31 2021 amounts available under our revolving credit facility net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 110 billion we entered into a new revolving credit facility in march 2021 see note 6 



we are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at comcast and certain of our subsidiaries including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreement governing the comcast revolving credit facility our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage which is the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility as of december 31 2021 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt the covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities including sky and our international theme parks 

operating activities 



the decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs including increased production spending offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021 as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue which included the impacts of our broadcast of the tokyo olympics these decreases were partially offset by increases related to the operations of our theme parks 

the decrease in income tax payments in 2021 was primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange refer to “financing activities” below for additional information which reduced tax payments by 13 billion in the current year period and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021 

the increase in proceeds from investments and other in 2021 was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments see note 8 

investing activities 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures which are discussed further below the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our investment in airtouch in 2020 the acquisition of masergy in 2021 and increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development partially offset by decreases in purchases of investments decreases in costs related to the construction of universal beijing resort and the purchase of spectrum in the prior year period 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were flat in 2021 primarily due to reduced spending in our theme parks segment as a result of covid19 offset by increases in spending in our cable communications segment the costs associated with the construction of universal beijing resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows see note 7 

our most significant capital expenditures are in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future cable communications’ capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2021 2020 and 2019 



we expect our capital expenditures for 2022 will be focused on the increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential in our cable 



communications segment and the continued deployment of wireless gateways x1 and sky q in addition we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks in the future including the development of our additional theme park in orlando florida which resumed in 2021 capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services the capacity required for existing services the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans dividend payments and payments related to the redemption of nbcuniversal enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities partially offset by proceeds from borrowings net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of crosscurrency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities 

in august 2021 we completed a debt exchange transaction we issued 150 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weightedaverage interest rate of 293 and made cash payments of 05 billion in exchange for 112 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weightedaverage interest rate of 504 the debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weightedaverage interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 027 and extended the overall weightedaverage maturity by 2 years the debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification and therefore following the exchange the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes 

in 2021 we made debt repayments of 115 billion including 49 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of 33 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025 as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction 

in 2021 we issued €175 billion 21 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance aggregate principal amount of fixedrate euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029 in 2021 we had borrowings of 06 billion under the universal beijing resort term loan 

w e have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions market transactions tender offers redemptions or otherwise see notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities 

share repurchases and dividends 

in the second quarter of 2021 we restarted our share repurchase program which had been paused since the beginning of 2019 effective may 25 2021 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to 10 billion during 2021 we repurchased a total of 732 million shares of our class a common stock for 40 billion in january 2022 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the 6 billion remaining as of december 31 2021 to 10 billion under the authorization which does not have an expiration date we expect to repurchase additional shares which may be in the open market or in private transactions 

our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling 46 billion in 2021 we paid dividends of 45 billion in 2021 in january 2022 our board of directors approved an 8 increase in our dividend to 108 per share on an annualized basis we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors 

the chart below summarizes our share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid in 2021 2020 and 2019 in addition we paid 674 million and 534 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our sharebased compensation plans

guarantee structure 

our debt is primarily issued at comcast although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt 





a nbcuniversal comcast cable and comcast holdings included within other debt subject to oneway guarantees are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec the guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section together with exhibit 22 satisfy these reporting obligations

oneway guarantees 

comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec 



comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of 138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by comcast holdings comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all of comcast’s senior indebtedness including debt guaranteed by comcast on a senior basis and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its nonguarantor subsidiaries for purposes of this comcast holdings discussion comcast cable and nbcuniversal are included within the nonguarantor subsidiary group comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full however the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of comcast holdings or all or substantially all of its assets comcast holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100 and approximately 37 of our equity interests in comcast cable and nbcuniversal respectively

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below see also notes 4 and 10 

valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights 

we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including cable franchise rights annually as of july 1 or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a morelikelythannot determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed 

goodwill 

goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates wh en analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

we performed qualitative assessments in 2021 for goodwill in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments the qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018 changes in projected future cash flows recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions including the effects of covid19 discount rates and changes in our market capitalization based on these assessments we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not 



required we performed a quantitative assessment in 2021 for goodwill in our sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired longlived assets over time given that the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recogn ition of an impairment charge 

cable franchise rights 

our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6500 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights 

for purposes of impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates w hen analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2021 we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018 the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions including the effects of covid19 discount rates and changes in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television content 

we capitalize costs for owned film and television content including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest as well as acquired libraries we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of 



ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast we recognize the costs of multiyear liveevent sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract 

capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis licensed content that is not part of a fil m group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel network or platform basis with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations which are tested on a daypart basis sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment when performing an impairment assessment we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimates of future cash flows which are supported by internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which primarily include crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program 

the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of 2 million in 2021 a decrease of 9 million in 2020 and a decrease of 49 million in 2019 interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt notional amount of our interest rate instruments effective rates and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2021 we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2021 plus the applicable borrowing margin 





a includes the effects of our fixedtofixed crosscurrency swaps which are discussed further below under the heading “foreign exchange risk management” 

b notional amounts are used to calculate the interest to be paid or received and do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts excluding accrued interest 

additionally we have a 52 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in march 2024 we entered into a series of variabletofixed interest rate swaps on 52 billion of this term loan with an average pay rate of 11 and an average receive rate of 09 estimated using december 31 2021 implied forward rates through the year of maturity as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the estimated fair value of the term loan was 52 billion for each period and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net liability of 29 million and a net liability of 155 million respectively 

see notes 1 6 and 8 for additional information 



we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states through sky and nbcuniversal and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of nonfunctional currency denominated assets liabilities commitments and forecasted nonfunctional currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of 80 billion and 81 billion respectively as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we use crosscurrency swaps as cash flow hedges for certain foreign currency denominated debt obligations with obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer crosscurrency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on 16 billion and 17 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt respectively as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate estimated fair value of crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a net liability of 53 million and a net liability of 45 million respectively 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations we have foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in the fair value of crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using foreign currency denominated debt was 82 billion and 103 billion respectively and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using crosscurrency swaps was 36 billion and 40 billion respectively as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate estimated fair value of these crosscurrency swaps was a net liability of 104 million and 376 million respectively the amount of pretax gains losses related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income loss were gains of 760 million in 2021 losses of 686 million in 2020 and gains of 343 million in 2019 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of december 31 2021 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10 shift in currency exchange rates inclusive of the effects of derivatives the results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2021 net income attributable to comcast corporation 





we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

competition 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models in particular consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes highspeed internet services more important to consumers in addition the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers this increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels 



competition for cable communications’ services consists primarily of phone companies with fiberbased networks and direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours 

highspeed internet 

cable communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services including 

• wireline phone companies and other providers of wireline internet service 

• wireless phone companies and other providers of wireless internet service 

• municipal broadband networks and power companies 

• satellite broadband providers 

phone companies such as att frontier lumen and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure farther into their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional dsl technology and are offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 

certain other companies have launched ftth networks that provide highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g and 5g which continues to be available only in limited locations wireless broadband services and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile and fixed wireless routers as well as wireless data cards numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of wireless and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

video 

cable communications competes with a number of different sources in the united states that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

• dbs providers including att’s directv and dish network that transmit satellite signals to substantially all us households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services 

• phone companies including att and verizon that have built and continue to build fiberbased networks that provide services similar to ours which overlap a substantial portion of our service areas and that in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services 

• dtc streaming and other overthetop “ott” service providers including 

◦ subscriptionbased services such as amazon prime video apple tv disney hbo max hulu and netflix that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming 



◦ virtual multichannel video providers who offer streaming services for linear programming that generally involve smaller packages of programming networks at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings 

• other providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve including those operating as franchised cable operators 

• satellite master antenna television systems that offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems and generally serve multiple dwelling units “mdus” office complexes and residential developments 

• other companies such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free overtheair programming as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products 

many of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions 

voice 

cable communications competes with wireline and wireless phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” and competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internetbased phone services 

wireless 

cable communications competes with national wireless phone service providers in the united states including att and verizon which offer wireless service on both a standalone basis or along with other services as bundled offerings as well as regional providers of wireless communications services 

business services 

cable communications primarily competes with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs and wide area network managed service providers these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and voip companies that target businesses of all sizes our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloudbaseddigital solutions 



cable networks and broadcast television 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks dtc streaming and other ott service providers local broadcast television stations home entertainment products payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content gaming products and other forms of entertainment news and information 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of content and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks dtc streaming service providers and local television stations the market for content is very competitive particularly for sports rights where the cost for such content is significant 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and dtc streaming and other ott service providers our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 



in addition nbcuniversal’s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

filmed entertainment competes for audiences for films and other entertainment content with other major studios and independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment the competitive position of filmed entertainment primarily depends on the number of films produced their distribution and marketing success and consumer response filmed entertainment also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films we also compete with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of films in theaters and on demand and the distribution of films on premium networks and with dtc streaming and other ott service providers 

theme parks 

theme parks competes with other multipark entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities to help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts in existing and new theme park attractions hotels and infrastructure including the new theme parks in beijing china and orlando florida 



sky competes with a broad range of companies engaged in media entertainment and communications services in europe for video services sky competes with cable operators providers of both paidfor and freetoair programming other satellite television providers digital terrestrial television providers content aggregators home entertainment products companies and other suppliers and providers of news information sports and entertainment that deliver dtc and other ott streaming services for highspeed internet and wireless services sky also competes with service providers making use of new fiber optic networks telecommunications providers other internet service providers and companies developing new technologies and devices sky’s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of or developments in the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices product innovations new technologies or different value creation approaches sky also competes with organizations that are publicly funded in whole or in part to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate 

sky’s owned channels compete for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers particularly for sports rights where the cost for such programming is significant 



cable communications cable networks broadcast television sky and peacock compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at the related networks stations or channels declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available including content from dtc streaming and other ott service providers online media and other digital sources in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations cable communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets this generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year 



revenue and operating costs and expenses comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect cable networks and broadcast television and the super bowl which affects broadcast television in particular advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the olympic games operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in cable communications cable networks broadcast television and sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the united states is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in evennumbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising respectively revenue in cable networks and broadcast television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year advertising revenue at sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights such as the olympic games and the fifa world cup tm  

revenue in filmed entertainment fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of films released in movie theaters on dvds and through various other distribution platforms including viewing on demand release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season content licensing revenue in cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

revenue in theme parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates theme parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the christmas holiday season 

sky’s results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our dth and dtc streaming services including the start of the new soccer seasons and the christmas holiday this generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses 

exclusive sports rights such as european soccer play a key role within sky’s wider content strategy in europe broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to fiveyear period this creates some level of cyclicality for sky although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market certain of sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year 

legislation and regulation 

while all of our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our cable communications and broadcast television businesses in the united states specifically the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and federal communications commission “fcc” regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the united states and these businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state and local authorities in addition our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate 

beyond any significant regulations summarized below legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete these legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different andor conflicting state requirements such as with respect to privacy and open internetnet neutrality regulations that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete 



legislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the 2020 us presidential election for example the us congress may consider proposals that address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internetnet neutrality requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiatives any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs in addition united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses with the change in administration tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21 any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize the significant legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses 



highspeed internet 

our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments the fcc frequently considers imposing new broadbandrelated regulations such as those relating to an open internet states and localities also consider new broadbandrelated regulations including those regarding governmentowned broadband networks net neutrality and connectivity during covid19 new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses in addition as an internet service provider “isp” we must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligations on isps 

open internet regulations 

various forms of open internet regulations can significantly affect our highspeed internet services in 2017 the fcc reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a title ii “telecommunications service” under the communications act and classified it as an “information service” under title i in addition it eliminated its prior “net neutrality” rules prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content on the internet impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services “throttling” prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate “paid or affiliated prioritization” and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers’ ability to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers “general conduct standard” the fcc stated that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the federal trade commission “ftc” and it expressly preempted all state open internet laws in addition the fcc revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that isps disclose any blocking and throttling practices and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate against lawful content the ftc has authority to enforce these public commitments and the fcc has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule 

the fcc’s 2017 decision was challenged and in 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia largely upheld the fcc’s decision including the classification of broadband as a title i information service and repeal of its prior rules however it vacated the fcc’s express preemption of all state open internet laws but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a casebycase basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy or under other theories and precedent on implied preemption 

several states have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive orders that impose open internet requirements in a variety of ways and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing andor conflicting state regulations 

the fcc under the new administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act under a title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rates speeds data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content applications and service providers including backbone 



interconnection arrangements any fcc action could impact state open internet initiatives and related legal challenges and also could prompt further litigation congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation 

broadband deploymentinfrastructure initiatives 

beginning in 2018 the fcc adopted a series of orders aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks over time these orders may have the effect of creating regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own we cannot predict the extent to which the fcc might adopt similar orders in the future whether such future orders would be upheld if appealed how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted or how such changes may affect our business 

there also have been and may continue to be broadbanddeployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level including as part of covid19 relief efforts that could subsidize other service providers building networks within our footprint or potentially subsidize expansion of our network to new areas we cannot predict how such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of governmentowned networks although some may choose to ease or facilitate such networks we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses 

video 

the video marketplace is quickly evolving and continues to become even more competitive particularly as new dtc streaming and other ott service providers enter the market at a growing pace there are a number of laws and regulations that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” or cable operators and to cable networks and local broadcast television stations these laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete particularly against new online providers which are not subject to these same requirements 

cable pricing and packaging 

while the vast majority of our video services including equipment and installation fees are no longer subject to rate regulation by the fcc certain state entities monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our services and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer and our billing practices we cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions 

cable franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity facilities and financial support for public educational and governmental access programming and other inkind contributions 

the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal and unreasonable renewal conditions we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise the fcc adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise andor fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other noncable services over franchised cable systems and ruling that inkind contributions are treated as franchise fees subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees of 5 of cable service revenue unless those contributions are expressly excluded by the communications act the order has been appealed and we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 

program carriage 

fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage in addition cable operators and other mvpds in the united states are prohibited from requiring as a condition of 



carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc as well as in the courts and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with dtc streaming and other ott service providers maine has enacted a law mandating retail a la carte distribution by cable operators that may have similar effects the maine statute has been appealed and is currently stayed by the courts but we cannot predict the outcome of that litigation we currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis in “tiers” and in various cases individually we have been involved in program access disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services 

with respect to our broadcast television business every three years each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either must carry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the threeyear period from january 1 2018 to december 31 2020 all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent the next threeyear period will commence on january 1 2021 for which elections were made by october 1 2020 all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent although we have reached retransmission consent agreements with almost all mvpds in the past there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreements under favorable terms or at all 

broadcast licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle the current television license renewal cycle began in 2020 although our licenses have been renewed in prior cycles there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

broadcast ownership restrictions 

the communications act and fcc regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station some of these limitations currently are under review in the us supreme court in addition each of the four major broadcast television networks  abc cbs fox and nbc  is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and local broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under 

fcc 5g spectrum proceedings 

the fcc also has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for licensed and unlicensed commercial services including new 5g services some of which has been or is in the process of being auctioned by the fcc because cable communications and nbcuniversal both use some of this spectrum to provide services they must transition their operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5g which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs 



voice 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations rural call completion customer equipment backup power robocall mitigation service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services one federal court of appeals in the 8th circuit has held that voip is an information service and preempted state regulation of voip and the us supreme court has declined to review that determination but that ruling remains limited to the seven states located in that circuit state regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level 

wireless 

we offer a wireless voice and data service using our mvno rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilitiesbased wireless carriers eg e911 services local number portability etc as well as certain state or local regulations the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos andor mobile broadband providers in the future which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally 



sky and certain nbcuniversal international businesses are subject to telecommunications and mediaspecific regulation described below in europe latin america and other international jurisdictions and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws such as competition consumer protection data protection and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate our international businesses are currently and may be in the future subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to sky’s operations including for example to maintain annual funding for sky news in an amount no lower than sky news’ 2017 fiscal year expenditures as adjusted by inflation until 2029 

platform services 

in the united kingdom sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide “epg” and conditional access “ca” services to other programming providers are on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms among other things so that those providers’ content is available on sky’s satellite platform via the epg on settop boxes sky also has voluntarily committed to the united kingdom’s communications regulator the office of communications or ofcom to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services sky is subject to similar epg and ca obligations in germany 

television channels 

sky and nbcuniversal hold a number of licenses and authorizations for their portfolios of television channels for example in the united kingdom sky is subject to various codes issued by ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels sky and nbcuniversal also hold various broadcast licenses in certain eu countries and nbcuniversal holds broadcast licenses in various countries for its international cable networks and must comply with rules and regulations covering issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights media concentration and plurality television advertising the protection of children accessibility airtime for commercials and teleshopping sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising 

highspeed internet and voice 

sky provides broadband and voice services in the united kingdom ireland and italy pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that thirdparty broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions material changes to these regulations could affect sky’s business sky is also subject to eu open internetnet neutrality regulations which prohibit the blocking throttling or discrimination of online content applications and services and require isps to disclose their traffic management throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts 





intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular unauthorized copying distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet through devices software and websites counterfeit dvds and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content although many legal protections exist to combat such practices the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial modifications to existing laws a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws in the united states or internationally to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

us copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals we also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute the cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems in addition the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations we cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay 

privacy and data security regulation 

our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers’ personal information in the united states the communications act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

the ftc generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices for example the ftc often partners with state attorneys general to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information these efforts may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection use or sharing of personal information we are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under 

in addition certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” gives california residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection use and sharing of “personal information” as well as rights to access delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them moreover all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach 

certain of our businesses are subject to the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the european union gdpr and the member states’ legislation implementing the gdpr affect our ability to process certain personal data moreover the outcome of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union discussed more broadly below could affect our ability to process certain data 

privacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2020 for example california voters enacted updates to the ccpa via a ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act “cpra” among other things the cpra creates an entirely new statelevel agency for overseeing consumer privacy issues changes enacted in the cpra generally go into effect on january 1 2023 though several aspects of the law remain subject to further rulemaking we cannot predict how these changes to the law will affect our business there are several federal and state legislative proposals that if enacted could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information including us we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and if so the impact of any such laws on our business 



state and local taxes 

some us states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act “itfa” prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges however some jurisdictions may challenge the itfa or the application of the itfa to our business or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by the itfa 

uk exit from the european union 

the telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to our business in the united kingdom may be subject to greater uncertainty as a result of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and the end of the transition period on december 31 2020 with the possibility of greater divergence between the regulation of our uk business and that of our other european businesses over time we are not able to predict the extent of any such divergence at this point in time 

other regulations 

us states and localities and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including our filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring cable equipment pole attachments universal service fees public safety telemarketing leased access indecency loudness of commercial advertisements advertising political broadcasting sponsorship identification emergency alert system equal employment opportunity and other employmentrelated laws environmentalrelated matters regulatory fees our equipment supply chain and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations in addition our international businesses are subject to various international regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the fcc and other federal state and local agencies as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 168000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 82000 49000 and 34000 were associated with cable communications nbcuniversal and sky respectively approximately 25 of these employees were located in over 30 countries outside the united states with larger workforce concentrations in the united kingdom japan italy and germany we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business a small overall portion of our fulltime us employees are unionized outside the united states employees in certain countries particularly in europe are represented by an employee representative organization such as a union works council or employee association 

as a global media and technology company we have a wide range of employees including management professionals technicians engineers call center employees theme park employees and a wide range of media talent and production employees given the breadth of our employee base we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations however we provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with inclassroom and online trainings onthejob experience education tuition assistance and counseling and financial counseling and literacy training we seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue including through employee engagement surveys and employee resource groups and continue to have a strong focus on diversity equity and inclusion initiatives 



we focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market taking into account the job position’s location and responsibilities we provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401k retirement plan in the united states with a company match have employee stock purchase plans in the united states united kingdom ireland and several other european countries where most of our fulltime and parttime employees can purchase our stock at a discount and offer a portfolio of services and tools to support our employees’ health and wellbeing we also generally grant awards of restricted stock units and stock options on an annual basis to a meaningful portion of our employees with over 18000 employees receiving such awards in 2020 

in 2020 in response to covid19 we committed over 500 million to support employees where operations were closed or impacted made work from home options as broadly available as possible and enhanced safety measures for customerfacing employees in response to the impacts of covid19 and the changing environment in which we are operating our businesses we also implemented temporary workforce reductions including employee furloughs at our theme parks and incurred severance at some of our businesses refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

the impacts of covid19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways while our cable communications results were strong in 2020 they were negatively affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people increasingly worked and learned remotely from home covid19 had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations during 2020 for example in late february we temporarily closed our theme park in japan and in midmarch we temporarily closed our theme parks in orlando and hollywood and although our parks in orlando and japan reopened with limited capacity in june 2020 our park in hollywood remains closed we cannot predict when the hollywood park will reopen if any reopened parks will remain open or estimate attendance levels at any of the parks we expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term the creation and availability of our film and television programming globally have been and will continue to be disrupted including as a result of the postponement or cancellation of sporting events such as the professional soccer hockey baseball and basketball leagues and the olympics theatrical closures and the suspension of entertainment content production we expect any continued deterioration of global economic conditions would result in lower advertising revenues and consumer spending across our businesses 

the impact of covid19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect daytoday life and the length of time that such measures remain in place to respond to covid19 further deterioration of the global economy and the widespread availability of a vaccine at this point it is impossible to predict such extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected 

covid19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below 



our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment news and information content to consumers some established dtc streaming and other ott service providers have become core competitors to our video services and more continue to enter the market at a growing pace 

for example 

• cable communications’ and sky’s highspeed internet services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies with fiberbased networks wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services certain municipalities in the united states that own and operate their own broadband networks and dbs providers competition for cable communications’ video services consists primarily of dbs providers phone companies with fiberbased networks and increasingly dtc streaming and other ott service providers and devices each of which typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours including bundled offers with highspeed internet services sky faces competition for its services from cable and telecommunications providers in its european markets many of which offer customers bundled services which has increased competition 

• nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent content including sports programming and other resources required to operate their businesses this competition has intensified as dtc streaming and other ott service providers seek to develop highquality programming to attract viewers 

for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

consolidation of or cooperation between our competitors including suppliers and distributors of content may increase competition in all of these areas as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources and efficiencies of scale who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production for example consolidation or cooperation between phone companies which are also wireless distributors and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited datausage plans for internet or wireless phone services 

the ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers business partners employees investors and government authorities our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

while we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses such as by growing highspeed internet services and business services and by investing in peacock as the media and entertainment landscape continues to rapidly evolve there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models as consumers increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott services the number of cable communications’ video customers and subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks decrease even as cable communications’ highspeed internet services become more important to consumers dtc streaming and other ott services have driven and will continue to drive changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services and how much they pay for such content 

for example in europe as more of sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to sky’s dtc streaming service instead of its traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our highspeed internet services for changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying the x1 and sky q platforms and flex which more easily aggregate content from linear ie traditional television channels and 



dtc streaming and other ott services for our customers and by launching peacock our dtc streaming service the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models 

the increase in dtc streaming and other ott service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers nbcuniversal’s revenue relatedly may be negatively impacted as traditional and virtual multichannel video providers which pay nbcuniversal fees based on their respective numbers of customers lose customers timeshifting technologies such as dvr and on demand services reduce viewership which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels consumers in many cases have multiple options for viewing the same content for example content may be available through traditional linear platforms on demand services or a dtc streaming or ott service which may also result in audience rating declines reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content in addition as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky’s programming channels 

our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

cable communications nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers such as from social media and video games audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service providers regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic conditions generally in addition advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which many of nbcuniversal’s networks and some of sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of peacock advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as through dtc streaming or other ott service providers or delayed viewing through dvr or on demand services might not be fully counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect cable communications’ video businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communications segment and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally cable communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services cost management or other initiatives the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment’s results of operations 

moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of cable communication’s video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s and sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our 



ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content at nbcuniversal and sky in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance we also are incurring significant costs to develop peacock and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering 

nbcuniversal and sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content we also may be unable to license popular thirdparty content for nbcuniversal’s and sky’s programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests for example they may launch dtc streaming or other ott services for their owned content forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers or they may license their content on an exclusive basis to certain of our competitors or rival dtc streaming or other ott service providers 

entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights for nbcuniversal and sky our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of rights payments and the ability of nbcuniversal to secure distribution from impose surcharges on or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers the number of subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks has been and likely will continue to be reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers nbcuniversal’s and sky’s ability to renew these agreements on favorable terms may be affected by recent industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms 

increasingly nbcuniversal and sky license their prior season and library content on third party distribution platforms including to dtc streaming and other ott service providers if this programming does not attract sufficient viewers these providers may not distribute nbcuniversal’s or sky’s programming and dtc streaming and other ott service providers may not license programming nbcuniversal or sky creates or license it at reduced rates in addition we expect not to license certain popular content and we may decide not to license additional owned popular content to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through peacock which would result in foregone licensing revenue 

nbcuniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor 

there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms the inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses 

less favorable european telecommunications access regulations the loss of sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect sky’s businesses 

sky relies on various thirdparty telecommunications providers to deliver its video highspeed internet voice and wireless phone services to its customers for example sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services in addition under the current regulatory regimes in the united kingdom ireland and italy sky 



accesses networks owned by thirdparty telecommunications providers to offer its highspeed internet and phone services in many cases on regulated terms including price if there is a change in regulation in these markets the regulated terms could become less favorable moreover while sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms specific pricing terms are not regulated as a result if sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms this would adversely affect sky’s ability to compete and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates which would adversely affect sky’s businesses and results of operations 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses and certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us it also presents similar challenges for sky’s businesses including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment products or services we need in a timely manner or at all or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions in the united states or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may 



discontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communications’ or sky’s services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as certain dtc streaming and other ott services or substitute services for highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks in particular the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depend on consumer demand for outofhome entertainment experiences which may be limited by weakened economic conditions as well as natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks such as covid19 terrorist attacks or other similar events 

weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt if our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected further a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms if at all and could increase the cost of our borrowings 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives such as peacock in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt divert the attention of management from our current operations or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives additionally federal regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures political risks the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions tariffs sanctions and trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments additionally although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks including the british pound and euro the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as “brexit” including financial legal tax and trade implications in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest as well as corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations our businesses may be adversely affected 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage new technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways including affecting the demand for our products the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability in addition some companies and us municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of flex and sky q settop boxes wireless gateways and the development of peacock there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures 



we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery and technology embedded in our products and services are critical to our business activities cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks information systems and other technologies network information systems and technologyrelated events including those caused by us such as process breakdowns security architecture or design vulnerabilities or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or power outages natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks such as covid19 terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services excessive call volume to call centers theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets a reduction in demand for our theme parks disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment data properties and reputation in addition severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future the occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties products services networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and in some cases provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our thirdparty’s information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulators in the united states and internationally to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities while we develop and maintain systems and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches we have experienced systemsrelated events and breaches in the past and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses 

in addition nbcuniversal and sky depend on the abilities and expertise of onair and creative talent if we fail to attract or retain onair or creative talent if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 



risks related to legal regulatory and governance matters 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

while all of our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our cable communications and broadcast television businesses in the united states in addition our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statues rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete these legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services and this trend likely will continue state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different andor conflicting state requirements such as with respect to privacy and open internetnet neutrality that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete 

legislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the 2020 us presidential election for example the us congress may consider proposals that address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiatives any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs in addition united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws and united states and foreign policymakers could enact new competition laws or regulatory enforcement options that could negatively impact our businesses with the change in administration tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21 any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights including patents employment and labor matters personal injury and property damage free speech customer privacy regulatory requirements advertising marketing and selling practices and credit and collection issues greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s writers directors actors technical and production personnel as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 



in addition nbcuniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television networks and sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba mlb and european football games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

2020 developments 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2020 

overall 

• covid19 materially impacted our 2020 results of operations while cable communications results were strong nbcuniversal and sky results experienced material negative impacts due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and the postponement of sporting events respectively 

• repaid 188 billion and issued 186 billion of longterm debt in 2020 ending the year with 117 billion of cash on hand this financing activity resulted in a reduction in the weightedaverage cost of debt due to the favorable interest rate environment and provides additional liquidity given the risks associated with the economic conditions caused by covid19 

cable communications 

• revenue increased 34 to 601 billion reflecting increases in highspeed internet wireless business services and advertising revenue partially offset by declines in voice video and other revenue 

• adjusted ebitda increased 86 to 253 billion 

• operating margin increased from 401 to 421 reflecting increases in revenue from highspeed internet and business services and decreases in losses in our wireless business  

• total customer relationships increased by 16 million total highspeed internet customers increased 20 million and total video customers decreased 14 million 

• capital expenditures decrease d 44 to 66 billion reflecting lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure 

nbcuniversal 

• total nbcuniversal revenue decreased 173 to 281 billion and total nbcuniversal adjusted ebitda decreased 285 to 63 billion driven by the impacts of covid19 

• cable networks and broadcast television segments revenue decreased 58 to 108 billion and 02 to 102 billion respectively reflecting decreases in advertising revenue partially offset by increases in content licensing revenue distribution revenue decreased at cable networks and increased at broadcast television 

• filmed entertainment segment revenue decreased 187 to 53 billion reflecting lower theatrical and other revenues as a result of theater closures due to covid19 partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue 

• theme parks segment revenue decreased 689 to 18 billion and adjusted ebitda decreased from 25 billion to a loss of 541 million reflecting the temporary theme parks closures due to covid19 

sky 

• sky revenue decreased 33 to 186 billion excluding the impact of foreign currency sky revenue decreased 42 due to decreases in directtoconsumer advertising and content revenues driven by impacts of covid19 

• sky adjusted ebitda decreased 370 to 20 billion excluding the impact of foreign currency sky adjusted ebitda decreased 376 primarily due to the decreases in revenue 

other 

• launched peacock our directtoconsumer streaming service that features nbcuniversal content which was made available to comcast customers in april 2020 and launched nationally in july 2020 

• corporate and other revenue increased 98 to 366 million primarily due to revenue generated from peacock 

• corporate and other adjusted ebitda losses increased from 880 million to 24 billion primarily due to severance charges and costs associated with peacock 

impacts of covid19 

covid19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways our cable communications results of operations were strong in 2020 despite having been affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people worked and learned remotely from home covid19 had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations during 



2020 primarily due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and disruption of professional sports seasons respectively we expect the impacts of the covid19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures further deterioration of the global economy and widespread availability of vaccines 

cable communications 

• our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming gaming and videoconferencing as customers worked and learned remotely from home 

• we incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by covid19 primarily during the first half of the year these costs included additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected to our services and compensation for certain personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations 

• beginning in march 2020 and continuing through june 2021 new qualifying customers for internet essentials our lowincome internet adoption program receive 60 days of free internet services we also implemented programs primarily during the second quarter of 2020 under which we elected to waive certain fees and to not disconnect internet voice or wireless services for customers for nonpayment and we are providing customers a variety of flexible and extended payment options as a result of these programs our customer metrics for 2020 do not include customers in the free internet essentials offer or certain highrisk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment the number of customers excluded from our customer metrics was highest as of june 30 2020 and these customers were excluded from second quarter net additions the number of such customers decreased in the third and fourth quarters as some of these customers either began paying for service resulting in customer net additions or disconnected and no longer receive service we expect the number of excluded customers to continue to decrease in future quarters 

• certain professional sports leagues were disrupted due to covid19 generally resulting in postponed or canceled matches and reduced schedules certain of our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks include contractual adjustment provisions if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur our programming expenses were reduced as a result of these provisions and our revenue was negatively impacted in similar amounts as a result of adjustments that we passed through to our customers in 2020 and continue to pass through in the first quarter of 2021 

• the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 have resulted in reduced demand for certain of our residential and business services and reduced spending from advertisers which have had and while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020 likely will continue to have negative impacts on our revenue over the near to medium term in addition we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables and we have incurred and may continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense 

nbcuniversal 

• the temporary closure of all of our theme parks had the most significant impact on our revenue and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2020 on a consolidated basis our parks in orlando and japan reopened with limited capacity in june 2020 while our park in hollywood remains closed we expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term and we cannot predict with certainty when the hollywood park will reopen if any reopened parks will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened parks in addition although we currently expect that universal beijing resort will open in 2021 we have delayed certain construction projects including the development of the epic universe theme park in orlando 

• the deterioration of economic conditions caused by covid19 resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend by our customers in the cable networks and broadcast television segments and while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020 we expect this trend to continue over the near to medium term there has also been and likely will continue to be an acceleration of subscriber losses at our networks 

• we incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations due to covid19 primarily during the first half of the year including at our theme parks and at our production studios 



• the postponement and cancellation of many sporting events and professional sports seasons caused by covid19 impacted our results of operations during 2020 since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast while professional sports leagues generally resumed and completed their seasons in the second half of 2020 some had reduced numbers of events for the remainder of the interrupted seasons certain of our sports programming rights agreements and distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur our distribution revenue was negatively impacted as a result of credits accrued relating to these provisions and the programming costs that we recognized as the remaining events occurred were also impacted in addition there have been and there may be in the future delays to the start of the current or upcoming seasons for certain professional sports leagues when or the extent to which sporting events will occur in 2021 will impact the timing and potentially the amount of revenue and expense recognition in addition the 2020 tokyo olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs 

• the creation and availability of our film and television programming in the united states and globally have been disrupted including from the suspension of studio production operations in the first half of 2020 our studio production operations have resumed at a limited capacity additionally with the temporary closure of many movie theaters worldwide we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films both domestically and internationally delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows we expect results of operations in our filmed entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of covid19 

sky 

• directtoconsumer revenue has been negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the disruption of professional sports seasons and future periods may be negatively impacted as a result of the reopening plans and the extent of reopening of our commercial customers while sporting events generally resumed late in the second quarter of 2020 and the interrupted seasons were completed there were delays to the start of the current seasons for certain sports including european soccer as a result significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized in 2020 covid19 continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of when or the extent to which sporting events will occur in future periods their broadcast is expected to impact the timing and potentially the amount of revenue and expense recognition 

• we temporarily suspended certain sales channels due to covid19 which negatively impacted net customer additions and revenue in the first half of 2020 our sales channels generally resumed operations in june 2020 

• covid19 has resulted in the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in europe intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment these conditions negatively impacted revenue in 2020 and while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020 we expect covid19 likely will continue to negatively impact advertising spend and consumer demand for our services in 2021 in addition there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables and we have incurred and may continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense 

we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives across our businesses that have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations certain costs incurred by our businesses in response to covid19 including severance are presented in corporate and other our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives with the most significant relating to severance at nbcuniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base we do not anticipate significant incremental costs to be incurred under these plans and payments related to nbcuniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in 2021 nbcuniversal employeerelated costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021 and a portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives 

global financial markets have been volatile and domestic and global economic conditions continue to show signs of material weakness at this point it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of covid19 to our businesses or the degree to which demand for our products and services or supply of key inputs to those products and services will be affected this uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses 

as of december 31 2020 we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information resulted in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our longlived assets and concluded no assessment was required refer to the critical 



accounting judgments and estimates section for discussion of our impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we will continue to evaluate the impacts of covid19 on our businesses including the impacts of overall economic conditions which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future 

liquidity 

although negatively impacted by the effects of covid19 we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows together with our existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing will be sufficient for us to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements in 2020 we issued 186 billion of longterm debt the proceeds of which were used to repay existing indebtedness and increase cash on our balance sheet in order to bolster liquidity and strengthen our financial position as a result of the increased uncertainty related to the duration and scope of the covid19 pandemic we also took actions to conservatively manage cash through reductions in costs and capital expenditures in 2020 we expect the timing of certain priorities may continue to be impacted such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and returning capital to shareholders and the delay of certain capital projects

corporate and other – revenue 

revenue primarily relates to comcast spectacor which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia pennsylvania and revenue at peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020

percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm 

for 2020 revenue and operating costs and expenses eliminations increased as a result of licensing of content between our nbcuniversal segments and peacock refer to note 2 for further description of transactions between our segments 





consolidated adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities including the results of entities that we do not consolidate as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs additionally we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax expense investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance 

we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap 



constant currency 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are nongaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations certain of our businesses including sky have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies as a result the comparability of the financial results reported in us dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our sky segment we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year 







our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations funding our capital expenditures investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders refer to “impacts of covid19” for additional discussion 

we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements our commercial paper programs provide a lowercost source of borrowing to fund our shortterm working capital requirements see note 6 for additional information on our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2020 amounts available under our revolving credit facilities net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 92 billion 

comcast nbcuniversal and comcast cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the comcast revolving credit facility the financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage which is the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility we test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis as of december 31 2020 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin we do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant in addition the universal studios japan term loans contain certain financial covenants as of december 31 2020 universal studios japan was in compliance with all of these covenants 

operating activities 



the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impacts of covid19 including the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs which resulted from the 



suspension of studio production operations partially offset by the timing of sporting events as well as the extension of due dates for certain tax payments and accruals related to severance 

the decrease in interest payments in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding 

the decrease in income tax payments in 2020 was primarily due to lower taxable income from operations in 2020 partially offset by the taxable gain associated with the airtouch redemption which approximated the proceeds received 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures cash paid for intangible assets the construction of universal beijing resort purchases of investments and the purchase of spectrum rights which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments net cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures cash paid for intangible assets purchases of investments and the construction of universal beijing resort which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in spending by our theme parks segment as a result of covid19 and by our cable communications segment partially offset by increases in spending by our sky segment reflecting the continued deployment of sky q and highspeed internet services 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future cable communications’ capital expenditures decreased primarily due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2020 2019 and 2018 



we expect our capital expenditures for 2021 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our cable communications segment increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential and the continued deployment of wireless gateways our x1 platform cloud dvr technology sky q and international dtc streaming platforms in addition while we expect to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks in the future we have paused the construction of our additional theme park in orlando florida capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services the capacity required for existing services and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks 

cash paid for intangible assets 

in 2020 cash paid for intangible assets was flat primarily due to decreases in expenditures for software development at our cable communications segment offset by increases in expenditures for software development at both our sky segment and at corporate primarily related to our development of sky q and peacock respectively 

construction of universal beijing resort

guarantee structure 

our debt is primarily issued at comcast although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt

b collateralized obligation relates to a 52 billion term loan facility the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the putcall provisions related to our investment in hulu see note 9 

c purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions our purchase obligations related to cable communications and sky include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers contracts with communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business cable communications’ and sky’s programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming our purchase obligations related to nbcuniversal and sky include commitments to acquire film and television programming and broadcast rights relating to sporting events such as the olympics the nfl and european soccer leagues as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements including obligations to actors producers and television personalities and various other television commitments purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments 

d other longterm liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of deferred compensation obligations and postretirement pension and postemployment benefit obligations our total recorded liability of 28 billion related to participations and residuals are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 14 billion and the associated interest and penalties are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these amounts will become payable a contractual obligation with a carrying value of 11 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled the contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks see note 16 for additional information related to this arrangement 

e our contractual obligations do not include our capital commitment related to our investment in atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding as of december 31 2020 our remaining commitment is 13 billion based on the capital calls received as of that date see note 9 

f total contractual obligations are made up of the following components 





as of december 31 2020 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



see note 8 for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to film and television costs and credit losses 





the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below see also notes 4 and 11 

valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights 

we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including cable franchise rights annually as of july 1 or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a morelikelythannot determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed 

goodwill 

goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates when analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

we performed qualitative assessments in 2020 for goodwill in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments the qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018 changes in projected future cash flows recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions including the effects of covid19 discount rates and changes in our market capitalization based on these assessments we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required we performed a quantitative assessment in 2020 for goodwill in our sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired longlived assets over time given the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our recent acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

cable franchise rights 

our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 



we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights 

for purposes of impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2020 we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018 the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions including the effects of covid19 discount rates and changes in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television content 

we capitalize costs for owned film and television content including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest as well as acquired libraries we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast we recognize the costs of multiyear liveevent sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract our estimates of ultimate revenue for sports rights include estimates of advertising and subscribers receiving or viewing the broadcasts over the term of the agreements 



capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel network or platform basis with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations which are tested on a daypart basis sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment when performing an impairment assessment we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimates of future cash flows which are supported by internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which primarily include cross currency swaps represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program these crosscurrency swaps effectively change our current fixed interest rates to different fixed interest rates 

the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of 9 million in 2020 a decrease of 49 million in 2019 and an increase of 2 million in 2018 interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt effective rates and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2020 



the average interest rates on our debt in the table above reflect the effects of our derivative financial instruments we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2020 plus the applicable borrowing margin 

additionally we have a 52 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in march 2024 we entered into a series of variabletofixed rate interest rate swaps on 52 billion of this term loan with average pay rate and average receive rate related to these interest rate swaps of 112 and 015 as of december 31 2020 respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the estimated fair value of the term loan was 52 billion for each period and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net liability of 155 million and a net asset of 34 million respectively 

see notes 1 6 and 9 for additional information 



we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states through sky and nbcuniversal and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 



as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of nonfunctional currency denominated assets liabilities commitments and forecasted nonfunctional currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of 81 billion and 63 billion respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we use crosscurrency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on 17 billion and 37 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate estimated fair values of crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net liability of 45 million and a net asset of 373 million respectively 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations we have foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using foreign currency denominated debt was 103 billion and 92 billion respectively and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using crosscurrency swaps was 40 billion and 48 billion respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate estimated fair value of these crosscurrency swaps was a net liability of 376 million and 373 million respectively the amount of pretax gains losses related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income loss were losses of 686 million in 2020 gains of 343 million in 2019 and losses of 3 million in 2018 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of december 31 2020 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10 shift in currency exchange rates inclusive of the effects of derivatives the results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2020 net income attributable to comcast corporation 



we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

 phone companies such as att centurylink frontier and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure farther into their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional dsl technology and are offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 



certain other companies have launched ftth networks that provide highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g and recently 5g which is currently available in limited locations wireless broadband services and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile and fixed wireless routers as well as wireless data cards a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports also offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

video 

cable communications competes with a number of different sources in the united states that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 many of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions 

voice 

cable communications competes with wireline and wireless phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” and competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internetbased phone services such as skype 

wireless 

cable communications competes with national wireless phone service providers in the united states including att and verizon which offer wireless service on both a standalone basis or along with other services as bundled offerings as well as regional providers of wireless communications services 



business services 

cable communications primarily competes with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs and wide area network managed service providers these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and voip companies that target businesses of all sizes our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloudbaseddigital solutions 



cable networks and broadcast television 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks ott service providers local broadcast television stations home entertainment products payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content gaming products and other forms of entertainment news and information 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks ott service providers and local television stations the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and ott service providers our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition nbcuniversal’s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

filmed entertainment competes for audiences for films and other entertainment content with other major studios and independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment the competitive position of filmed entertainment primarily depends on the number of films produced their distribution and marketing success and consumer response filmed entertainment also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films we also compete with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of films in theaters and the distribution of films on premium networks and with ott service providers 

theme parks 

theme parks competes with other multipark entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities to help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts in existing and new theme park attractions hotels and infrastructure including the new theme parks in beijing china and orlando florida 



sky competes with a broad range of companies engaged in media entertainment and communications services in europe including cable operators providers of both paidfor and freetoair programming service providers making use of new fiber optic networks other satellite television providers digital terrestrial television providers telecommunications providers other internet service providers content aggregators home entertainment products companies companies developing new technologies and devices and other suppliers and providers of news information sports and entertainment that deliver streaming downloading and other online video services sky’s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of or developments in the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices product innovations new technologies or different value creation approaches sky also competes with organizations that are publicly funded in whole or in part to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate 

sky’s owned channels compete for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 





cable communications cable networks broadcast television and sky compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at the related networks stations or channels declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available including content from ott service providers online media and other digital sources in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations cable communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets this generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year 

revenue and operating costs and expenses comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect cable networks and broadcast television and the super bowl which affects broadcast television in particular advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the olympic games operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in cable communications cable networks broadcast television and sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the us is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in evennumbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising respectively revenue in cable networks and broadcast television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year revenue at sky has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights such as the olympic games and the fifa world cup tm  

revenue in filmed entertainment fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of films released in movie theaters on dvds and through various other distribution platforms release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season content licensing revenue in cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

revenue in theme parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates theme parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the christmas holiday season 

sky results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our dth and ott video services including the start of the new soccer seasons and the christmas holiday this generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses 

exclusive sports rights such as local european and ucl soccer formula 1 and english cricket play a key role within sky’s wider content strategy in europe broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to fiveyear period this creates some level of cyclicality for sky although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market certain of sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year 



legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and federal communications commission “fcc” regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses that operate in the united states these businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state and local authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities in addition our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses these legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services in addition regulators and the courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws as new competition law theories emerge any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant the us congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize the significant legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations and other legislation and regulations for further information 



highspeed internet 

we provide highspeed internet services to our customers many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations or commitments described below as an internet service provider “isp” we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligations on isps in addition states and localities may consider new broadbandrelated regulations including those regarding governmentowned broadband networks new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses 

open internet regulations 

in 2017 the fcc reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a title ii telecommunications service under the communications act and classified it as an “information service” under title i in addition it eliminated its prior rules prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services “throttling” prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration “paid prioritization” and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers’ ability to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers “general conduct” the fcc stated that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the federal trade commission “ftc” in addition the fcc revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that isps disclose any blocking and throttling practices and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in affiliated or paid prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate against lawful content the ftc has authority to enforce these public commitments and the fcc has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule 

the fcc’s 2017 decision was challenged and in 2019 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia largely upheld the fcc’s decision including the classification of broadband as a title i information service and repeal of its prior rules however it vacated the fcc’s express preemption of all state open internet laws but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a casebycase basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy parties have sought further review of the court’s opinion 

several states have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive orders that impose open internet requirements in a variety of ways and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court and additional challenges may be filed such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations 



and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation 

broadband deploymentinfrastructure initiatives 

in 2018 the fcc adopted rules aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks these orders are being challenged in federal court and we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation if the orders are upheld some of these reforms may create regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own the fcc is currently considering additional measures that could result in further preemption of state and local laws or regulations as part of its broader efforts to accelerate wireless broadband infrastructure deployment we cannot predict whether or how any fcc rules might be changed how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted or how such changes may affect our business 

video 

program carriage 

fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage in addition cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in the united states are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and increasingly in the courts and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments  broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

while the vast majority of our video services including equipment and installation fees are no longer subject to rate regulation by the fcc certain state entities monitor and challenge the marketing and advertising of our services and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer we cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity facilities and financial support for public educational and governmental access programming and other inkind contributions the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal including unreasonable renewal conditions we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise the fcc adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise andor fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other noncable services over franchised cable systems and ruling that inkind contributions are treated as franchise fees subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees of 5 of cable service revenue unless those contributions are expressly excluded by statute the order has been appealed and we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 

voice 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund 



contribution obligations rural call completion customer equipment backup power service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services one federal court of appeals has held that voip is an information service and preempted state regulation of voip but that ruling is limited to the seven states located in that circuit state regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level 

wireless 

in 2017 we began offering a wireless voice and data service we offer this service using our mvno rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilitiesbased wireless carriers eg e911 services local number portability etc as well as certain state or local regulations the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos andor mobile broadband providers in the future which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally 



cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with online video distributors maine has enacted a law mandating retail a la carte distribution by cable operators that if upheld by the courts may have similar effects we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and when requested individually we have been involved in program access disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under 

broadcast television 

licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle the next television license renewal cycle begins in 2020 although our licenses have been renewed there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

ownership restrictions 

the communications act and fcc regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station in addition each of the four major broadcast television networks  abc cbs fox and nbc  is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

must carryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either must carry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent the next threeyear period will commence on january 1 2021 with elections to be made by october 1 2020 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures in countries outside the united states a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations 



may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations in the united states and internationally including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards as well as liquor licenses 



sky is subject to regulation primarily under austrian german irish italian uk and european union “eu” law including telecommunications and mediaspecific regulation described below as well as regulation under generally applicable laws such as competition consumer protection data protection and taxation sky is currently and may be in the future subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to sky’s operations including for example to maintain annual funding for sky news in an amount no lower than sky news’ 2017 fiscal year expenditures as adjusted by inflation until 2029 

platform services 

in the uk sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide “epg” and conditional access “ca” services to other programming providers are on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms among other things so that those providers’ content is available on sky’s satellite platform via the epg on sky’s settop boxes sky also has voluntarily committed to the uk’s communications regulator the office of communications or ofcom to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services sky is subject to similar epg and ca obligations in germany 

television channels 

sky holds a number of licenses and authorizations for its portfolio of pay tv channels in the uk sky is subject to various codes issued by ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels sky also holds various nationwide broadcast licenses in germany italy and austria and must comply with rules and regulations covering issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights media concentration and plurality television advertising the protection of children accessibility airtime for commercials and teleshopping sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising 

highspeed internet and voice 

sky provides broadband and voice services in the uk and ireland pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that thirdparty broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions material changes to these regulations could affect sky’s business sky is also subject to eu open internet regulations which prohibit the blocking throttling or discrimination of online content applications and services and require isps to disclose their traffic management throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts 



intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular unauthorized copying distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet through devices software and websites and through counterfeit dvds and other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for nbcuniversal’s and sky’s content businesses we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content although many legal protections exist to combat such practices the extent of copyright protection is ambiguous and the use of technological protections are controversial modifications to existing laws a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws in the united states or internationally to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

us copyright laws also require that our video distribution business contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a cable compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute the compulsory 



copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems in addition the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations we cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay 

privacy and data security regulation 

our businesses are subject to federal state and other foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers’ personal information in the us the communications act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

the ftc generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices we are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under 

in addition certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” gives california residents new rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection use and sharing of “personal information” as well as rights to access delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them the ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 and compliance with that law will increase the cost of providing our services in california more generally the ftc and state attorneys general regularly initiate efforts to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required additionally all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach 

certain of our businesses are subject to the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the eu gdpr and the member states’ legislation implementing the gdpr affect our ability to process certain personal data 

privacy and data security legislation remained a priority issue in 2019 attempts by state and local governments to regulate consumer privacy have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations additionally there are pending federal legislative proposals that if enacted could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information including us we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and if so the impact of any such laws on our business 

fcc 5g spectrum proceedings and other wireless laws and regulations 

in multiple regulatory proceedings the fcc has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for new 5g services cable communications and nbcuniversal use some of this spectrum to provide our services and there is a risk that certain proposed rule changes could affect our ability to use such spectrum and could disrupt certain operations we cannot predict what rules or legislation if any will ultimately be adopted or how any such changes would affect our businesses 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act “itfa” which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges was made permanent by 2016 legislation however some jurisdictions may challenge the itfa or the application of the itfa to our business or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by the itfa 



uk exit from the european union 

the telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to sky and nbcuniversal’s businesses in the uk and the eu may be subject to greater uncertainty upon the uk’s withdrawal from the eu we cannot predict the extent of any potential changes to the regulatory framework involving uk and eu regulation of telecommunications and media or changes to certain mutual recognition arrangements for media and broadcasting 

other regulations 

us states and localities and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring cable equipment pole attachments universal service fees public safety telemarketing leased access indecency loudness of commercial advertisements advertising political broadcasting emergency alert system equal employment opportunity and other employmentrelated laws environmentalrelated matters regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations in addition our international businesses are subject to various international regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the fcc and other federal state and local agencies as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 190000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 88000 66000 and 34000 were associated with cable communications nbcuniversal and sky respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 






 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers ott service providers continue to proliferate complicating the competitive landscape by influencing consumer behavior and challenging existing business models which is discussed in more detail in the risk factor immediately below 

for example 

 for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

consolidation of or cooperation between our competitors including suppliers and distributors of content may increase competition in all of these areas for example consolidation or cooperation between phone companies which are also wireless distributors and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited datausage plans for internet or wireless phone services 

the ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers employees investors and government authorities our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

while we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses such as by growing highspeed internet services and business services and by investing in new theme parks and peacock there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these distribution platforms have driven and will continue to drive changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services and how much they pay for such content 



consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which is reducing the number of cable communications’ video customers and subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks even as it makes cable communications’ highspeed internet services more important to consumers these changing consumer behaviors also are occurring in europe as more of sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to sky’s ott video service instead of its traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our highspeed internet services for changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying the x1 and sky q platforms and flex which can more easily aggregate linear and ott programming choices for our customers the continuing trend of ott service providers delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional video distribution business models 

the increase in ott service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers timeshifting technologies such as dvr and on demand services also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content in addition as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky’s programming channels 

our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

cable communications nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital media radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers such as from social media and video games audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through ott service providers regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic conditions generally in addition advertisers have increasingly shifted their expenditures to digital media and their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which many of nbcuniversal’s networks and some of sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as through ott services or delayed viewing through dvr or on demand services might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of flex and sky q settop boxes and wireless gateways there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures 



we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

in the united states federal state and local governments extensively regulate the highspeed internet video and voice services industries our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by us laws and regulations nbcuniversal’s other businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels sky’s business is subject to various telecommunications and mediaspecific regulations where it operates the fcc ftc and certain state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services and this trend likely will continue in addition regulators and the courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws as new competition law theories emerge failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government including foreign authorities frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statues rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may address communications and other issues that could significantly affect our businesses these legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings regarding our services at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome for example some states have passed or introduced legislation or executive orders that impose various open internet and data privacy requirements such attempts by the states to regulate portions of our businesses have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations these requirements and any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect cable communications’ and sky’s video businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communications and sky segments and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally cable communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications and sky segments’ results of operations 

moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms if renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of cable communications’ or sky’s video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s and sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content at nbcuniversal and sky in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance we also are incurring significant costs to develop peacock and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering 

nbcuniversal and sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content we also may be unable to license popular thirdparty content for nbcuniversal’s and sky’s 



programming channels if media companies launch successful ott services for their owned content such that they forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers 

entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights for nbcuniversal and sky our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of rights payments and the ability of nbcuniversal to secure distribution from impose surcharges on or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers the number of subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks has been and likely will continue to be reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers 

increasingly nbcuniversal and sky are entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including ott services if this programming does not attract sufficient viewers traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may not distribute nbcuniversal’s or sky’s programming and ott services may not license programming nbcuniversal or sky creates in addition we expect not to license certain popular content and we may decide not to license additional popular content that we own to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through peacock which would result in foregone licensing revenue 

nbcuniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us 

there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms the inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses 

less favorable telecommunications access regulations the loss of sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect sky’s businesses 

sky relies on various thirdparty telecommunications providers to deliver its video highspeed internet voice and wireless phone services to its customers for example sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services in addition pursuant to the current regulatory regimes in the uk and italy sky is able to access networks owned by thirdparty telecommunications providers to offer its highspeed internet and phone services in most cases on regulated terms including price if there is a change in regulation in the uk italy or other markets where sky accesses networks owned by thirdparty telecommunications providers the regulated terms could become less favorable moreover while sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms pricing terms are not regulated as a result if sky is unable to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on commercially reasonable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates which would adversely affect sky’s businesses and results of operations 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery and technology embedded in our products and services are critical to our business activities 



cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks information systems and other technologies network information systems and technologyrelated events including those caused by us such as process breakdowns security architecture or design vulnerabilities or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or power outages natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services excessive call volume to call centers theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets a reduction in demand for our theme parks disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment data properties and reputation in addition severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future the occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties products services networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and in some cases provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our thirdparty’s information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities while we develop and maintain systems and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches we have experienced systemsrelated events and breaches in the past and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates 



the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses it also presents similar challenges for sky’s businesses including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment products or services we need in a timely manner or at all or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions in the united states or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communications’ or sky’s services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as ott video services or substitute services for highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks 

weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt if our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected further a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms if at all and could increase the cost of our borrowings 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives including our 2018 acquisition of sky and the development of peacock and new theme parks in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives additionally federal regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions tariffs and trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks including the british pound and euro the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange 



rate fluctuations sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu referred to as “brexit” including financial legal tax and trade implications in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest as well as corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations our businesses may be adversely affected 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights including patents employment and labor matters personal injury and property damage customer privacy regulatory requirements advertising marketing and selling practices and credit and collection issues greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses 

in addition nbcuniversal and sky depend on the abilities and expertise of onair and creative talent if we fail to attract or retain onair or creative talent if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected

 2019 developments 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2019  

cable communications segment

other 

 competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models in particular consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes highspeed internet services more important to consumers in addition the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers this increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels 

for additional information on the competition our businesses face see item 1 business and item 1a risk factors within the business section refer to the “competition” discussion and within the risk factors section refer to the risk factors entitled “our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models”

realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net 

the change in realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to gains of 293 million related to our interest in snap which was sold in 2019 compared to losses of 268 million in 2018 and unrealized gains of 184 million related to our investment in peloton interactive inc “peloton” 

other income loss net

in 2019 the effective income tax rate included 125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019 

in 2018 the effective income tax rate included the effects of an income tax benefit of 244 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of sky and 128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018 partially offset by 148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018 



the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the redemption value of one of our noncontrolling interests 



our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use adjusted ebitda as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments adjusted ebitda is defined as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax expense  investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance adjusted ebitda for our segments is not a nongaap financial measure we reconcile the aggregate amount of adjusted ebitda for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements 

beginning in the first quarter of 2019 comcast cable’s wireless phone service and certain other cablerelated business development initiatives are presented in the cable communications segment results were previously presented in corporate and other prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers as well as changes in advertising revenue while revenue from our residential highspeed internet video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship 

each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings we believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our highermargin businesses including residential highspeed internet and business services

consolidated adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities including the results of entities that we do not consolidate as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs additionally we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax expense  investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related 



to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance 

we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap 



constant currency 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are nongaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations certain of our businesses including sky have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies as a result the comparability of the financial results reported in us dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our sky segment we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance 

constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year 







our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations funding our capital expenditures investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders 

we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements our commercial paper programs provide a lowercost source of borrowing to fund our shortterm working capital requirements see note 7 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revolving credit facilities as of december 31 2019  amounts available under our revolving credit facilities net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 92 billion  

comcast nbcuniversal and comcast cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the comcast revolving credit facility the financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage which is the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility we test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis as of december 31 2019  we met this financial covenant by a significant margin we do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant in addition the universal studios japan term loans contain certain financial covenants as of december 31 2019  universal studios japan was in compliance with all of these covenants 

operating activities 



the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to the timing of film and television costs and our broadcast of the 2018 super bowl at nbcuniversal partially offset by the timing of collections on receivables and our broadcast of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics 

the increase in interest payments in 2019 was primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding including the issuance of new debt in 2018 associated with the financing of the sky transaction 

the increase in income tax payments in 2019 was primarily due to reduced tax payments in 2018 as a result of federal income tax overpayments in 2017 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures purchases of investments cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of universal beijing resort net cash used in investing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions cash paid for capital expenditures cash paid for intangible assets and purchase of investments 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures increased in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a full year of capital expenditures for 2019 sky capital expenditures totaled 768 million in 2019  reflecting the continued deployment of sky q and highspeed internet services 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 197 to 21 billion in 2019 primarily due to an increase in spending at our universal theme parks including construction of an additional theme park in orlando florida 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future cable communications’ capital expenditures decreased 105 in 2019 compared to 



2018 primarily due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2019  2018 and 2017  



we expect our capital expenditures for 2020 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our cable communications segment increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential and the continued deployment of wireless gateways our x1 platform cloud dvr technology sky q and international ott platforms in addition we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks including the additional theme park being constructed in orlando florida capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services the capacity required for existing services and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks 

cash paid for intangible assets 

in 2019  cash paid for intangible assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a full year of expense included in our results of operations for 2019  and to a lesser extent expenditures for software in our cable communications segment our sky segment’s cash paid for intangible assets totaled 707 million in 2019 and consisted primarily of expenditures for software development related to sky q and highspeed internet services in 2018  cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of expenditures for software in our cable communication segment and to a lesser extent expenditures for software in our nbcuniversal segments 

acquisitions and construction of real estate properties 

acquisitions and construction of real estate properties primarily included the construction of the comcast technology center in philadelphia pennsylvania which was completed in 2019  

construction of universal beijing resort 

construction of universal beijing resort includes costs related to the construction of the universal theme park and resort in beijing china see note 8 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 7 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for further information on universal beijing resort 

purchases of investments 

purchases of investments in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to capital contributions to hulu and atairos 

other 

other investing activities in 2019 were primarily related to distributions received from equity method investments other investing activities in 2018 were primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of an investment and proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and a collateralized obligation net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings including the financing of the sky acquisition partially offset by repayments of debt repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans and dividend payments 

in 2019  we made debt repayments of 144 billion  including 61 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2021 to 2023 52 billion of senior notes due 2020 and 30 billion of senior notes due 2019 

in august 2019 we received proceeds of approximately 52 billion under a term loan facility due 2024 which is presented as a collateralized obligation the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the putcall provisions related to our investment in hulu in november 2019 we issued 16 billion of senior notes due 2030 135 billion of senior notes due 2039 and 18 billion of senior notes due 2050 the proceeds from the collateralized obligation and the senior notes were used to repay debt in 2019  we made borrowings of 728 million under the universal beijing resort term loan

refer to note 7 and note 17 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

 



as of december 31 2019  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



see note 9 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 8 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to leases 





  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights the accounting for film and television costs and the valuation of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 4 8 and 12 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights 

we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a morelikelythannot determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed 

goodwill 

goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates when analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

we performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units in 2019 this assessment considered changes in our projected future cash flows and discount rates recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired longlived assets over time goodwill in our cable communications segment and our nbcuniversal segments has resulted from the combination of legacy businesses and newly acquired businesses and as a result the fair values of the reporting units are significantly in excess of the respective carrying values the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 given this was a recent transaction the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

cable franchise rights 

our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights 



for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2019  we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018 the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the northeast central and west divisions by 29 46 and 58 respectively we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment market transactions and macroeconomic conditions discount rates and changes in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

changes in market conditions laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments including expected cash flows competitive factors and discount rates could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast we recognize the costs of multiyear liveevent sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract advance payments for rights to multiyear liveevent sports programming are included in programming rights 

capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented 



fair value of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values in determining fair value management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain as part of the estimation process thirdparty valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities 

our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for instance the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

intangible assets 

intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finitelived customer relationships and indefinitelived trade names 

customer relationships were valued using a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates this measure of fair value also requires considerable judgments about future events including attrition contract renewal estimates and technology changes 

in determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finitelived intangibles we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset 

trade names were valued using the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

property and equipment 

property and equipment includes customer premise equipment as well as network assets real estate and other machinery and equipment 

property and equipment was valued using the reproduction and replacement cost approaches as well as a cost approach for real estate the reproduction and replacement cost approaches measure the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets and adjust for the age and condition of the asset the cost approach measures the value of real estate through an evaluation of recent comparable transactions or current listings of available properties 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market assumptions when available 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



  

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which primarily include cross currency swaps represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program these cross currency swaps effectively change our current fixed interest rates to different fixed interest rates 

the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of 49 million in 2019  an increase of 2 million in 2018  and a decrease of 5 million in 2017  the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2019 by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt effective rates and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us 





the average interest rates on our debt in the table above reflect the effects of our derivative financial instruments we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2019  plus the applicable borrowing margin 

additionally we have a 52 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in march 2024 we entered into a series of variabletofixed rate interest rate swaps on 36 billion of this term loan with average pay rate and average receive rate related to these interest rate swaps of 123 and 180 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively as of december 31 2019  the estimated fair value of the term loan was 52 billion and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net asset of 34 million 

see notes 1 7 and 10 to comcast’s and notes 1 and 9 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments and hedging activities 



we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states through sky and nbcuniversal and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of nonfunctional currency denominated assets liabilities commitments and forecasted nonfunctional currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of 63 billion and 58 billion  respectively including contracts at nbcuniversal of 14 billion and 12 billion  respectively as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we use crosscurrency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments as of both december 31 2019 and 2018  we had crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on 37 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt  as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate estimated fair values of crosscurrency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net asset of 373 million and 399 million  respectively 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations we have foreign currency denominated debt and use crosscurrency swaps to hedge our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the aggregate amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries that have been hedged using crosscurrency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt was 140 billion and 156 billion  as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate estimated fair value of the crosscurrency swaps was a net liability of 373 million and 587 million  respectively as of december 31 2019 and 2018  there were pretax cumulative translation gains of 339 million and pretax cumulative translation losses of 4 million  respectively related to these net investment hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of december 31 2019  including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and 



liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10 shift in currency exchange rates inclusive of the effects of derivatives the results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2019 net income attributable to comcast corporation 



we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

 phone companies such as att centurylink frontier and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure farther into their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional dsl technology and are offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 

certain other companies have launched ftth networks that provide highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g and recently 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers as well as wireless data cards a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants 



and airports also offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

video services 

cable communications competes with a number of different sources in the united states that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 many of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions 

voice services 

cable communications’ voice services compete with wireline and wireless phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” and competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internetbased phone services such as skype 

business services 

cable communications’ business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs and wan managed service providers these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier’s network it also competes with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and voip companies that target businesses of all sizes our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloudbaseddigital solutions 





cable networks and broadcast television 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks subscription video on demand services local broadcast television stations home entertainment products payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content gaming products and other forms of entertainment news and information 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and subscription video on demand services the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services its broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition nbcuniversal’s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

the filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment the competitive position of the filmed entertainment business primarily depends on the number of films produced their distribution and marketing success and consumer response the filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films the filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and the distribution of its films on premium networks and on subscription video on demand services 

theme parks 

nbcuniversal’s theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies it also competes with other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities to help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions hotels and infrastructure 



sky faces competition from a broad range of companies engaged in media entertainment and communications services in europe including cable operators providers of both paidfor and freetoair programming service providers making use of new fiber optic networks other satellite television providers digital terrestrial television providers telecommunications providers other internet service providers content aggregators home entertainment products companies companies developing new technologies and devices and other suppliers and providers of news information sports and entertainment that deliver streaming and downloading online video services sky’s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of or developments in the means of delivery which its competitors use to provide their services sky’s competitors also include organizations that are publicly funded in whole or in part which fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate 

sky competes for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 



the cable communications business cable networks broadcast networks owned local broadcast television stations and sky compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations and sky’s owned channels declines in audience ratings also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by 



audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available including content from subscription video on demand services and other digital sources in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the us is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue in the us is also cyclical with a benefit in evennumbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year 

our revenue and operating costs and expenses comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments and the super bowl which affects our broadcast television segment in particular our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of films released in movie theaters on dvds and through various other distribution platforms release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season content licensing revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season 

our sky segment results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our dth and ott video services including the start of the new soccer seasons and the christmas holiday this generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to higher marketing expenses growth in sky’s wireless phone business is also similarly impacted by seasonal trends as well as by the length of consumer cycles to upgrade their handsets 

exclusive tier one sports rights such as domestic and uefa champions league soccer formula 1 and english cricket play a key role within sky’s wider content strategy in europe broadcasting rights for tier one sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to fiveyear period this creates some level of cyclicality for sky although the staggered timing of tier one sports rights auctions usually gives sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market 

the results of sky’s advertising business are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels this includes seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights such as the olympic games and the fifa world cup tm  the results for sky’s content business are also subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in timing nature and quantity of original programming distributed to other markets 



legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses that operate in the united states these businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state and local authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities in addition our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses these legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation and they along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant the us congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations and other legislation and regulations for further information 



highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services to our customers many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below as an internet service provider “isp” we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligations on isps new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses 

open internet regulations 

in 2015 the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act these included among other things prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services “throttling” prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration “paid prioritization” and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or edge providers’ ability to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers “general conduct” 

in 2017 the fcc reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a title ii telecommunication service and classified it as an “information service” under title i in addition it eliminated its prior noblocking nothrottling no paidprioritization and general conduct rules stating that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the ftc in addition it revised the transparency rule to require isps to disclose any blocking and throttling practices and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in affiliated or paid prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate against lawful content the ftc has authority to enforce these public commitments and the fcc has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule the order also preempted any state and local laws and regulations that conflict with the fcc’s deregulatory policies 

the fcc’s 2017 decision is currently on appeal in federal court in addition several states have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive orders that impose open internet requirements in a variety of ways certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court and additional challenges may be filed such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation 



broadband deploymentinfrastructure initiatives 

in 2018 the fcc adopted rules aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks these orders are being challenged in federal court and we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation if the orders are upheld some of these reforms may create regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own the fcc is considering similar reforms for wireline networks including our networks as part of its ongoing efforts to promote broadband deployment we cannot predict whether or how any fcc rules might be changed how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted or how such changes may affect our business in addition as part of any federal infrastructure program governmental subsidies or funding of additional internet broadband networks may be encouraged we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of governmentowned networks although some may choose to ease or facilitate such networks we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business 

video services 

program carriage 

fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage in addition cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in the united states are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future   

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations in 2017 the fcc adopted an order relaxing the broadcast media ownership rules and is considering additional revisions to the rules which could lead to further broadcast television station consolidation the fcc also adopted an order authorizing voluntary implementation of a new broadcast technical standard that permits broadcasters to seek carriage of signals using the new standard through retransmission consent together these actions may impact retransmission consent negotiations and the fees we pay broadcasters for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments  broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section   

pricing and packaging 

we are subject to rate regulation of charges for certain of our video service equipment and installation in certain communities in massachusetts but all of the other areas we serve have unregulated prices in addition to the fcc’s rate regulation rules certain state entities monitor and may challenge the marketing and advertising of our services for example in 2016 the washington state attorney general filed a lawsuit currently being litigated in state court alleging that our service protection plan an optional plan that protects customers from incurring charges for service visits to diagnose and repair installed inhome wiring for residential cable services violates state consumer protection laws we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or whether other states may file similar suits 

pole attachments 

the fcc regulates the rates terms and conditions that most poleowning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers for allowing attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rates terms and conditions of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so and have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments the rates terms and conditions of some municipal and cooperative pole owners however are not regulated by the fcc or states 



franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal including unreasonable renewal conditions we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise in response to a remand by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit the fcc has proposed to clarify that inkind contribution requirements in a cable franchise are generally subject to the statutory five percent cap on franchise fees and reaffirm that state and local authorities are barred from imposing duplicative franchise andor fee requirements on the operation of cable systems to provide noncable services we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its impact on our businesses 

voice services 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations rural call completion backup power service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services recently the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that voip is an information service and preempted state regulation of voip but that ruling is limited to the seven states located in the eighth circuit state regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level 

voice interconnection 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services providers of voip services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec which has the right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies we have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated clecs if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic and has affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers 

wireless service 

in 2017 we began offering a wireless voice and data service we offer this service using our mobile virtual network operator “mvno” rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilitiesbased wireless carriers eg e911 services local number portability etc as well as certain state or local regulations the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos andor mobile broadband providers in the future or impose new taxes or fees which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally 

universal service 

the federal universal service program generally requires us and other phone service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from interstate and international services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of voice services and broadbandcapable voice networks in highcost areas the provision of voice services to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet voice and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers some states also have analogous programs that support service in highcost areas or to lowincome consumers 

the fcc has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing deployment of broadbandcapable networks and broadband facilities this shift could assist some of our competitors for example the fcc has revised the highcost federal universal service mechanism to support broadbandcapable networks and substantially has revised the program that provides universal service support for services to schools and libraries to begin phasing out support for voice services with greater support directed to broadband services and the deployment of wifi networks similarly the fcc has expanded its lifeline subsidy program for lowincome consumers to include broadband services in addition to voice services the fcc or congress 



may revisit these subsidy programs and how they are funded we cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed in the future 



cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with online video distributors we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and when requested individually we have been involved in program access disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age in 2018 the fcc initiated a proceeding to review its regulations regarding children’s programming and we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 

broadcast television 

licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions the fcc recently renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions although our licenses have been renewed there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

local television ownership 

the fcc recently revised its rules to generally permit a licensee to own up to two broadcast stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the dma based on audience share in addition the new rules permit a licensee to own up to two stations ranked in the top four in a dma based on a casebycase analysis of the circumstances surrounding the proposed combination these recent changes are subject to judicial appeal these   ownership restrictions do not apply if the signal coverage of the stations involved do not overlap in the same market as part of its 2018 quadrennial review of media ownership regulations the fcc raised questions about the twostationperdma ownership limit and the criteria by which topfour combinations should be assessed 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households the fcc also has a rule that affords a 50 discount to uhf stations channels 14 and above in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap the fcc has initiated a proceeding to consider whether to retain the 50 discount and whether to modify the national television ownership limit our owned broadcast television station reach does not exceed the current limit even without considering the discount for uhf stations but elimination of the 50 discount without an increase in the 39 national cap would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast television station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest 

dual network rule 

each of the four major broadcast television networks  abc cbs fox and nbc  is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four as part of its 2018 quadrennial review of media ownership regulations the fcc raised questions about whether the dual network rule remains necessary in the public interest 



must carryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either must carry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent 

indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures in countries outside the united states a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards as well as liquor licenses 



sky is subject to regulation primarily under austrian german irish italian uk and european union “eu” law including telecommunications and mediaspecific regulation described below as well as regulation under generally applicable laws such as competition consumer protection data protection and taxation sky is currently and may be in the future subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to sky’s operations including for example to maintain annual funding for sky news in an amount no lower than sky news’ 2017 fiscal year expenditures as adjusted by inflation until 2029 

platform services 

in the uk under the uk communications act of 2003 sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide electronic program guide “epg” and conditional access “ca” services to other programming providers are on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms among other things so that those providers’ content is available on sky’s satellite platform via the epg on sky’s settop boxes sky also has voluntarily committed to ofcom the uk regulator to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services sky is subject to similar epg and ca obligations in germany under the interstate treaty on broadcasting and telemedia as amended by the 20 th  state broadcasting amendment treaty the “rstv” 

television channels 

sky holds a number of licenses and authorizations for its portfolio of pay tv channels in the uk as a broadcast licensee sky is subject to various codes issued by ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels these codes include for example ofcom’s broadcasting code the code on the scheduling of television advertising and the crosspromotion code sky also holds various nationwide broadcast licenses in germany and must comply with the rstv the applicable laws of the federal state in germany that has granted the broadcasting license and with the interstate treaty on the protection of minors these include regulations regarding media concentration television advertising accessibility airtime for commercials and teleshopping sponsorship and the requirement for a clear distinction between program content and advertising sky is also a holder of broadcasting licenses in austria and is subject to broadcast regulations under the austrian act on audiovisual media services such as regulations governing content advertisements and the protection of children in addition sky is subject to austrian rules on media plurality which prohibit broadcasters in austria from exceeding certain media coverage thresholds in italy sky must comply with various requirements regarding broadcast authorizations including provisions that protect media plurality obligations requiring broadcasters to guarantee equal treatment between political parties during elections advertising limits the protection of children and parental controls the protection of ip rights and consumer protections nbcuniversal’s international television channels are subject to similar regulations in jurisdictions in which they operate 



highspeed internet and voice services 

sky provides broadband and voice services in the uk and ireland pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that thirdparty broadband and telecommunications companies are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions material changes to these regulations could affect sky’s business sky is also subject to eu open internet regulations which prohibit the blocking throttling or discrimination of online content applications and services and require isps to disclose their traffic management throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts 



intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular unauthorized copying distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet through devices software and websites and through counterfeit dvds and other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses and sky’s businesses we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content although many legal protections exist to combat such practices the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections are controversial modifications to existing laws a weakening of these protections or a failure of existing laws in the united states or internationally to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

us copyright laws also require that our video business contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a cable compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute the cable compulsory license royalties we pay are subject to audit by copyright owners and we cannot predict how any disputes regarding our royalty calculations will impact those fees in the future in addition the copyright office has initiated a rulemaking to consider how royalty payments should be calculated under the cable compulsory license we cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking but there is a risk that it could result in higher royalty payments it is also possible that congress will eliminate or modify the cable compulsory license in the future which could impact the retransmission of broadcast signals over cable systems the music fees we pay are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with performing rights organizations the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing new performing rights organizations have formed to seek higher royalties for the use of music they represent and other organizations seek royalties for performance rights for which no compensation is currently required we cannot predict how renegotiation of current rights and future changes in music royalties will affect the music fees that we pay 

privacy and data security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

the ftc generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices 

in addition certain states have exercised oversight of consumer privacy protections in their respective states the ftc and state attorney generals regularly initiate efforts to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

in may 2018 the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the eu regardless of whether the processing actually takes place in the eu came into effect gdpr and the member states’ legislation implementing the gdpr affect our ability to process certain personal data we cannot predict how regulators will interpret the scope or requirements of gdpr 

privacy and data security legislation remained a priority issue in 2018 in many us states and localities as well as foreign jurisdictions outside of the eu for example california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly regulates the sale of the consumer information of california residents and grants california residents certain rights to among other things access and delete data about them in certain circumstances ccpa goes into effect on january 1 2020 and compliance with the ccpa may increase the cost of providing our services in california other states are considering similar proposals such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations 



additionally there are pending federal legislative proposals that if enacted could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information including us we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and if so the impact of any such laws on our business 

we are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age in addition we are subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to any person’s sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach and the fcc has adopted security breach rules for voice services several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information including the proper disposal of consumer information 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts and sms messages 

fcc spectrum auction and repacking 

in 2017 as a result of an incentive auction conducted by the fcc to repurpose television broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use nbcuniversal sold broadcast spectrum rights associated with television stations in three of its markets those stations vacated their sold spectrum but continue to operate by sharing channels with other nbcuniversal stations in those markets the fcc assigned 23 of nbcuniversal’s other television stations that did not sell their spectrum rights to new channels those stations are in the process of transitioning to their new channels in a postauction repacking process that is scheduled to conclude in the third quarter of 2020 and the fcc will reimburse those stations for a portion of their reasonable relocation costs subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of 275 billion as a result of the repacking process comcast will have to make changes to its cable systems to accommodate broadcasters on their newly assigned channels and will be reimbursed by the fcc for a portion of those related costs subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of 275 billion 

in addition we acquired 73 new mobile broadband licenses in this auction for 17 billion we will be obligated to meet certain regulatory requirements concerning the use of these licenses over the coming years 

fcc 5g spectrum proceedings and other wireless laws and regulations 

in multiple regulatory proceedings the fcc is currently considering establishing andor modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services commonly referred to as 5g services some of this spectrum is currently used for satellite delivery of broadcast and cable programming to cable headends and broadcast stations including our own and there is a risk that such satellite delivery could be disrupted if the fcc were to adopt certain proposals in addition there is potential for new legislation or fcc regulations that could enable wireless providers to offer video and other services over their networks subject to different and possibly fewer regulatory obligations than the services we provide we cannot predict what rules or legislation if any will ultimately be adopted or how any such changes would affect our businesses 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges was made permanent by 2016 legislation however some jurisdictions have or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by internet tax freedom act 



environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs 

uk exit from the european union 

the telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to sky and nbcuniversal’s businesses in the uk and the eu may be subject to greater uncertainty in the event that the uk leaves the eu we cannot predict the extent of any potential changes to the regulatory framework involving uk and eu regulation of telecommunications and media or changes to certain mutual recognition arrangements for media and broadcasting 

other regulations 

us states and localities and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring cable equipment leased access loudness of commercial advertisements advertising emergency alert system equal employment opportunity and other employmentrelated laws lottery programming recordkeeping and public file requirements regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations in addition our international businesses are subject to various international regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the fcc and other federal state and local agencies as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 184000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 88000 64000 and 30000 were associated with our cable communications business our nbcuniversal businesses and our sky business respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers online video distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading “changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 



competition for cable communications’ cable services consists primarily of phone companies with fiberbased networks and dbs providers that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours some of these competitors are also offering smaller packages of channels at price points lower than our standard packages both through traditional and online video distribution platforms which could cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable consolidation between phone companies which are also wireless distributors and content providers in the united states provides competitors with the ability to offer free or lower cost streaming services for viewing their content potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited datausage plans for their internet or wireless phone services additional companies some with significant financial resources continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market either by offering ott streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various ott services 

sky faces competition in video highspeed internet and voice services from cable andor telecommunications providers in each of its european markets more providers in europe now offer customers bundles of services which has increased competition the intensity of this competition has increased in recent years including as a result of ott streaming services 

cable communications’ and sky’s highspeed internet services compete primarily against phone companies with fiberbased networks offering speeds and pricing comparable to ours wireless internet services such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services satellitedelivered internet services and wifi networks and devices such as smartphones tablets wireless data cards and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices also may compete with our highspeed internet services particularly as wireless technology evolves some municipalities in the united states own and operate their own broadband networks and additional municipalities may do so as well cable communications’ and sky’s wireline voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and internetbased phone services 

we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of cable communications’ cable services network such as by growing highspeed internet services and business services and by launching additional services such as our security and automation services sky also is seeking ways to enhance the value of its services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications or sky segment revenue maintain cable communications or sky segment operating margins or to compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses and sky also face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent content and other resources required in operating these businesses 

the ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and government authorities our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or newer competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services and how much they pay for such content 

consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of cable communications’ video customers and subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks even as it makes cable communications’ highspeed internet services more important to consumers while these changes are primarily affecting our us businesses today there can be no assurance that they will not also affect sky’s businesses to a similar extent in the future even with sky offering a standalone ott video streaming service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings to changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying the x1 platform and adding apps such as netflix and amazon prime video on settop boxes virtual multichannel video providers online video distributors and programming networks providing their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through traditional video distribution services continue to emerge gain consumer acceptance and disrupt traditional video distribution services many of these service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than traditional video packages for access to their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for cable communications’ and sky’s video services including for expanded video packages premium networks and dvr and on demand services 



an increasing number of companies offering ott streaming services including some with exclusive highquality original video programming as well as programming networks offering content directly to consumers over the internet have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choices adversely affects the audience ratings of nbcuniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and sky’s owned television channels timeshifting technologies such as video on demand services and dvr and cloudbased recording services also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for nbcuniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and sky’s owned television channels and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount nbcuniversal and sky receive for distribution of their content 

the success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks broadcast television and sky businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital media radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers such as from social media and video games and audience fragmentation increased viewing of adfree content through online video distribution platforms regulatory intervention regarding where advertising may be placed or the economy in general in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which many of nbcuniversal’s networks and sky’s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as viewing content through many online video distribution platforms or delayed viewing on dvrs might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the us deployment of docsis 31 and docsis fdx our x1 and sky q settop boxes cloud dvr and wireless gateways there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

in the united states federal state and local governments extensively regulate the highspeed internet video and voice services industries our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by us laws and regulations nbcuniversal’s cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels sky’s business is subject to various telecommunications and mediaspecific regulations in most of the countries where it operates the fcc and certain state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries   and reviews regarding our services and this trend likely will continue failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government including foreign authorities frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statues rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses these legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation regarding our services for example some states have passed or introduced legislation or executive orders that 



impose various open internet and data privacy requirements such attempts by the states to regulate portions of our businesses have the potential to create a patchwork of differing andor conflicting state regulations these requirements and any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant the us congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect cable communications’ and sky’s video businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communications and sky segments and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally cable communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications and sky segments’ results of operations 

moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms if renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of cable communications’ or sky’s video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s and sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s as well as sky’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute nbcuniversal’s cable network and broadcast television programming sky’s owned television channels filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on nbcuniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television networks and sky’s owned television channels in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it will earn consumer acceptance 

nbcuniversal and sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers including in the case of sky sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights for nbcuniversal and sky our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for nbcuniversal’s content and the timing and amount of rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses may be adversely affected 



the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers increasingly nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses are entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including subscription video on demand services if nbcuniversal’s programming does not attract sufficient viewers traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute nbcuniversal’s broadcast and cable networks and ott video streaming services may not license programming we create in addition the number of subscribers to nbcuniversal’s cable networks has been and may continue to be reduced as a result of multichannel video providers offering smaller packages of channels as part of their virtual or traditional television programming packages and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video providers 

nbcuniversal’s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us 

there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce nbcuniversal’s revenues and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

less favorable regulation the loss of sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect sky’s businesses 

sky relies on various telecommunications providers to deliver its video highspeed internet voice and wireless phone services to its customers for example sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services in addition pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the uk and italy sky is able to access networks owned by thirdparty telecommunication providers to provide its highspeed internet and phone services in most cases on regulated terms including price these regulated terms could become less favorable moreover while sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms pricing terms are not regulated if sky is unable to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on commercially reasonable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates 

the loss of sky’s wholesale distribution agreements with traditional multichannel video providers could adversely affect sky’s businesses 

sky benefits from its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with traditional multichannel video providers there can be no assurance that any of its distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce sky’s revenues and the reach of its television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect sky’s businesses 



we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery and technology embedded in our products and services are critical to our business activities cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks information systems and other technologies network information systems and technologyrelated events including those caused by us such as process breakdowns security architecture or design vulnerabilities or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or power outages natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services excessive call volume to call centers theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets a reduction in demand for our theme parks disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment data properties and reputation in addition severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future the occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties products services networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and may in some cases provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our thirdparty’s information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches we have experienced minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our products services or operations while we develop and maintain systems and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s and sky’s businesses and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material 



negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for nbcuniversal’s cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses it also presents similar challenges for sky’s businesses including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment products or services we need in a timely manner or at all or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions in the united states or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communications’ cable services or sky’s services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as ott video services or substitute services for highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks 

weak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt if our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected further a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms if at all and could increase the cost of our borrowings 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives including our 2018 acquisition of sky and 2017 launch of a wireless phone service using virtual network operator rights in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives additionally federal regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights including patents employment and labor matters personal injury and property 



damage customer privacy regulatory requirements advertising marketing and selling practices and credit and collection issues we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses 

in addition our cable networks broadcast television filmed entertainment and sky businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of onair and creative talent if we fail to attract or retain onair or creative talent if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through sky and nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments sky’s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdom’s referendum to withdraw membership from the eu referred to as “brexit” including financial legal tax and trade implications in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest as well as corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur our businesses may be adversely affected

cable communications segment 

 nbcuniversal segments 

 sky segment 

 corporate and other 





competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all  of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information products and services to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models in particular consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our highspeed internet services more valuable to consumers in addition the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming 

for additional information on the competition our businesses face see item 1 business and item 1a risk factors within the business section refer to the “competition” discussion and within the risk factors section refer to the risk factors entitled “our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models”

consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2018  and 2017  primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the current year period and increases in capital expenditures as well as expenditures for software in our cable communications segment in recent years capital expenditures increased in our cable communications segment as we continue to invest in network capacity and in customer premise equipment primarily for our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways certain assets in our cable communications segment have relatively short estimated useful lives which also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in 2018  and 2017  and will continue to increase depreciation expense in 2019  nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to our continued investment in new attractions in our theme parks segment 



including for universal studios japan sky depreciation and amortization expense is related primarily to property and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets 

amortization expense from acquisitionrelated intangible assets such as customer relationships totaled 11 billion 824 million and 790 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011 and 2018 included 267 million related to our preliminary estimates of sky customer relationship intangible assets for the period october 9 2018 to december 31 2018 amounts related to sky are estimates and subject to change as we finalize acquisition accounting see note 8 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information

consolidated investment and other income loss net 

equity in net income losses of investees net 

the changes in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2018  and 2017  were primarily due to our equity method investments in atairos group inc and hulu llc atairos which commenced operations in 2016 follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income we recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income losses of investees net the losses at hulu were driven by its higher programming advertising and marketing costs and higher other administrative expenses the table below summarizes the equity in net income losses of atairos and hulu in 2018  2017  and 2016  



realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net 

the change in realized and unrealized gains losses on equity securities net for 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily due to the adoption of updated accounting guidance for our marketable equity securities which primarily relates to our investment in snap see note 10 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 9 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements 

other income loss net 

other income loss net for 2018  and 2017  primarily included interest and dividend income

income tax expense benefit reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions our effective income tax rate in 2018  was 222  which included the effects of the 2017 tax act and also an income tax benefit of 128 million  recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018 which were partially offset by higher taxable income from operations and 148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018 the 2017 tax act among other things reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 we recognized an income tax benefit of 244 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of sky see note 5 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion on tax reform 

our effective income tax rate in 2017  was a benefit of 493  the enactment of the 2017 tax act resulted in a net income tax benefit of 127 billion in 2017 primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability excluding this tax benefit our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 333 

additionally in 2017 we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of 297 million  in 2017 our income tax benefit also increased 121 million due to the impact of an internal legal reorganization in the third quarter of 2017 which was partially offset by a decrease of 53 million due to changes in state tax laws our effective income tax rate in 2016  was an expense of 370  



the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2018  was primarily due to the noncontrolling interest holders’ share of the loss related to universal beijing resort in 2018 we entered into an agreement with a consortium of chinese stateowned companies to build and operate a universal theme park and resort in beijing china and obtained a 30 interest in universal beijing resort see note 8 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion on noncontrolling interest related to universal beijing resort the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2017  was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interests in universal studios japan that we did not already own in april 2017 



our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use adjusted ebitda as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments adjusted ebitda is defined as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax benefit expense investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance adjusted ebitda for our segments is not a nongaap financial measure we reconcile the aggregate amount of adjusted ebitda for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements 

to be consistent with our current management reporting presentation certain 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified within the cable communications segment and certain 2018 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified related to certain nbcuniversal businesses now presented in the sky segment 















customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding for multiple dwelling units “mdus” including buildings located on college campuses whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services such as additional programming choices or our highdefinition video “hd” or digital video recorder “dvr” advanced services we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services the mdu is counted as a single customer in 2017 we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service residential highspeed internet and video customers as of december 31 2018 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 135000 and 5000 respectively customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services single product double product and triple and quad product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one two or three and four of our cable services respectively 

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017  was 15395 and 15270 respectively this metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers as well as changes in advertising revenue while revenue from our residential highspeed internet video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship 

average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017  was 6267 and 6062 respectively each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings we believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our highermargin businesses including residential highspeed internet and business services 

cable communications segment – revenue 

cable communications is one of the nation’s largest providers of highspeed internet video voice and security and automation services “cable services” to residential customers under the xfinity brand we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services which we market individually and as bundled services our cable communications segment also generates revenue from selling through our allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that is received as part of distribution agreements with these networks to local regional and national advertisers

cable communications offers highspeed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second “gbps” and fiberbased speeds that range up to 2 gbps  we are also deploying wireless gateways to improve the performance of multiple ipenabled devices used at the same time within the home provide faster internet speeds and create an inhome wifi network customers with xfienabled wireless gateways may personalize and manage their wifi network remotely which includes viewing and changing their wifi password identifying which devices are connected to their inhome network setting parental controls and schedules as well as other features we believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our highspeed internet service and seek higherspeed offerings 

highspeed internet revenue increased 93  and 87  in 2018  and 2017  respectively primarily due to 

 video 

cable communications offers a broad variety of video services packages that may include premium networks payperview services and our on demand service our video customers may also subscribe for additional fees to our hd and dvr advanced services 

video revenue decreased 18  in 2018  primarily due to 

 video revenue increased 30  in 2017  primarily due to 

 as of december 31 2018  155 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 150 million customers and 148 million customers as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

we have experienced and expect that we will continue to experience declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline competition is intense both from traditional multichannel video providers and online video distribution services we believe our x1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs such as promotions bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments 

voice 

cable communications offers voice services that provide local and longdistance calling and other related features

business services revenue increased 107  and 128  in 2018  and 2017  respectively primarily due to 

 in 2018  2017  and 2016  revenue from our small business services offerings represented the majority of our total business services revenue we believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing we expect that the contribution to our growth rate from mediumsized and enterprise customers will increase relative to that of our smallbusiness customers as small business service matures

filmed entertainment segment – revenue 

theatrical 

theatrical revenue is generated from the worldwide theatrical release of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters and is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute as well as their acceptance by audiences theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens ticket prices the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released the success of a film in movie theaters is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms 

theatrical revenue decreased in 2018  primarily due to the timing of releases and the strong performance of prior year releases  which were partially offset by successful releases in the current year theatrical revenue increased in 2017  primarily due to the strong performances of several releases in our 2017 film slate the following key titles released in each respective fiscal year were contributors to the drivers of changes in revenue

consolidated adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure of performance and is defined as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax benefit expense investment and other income loss net interest expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and losses such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the 



capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities including the results of entities that we do not consolidate as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs additionally we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure of consolidated adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap 





our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations funding our capital expenditures investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders 

we also maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements our commercial paper programs provide a lowercost source of borrowing to fund our shortterm working capital requirements see note 7 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on the comcast nbcuniversal enterprise and sky revolving credit facilities and the related guarantees as of december 31 2018  amounts available under our consolidated revolving credit facilities net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit totaled   92 billion  which included 09 billion  available under the nbcuniversal enterprise revolving credit facility and 07 billion  available under the sky revolving credit facility 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we acquired a 100 interest in sky for total cash consideration of £302 billion  approximately 394 billion  using the exchange rates on the purchase dates to finance the acquisition we used funds from unsecured term loans and senior unsecured fixed and floating rate notes the unsecured term loans and senior notes are guaranteed by comcast cable and nbcuniversal the remaining amount of consideration was funded using cash on hand  as of october 9 2018 sky had outstanding indebtedness that is now consolidated in our financial statements with an aggregate fair value of approximately 112 billion  using the exchange rates as of such date which is not guaranteed by us comcast cable or nbcuniversal as of december 31 2018

operating activities 



the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily related to the timing of film and television costs at sky our broadcast of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics and continued growth in our wireless phone service offering partially offset by our broadcast of the 2018 super bowl the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to the timing of film and television production spending and related costs net of amortization the recognition of deferred revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics the payment in 2016 of a tax receivable agreement that dreamworks animation entered into with one of its former stockholders and the launch in 2017 of our wireless phone service offering 

the increases in interest payments in 2018  and 2017  were primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding including the issuance of new debt in 2018 associated with the financing of the sky transaction 

the decrease in income tax payments in 2018  was primarily due to federal income tax overpayments of 824 million related to the 2017 tax year that were applied to reduce tax payments in the current year as well as a reduction in the federal income tax rate and additional depreciation deductions allowed under the 2017 tax act this decrease was partially offset by higher taxable income from operations in the current year the increase in income tax payments in 2017  was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and payments associated with tax disputes partially offset by tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange and additional depreciation deductions allowed under the 2017 tax act

cable communications capital expenditures decreased 30  in 2018  primarily due to decreases in spending on customer premise equipment and support capital which were partially offset by increases due to our continued investment in scalable infrastructure and increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of business services cable communications capital expenditures increased 47  in 2017 primarily due to continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of business services and residential the increase in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in spending on customer premise equipment and support capital 



capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 152  to 17 billion  in 2018  primarily due to an increase in spending at our universal theme parks capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 34  to 15 billion  in 2017  primarily due to continued investment at our theme parks segment which was partially offset by the timing of real estate and infrastructure investment 

capital expenditures in our sky segment from october 9 2018 to december 31 2018 totaled 222 million  reflecting continued deployment of sky q 

we expect our capital expenditures for 2019  will be focused on continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our cable communications segment increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential and the continued deployment of wireless gateways our x1 platform cloud dvr technology sky q and international ott platforms in addition we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services the capacity required for existing services and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks

acquire handsets and other equipment and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business cable communications’ and sky’s programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming our purchase obligations related to our nbcuniversal and sky segments include commitments to acquire film and television programming including broadcast rights relating to sporting events such as the olympics as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements including obligations to actors producers and television personalities and various other television commitments purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments 

 



as of december 31 2018  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



see note 9 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 8 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to revenue recognition 



  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as a result of the sky transaction one additional area has been identified as critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the one additional critical accounting judgment and estimate is the valuation of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 4 8 and 12 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 



valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but we assess their carrying values annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2018  we performed a quantitative assessment of our cable franchise rights based on this assessment the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the northeast central and west divisions by 29 46 and 58 respectively 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights 

we could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights in addition a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 



5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own including rights to multiyear liveevent sports programming at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear liveevent sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract 

capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented 

fair value of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values in determining fair value management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain as part of the estimation process thirdparty valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities 

our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of acquired assets and liabilities as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for instance the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

due to the timing of the sky acquisition the allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimates and is subject to change below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain of sky’s assets and liabilities for which preliminary estimates were determined other assets such as property and equipment have been recorded based on historical cost as no better estimate was available as of december 31 2018 

intangible assets 

intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finitelived customer relationships and indefinitelived trade names 

customer relationships were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about future events including attrition contract renewal estimates and technology changes 

in determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finitelived intangibles we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset 

trade names were valued using the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market assumptions when available 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



  

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 



our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2018  to 815 from 828 

the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease our consolidated interest expense by 6 million 23 million and 36 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our consolidated interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2018  by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt notional amount of our interest rate instruments effective rates and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us   



the average interest rates on our debt in the table above reflect the effects of our derivative financial instruments we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2018  plus the applicable borrowing margin the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument is used to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest 

see note 1 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 



we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states through sky and nbcuniversal and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of nonfunctional currency denominated assets liabilities commitments and forecasted nonfunctional currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances we enter into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of 58 billion and 13 billion respectively including contracts at nbcuniversal of 12 billion and 13 billion respectively as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we use crosscurrency swaps for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these crosscurrency swaps generally offset changes in the underlying value of the related exposures as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had crosscurrency swaps on 53 billion and 08 billion notional amount of our foreign currency denominated 



debt respectively as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the aggregate fair value of these crosscurrency swaps was a net liability of 23 million and 80 million respectively   

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations beginning in 2018 we use foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps to hedge our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries as of december 31 2018  we had 156 billion notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps designated as net investment hedges of our foreign subsidiaries 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of december 31 2018  including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10 shift in currency exchange rates inclusive of the effects of derivatives the results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2018  net income attributable to comcast corporation 



we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

our theme parks segment consists primarily of our universal theme parks in orlando florida hollywood california and osaka japan universal orlando includes two theme parks universal studios florida and universal’s islands of adventure our water park volcano bay which opened in may 2017 as well as universal citywalk orlando a dining retail and entertainment complex universal orlando also features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest our universal theme park in hollywood california consists primarily of universal studios hollywood as well as universal citywalk hollywood our universal theme park in osaka japan consists primarily of universal studios japan we continue to expand our theme parks business internationally such as through our plans to develop a universal theme park in beijing china along with a consortium of chinese stateowned companies in addition we license the right to use the universal studios brand name and other intellectual property and also provide other services to third parties that own and operate the universal studios singapore theme park on sentosa island singapore 

our theme parks segment licenses the right to use a substantial amount of intellectual property from third parties for its themed elements in rides attractions and merchandising 



our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of comcast spectacor which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia pennsylvania and operates arena managementrelated businesses  

we are also pursuing other business development initiatives such as our wireless phone service that we launched in the second quarter of 2017  using our virtual network operator rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network and our existing network of inhome and outdoor wifi hotspots we offer the wireless phone service only as part of our bundled service offerings to residential customers that subscribe to our highspeed internet service within our cable distribution footprint and may in the future also offer wireless phone service to our small business customers on similar terms the wireless phone service has successbased working capital requirements primarily associated with the procurement of handsets which customers are able to pay for upfront or finance interestfree over 24 months and other equipment 

competition 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information products and services to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models in particular consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our highspeed internet services more valuable to consumers in addition the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming 



competition for our cable services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete in all of our service areas and phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 60 of our service areas and are continuing to expand the areas they serve many of these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for these services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer and some of these traditional competitors also offer smaller onlineonly video packages many of these competitors also have significant financial resources att which owns directv announced in 2016 a proposed merger with time warner inc a media and entertainment company which competes with our nbcuniversal businesses 

current and future wireless internet services such as 3g 4g and 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless phones and internetbased phone services such as skype 

there also continue to be new companies some with significant financial resources that offer or are seeking to offer services that potentially may compete with some or all of our cable services for example companies continue to emerge that provide internet 



streaming and downloading of video programming some of which charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages additionally google has launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services including 

 phone companies such as att centurylink frontier and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure farther into their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional digital subscriber line “dsl” technology and are offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 

google has launched a fibertothehome network that provides highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g and in the near future 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers as well as wireless data cards a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports also offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

voice services 

our voice services compete with wireline and wireless phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” and competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies 



such as the ilecs att and verizon have longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internetbased phone services 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses 



cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks subscription video on demand services local broadcast television stations home entertainment products payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content gaming products and other forms of entertainment news and information 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and subscription video on demand services the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and the distribution of its films on premium networks and on subscription video on demand services 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities to help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions hotels and infrastructure 



our cable communications business cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations declines in audience ratings also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available including content from subscription video on demand services and other online sources in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services that give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming 



seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and refer to the “seasonality and cyclicality” discussion within that section for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses our businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities in addition we must comply with provisions of the consent decree entered into in connection with the acquisition of nbcuniversal the “nbcuniversal consent decree” in september 2011 which is scheduled to expire in september 2018 the conditions and commitments pursuant to the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction “nbcuniversal order” expired in january 2018 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses the fcc and certain states have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation and they along with some state attorney generals have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should overrule the fcc’s action in 2017 repealing regulation of our broadband internet access service under title ii of the communications act whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 



video services 

program carriage 

cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network in addition fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future   

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations in late 2017 the fcc adopted an order relaxing the broadcast media ownership rules and is considering additional revisions to the rules which could lead to further broadcast television station consolidation the fcc also adopted an order authorizing voluntary implementation of a new broadcast technical standard that permits broadcasters to seek carriage of signals using the new standard through retransmission consent together these actions may impact retransmission consent negotiations and the fees we pay broadcasters for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments  broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section   



pricing and packaging 

the fcc’s rate regulations create a presumption that all local communities are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limits prices cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation the fcc has accepted a certification from a massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in a number of the communities we serve in massachusetts allowing for continued rate regulation in those communities all of the other areas we serve have unregulated prices in addition to the fcc’s rate regulation rules certain state entities monitor and may challenge the marketing and advertising of our services for example in 2016 the washington state attorney general filed a lawsuit currently being litigated in state court alleging that our service protection plan an optional plan that protects customers from incurring charges for service visits to diagnose and repair installed inhome wiring for residential cable services violates state consumer protection laws 

pole attachments 

the fcc regulates the rates terms and conditions that most poleowning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers for allowing attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rates terms and conditions of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments some municipalities have enacted “onetouch” makeready pole attachment ordinances which permit third parties to alter components of our network attached to utility poles in ways that could adversely affect our businesses one of these ordinances in a state that has preempted fcc jurisdiction has been upheld by a federal district court in a challenge brought by another provider but another ordinance in a state that did not preempt fcc jurisdiction has been vacated by a federal district court in a challenge brought by us as inconsistent with the fcc’s pole attachment rules in 2017 the fcc initiated a rulemaking that considers amending its pole attachment rules to permit a “onetouch” like makeready process for the poles within its jurisdiction if adopted these rules could have a similar effect as the municipal onetouch makeready ordinances and adversely affect our businesses 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal including unreasonable renewal conditions we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise 

approximately half of the states in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirements for new entrants some allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain states allow incumbent cable operators such as us to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued although even in those states incumbent cable operators may be required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services to our customers many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below as an internet service provider “isp” we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligations on isps new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses 

open internet regulations 

we have committed to be bound by “open internet” regulations enacted by the fcc in 2010 as a condition of the nbcuniversal consent decree until september 2018 even though some of the rules were subsequently overturned on appeal as a result we are prohibited from blocking access to lawful internet content applications services or nonharmful devices and unreasonably discriminating in the transmission of lawful internet traffic in addition under the fcc’s 2010 transparency rule that was upheld on appeal we are required to disclose our network management practices performance and commercial terms of our internet services in addition to the commitments made as part of the nbcuniversal acquisition we have publicly committed to not block throttle or discriminate against lawful internet traffic and to be transparent with our customers about our open internet practices 



in 2015 the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act these included among other things prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services “throttling” prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration “paid prioritization” and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or edge providers’ ability to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers “general conduct” 

in december 2017 the fcc adopted an order eliminating title ii regulation of broadband internet access service as well as its prior noblocking nothrottling no paidprioritization and general conduct rules stating that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the ftc in addition the order revised the transparency rule to require isps to disclose any blocking and throttling practices and any paid prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings the fcc retained authority to enforce compliance with the transparency rule accordingly after the order goes into effect isp conduct will be subject to review by the ftc the ftc will be able to enforce the public commitments we have made to not block throttle or discriminate against lawful internet traffic and the fcc will enforce compliance with its new transparency rule the order also preempted any state and local laws and regulations that conflict with the fcc’s deregulatory policies certain parties have already indicated they intend to appeal the fcc’s order in federal court in addition congress may consider legislation addressing these regulations and the classification of broadband internet access services and legislators in numerous states have stated that they will introduce legislation to impose open internet protections in a variety of ways we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation 

broadband deploymentinfrastructure initiatives 

in 2017 the fcc initiated proceedings intended to remove barriers to deploying nextgeneration wireless and wireline broadband infrastructure these proceedings may result in changes to the fcc’s rules related to the deployment of broadband infrastructure as well as preemption of any state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of broadband infrastructure we cannot predict whether or how any fcc rules might be changed how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted or how such changes may affect our business 

nbcuniversal consent decree 

the nbcuniversal consent decree includes various conditions requiring us to maintain a broadband internet access service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to avoid discrimination in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our broadband internet access service but not including our broadband internet access service video services or voice services 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of governmentowned networks although some may choose to ease or facilitate such networks in addition as part of any federal infrastructure program governmental subsidies or funding of additional internet broadband networks may be encouraged we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business 

voice services 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations rural call completion backup power service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level 

voice interconnection 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services providers of voip services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec which has the right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies we have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated clecs if a regulatory or judicial 



authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic and has affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers 

wireless service 

in 2017 we began offering a wireless voice and data service we offer this service using our mobile virtual network operator “mvno” rights to provide the service over verizon’s wireless network and our existing network of inhome and outdoor wifi hotspots mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilitiesbased wireless carriers eg e911 services local number portability etc as well as certain state or local regulations the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos andor mobile broadband providers in the future or impose new taxes or fees which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally 

universal service 

the federal universal service program generally requires us and other phone service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their interstate and international services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of voice services and broadbandcapable voice networks in highcost areas the provision of voice services to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet voice and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers some states also have analogous programs that support service in highcost areas or to lowincome consumers the fcc has long considered implementing changes to the universal service program such as changing the fee calculation from a revenuebased formula to a peruser fee or perconnection fee adopting a fee based on bandwidth and expanding the services subject to the fee to include broadband internet access services we are unable to predict if or how the fcc may change the universal service program or the effects any such changes would have on our businesses 

the fcc recently has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing deployment of broadbandcapable networks and broadband facilities this shift could assist some of our competitors for example the fcc has revised the highcost federal universal service mechanism to support broadbandcapable networks and substantially has revised the program that provides universal service support for services to schools and libraries to begin phasing out support for voice services with greater support directed to broadband services and the deployment of wifi networks similarly the fcc has expanded its lifeline subsidy program for lowincome consumers to include broadband services in addition to voice services the fcc or congress may revisit these subsidy programs and how they are funded we cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed in the future 



cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds 

the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with online video distributors we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and when requested individually 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “internet distribution” discussion within that section 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age 



broadcast television 

licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions substantially all of our broadcast television station licenses have pending applications for renewal although our stations’ authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is under review several of these applications have been opposed by third parties although our licenses have been renewed in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific ownership levels in local television stations in november 2017 the fcc adopted an order eliminating certain limitations on ownership of television stations and other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast television stations and newspapers in the same market elimination of these limits is subject to judicial appeal in 2018 the fcc is expected to initiate its quadrennial review of its media ownership regulations 

local television ownership 

the fcc recently revised its rules to generally permit a licensee to own up to two broadcast stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the dma based on audience share in addition the new rules permit a licensee to own up to two stations ranked in the top four in a dma based on a casebycase analysis of the circumstances surrounding the proposed combination these recent changes are subject to judicial appeal these   ownership restrictions do not apply if the signal coverage of the stations involved do not overlap in the same market 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households the fcc also has a rule that affords a 50 discount to uhf stations channels 14 and above in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap the fcc has initiated a proceeding to consider whether to retain the 50 discount and whether to modify the national television ownership limit our owned broadcast television station reach does not exceed the current limit even without considering the discount for uhf stations but elimination of the 50 discount without an increase in the 39 national cap would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast television station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest 

dual network rule 

each of the four major broadcast television networks  abc cbs fox and nbc  is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

must carryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either must carry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent 

internet distribution 

the nbcuniversal consent decree establishes certain obligations and restraints concerning distribution of our content online we must make available certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes over access to such programming we are one of four owners of hulu but we have no voting rights or board representation under the terms of the nbcuniversal consent decree we have entered into license agreements with hulu on substantially the same terms as its other owners 



indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures in countries outside the united states a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards as well as liquor licenses 



intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively affect their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations while the royalties we contribute to the copyright royalty pool for broadcast signals can be challenged by copyright owners in annual audits and we cannot predict what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them in addition the copyright office has initiated a rulemaking to consider how royalty payments to content owners are calculated under the compulsory license we cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking but there is a risk that it could result in higher royalty payments to content owners furthermore in response to a 2014 fcc decision eliminating the fcc’s “sports blackout” rule which previously enabled sports teams to insist that cable operators black out sports events not available on local broadcast signals the leading sports leagues petitioned the copyright royalty board to impose a copyright surcharge on cable operators to compensate sports teams for the loss of programming exclusivity and that proceeding is now pending 

there has been litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates in 2014 the us supreme court ruled that one such entity aereo violated broadcasters’ exclusive right to perform their copyrighted works publicly subsequently aereo sought to operate as a cable system under the copyright act although the us copyright office rejected its application for a compulsory copyright license other companies have sought legislation or court rulings to obtain a compulsory license to stream broadcast programming online 



privacy and data security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

the fcc’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband internet access service as an “information service” has the effect of reinstating the ftc’s authority to regulate isps’ privacy protections and their use and disclosure of certain customer information the ftc generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections by using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers one court decision from a panel of judges in the ninth circuit has raised questions regarding the extent of ftc jurisdiction over companies like us whose service offerings include some common carrier services as well as noncommon carrier services however that panel’s decision is not in effect and has no precedential effect pending a final decision from the full ninth circuit court of appeals after a rehearing en banc   

numerous states and localities in response to congressional action in 2017 to rescind new isp privacy rules adopted by the fcc regarding the use and disclosure of certain customer information have considered legislative or other action that would impose new requirements on our collection use and disclosure of certain customer information the fcc’s 2017 open internet order however contained broad preemption language that preempts state and local regulations that conflict with federal deregulatory policy which these state and local efforts may do we expect these efforts to continue in 2018 although we cannot predict whether such efforts will be successful or preempted or if successful how any new requirements may affect our business 

we are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age other privacyoriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits including class actions against providers of video materials online 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts and sms messages the ftc and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information even in an aggregated noncustomeridentifiable form which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

we are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach and the fcc has adopted security breach rules for voice services several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information including the proper disposal of consumer information 

the national institute of standards and technology “nist” in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of us critical infrastructure including us have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized flexible repeatable performancebased and costeffective approach to cybersecurity risk it is a compendium of existing crosssector cyberdefense processes practices and protocols that can help companies identify assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities and several government agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework nist recently proposed draft updates to this voluntary framework and is currently reviewing feedback on the draft 

there are pending federal legislative proposals that if enacted could create new online consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure including us we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted and if so the impact of any such laws on our business

congress authorized the fcc to conduct an auction to repurpose some broadcast spectrum to mobile broadband use in this auction the fcc offered licensees of fullpower and class a television stations the opportunity to sell some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for cash and it repackaged those spectrum rights and sold new licenses to wireless providers who can use them for mobile broadband services in the auction nbcuniversal sold broadcast spectrum rights associated with television stations in three of its markets receiving proceeds of approximately 482 million those stations which must vacate their current channels by april 23 2018 will continue to operate by sharing channels with other nbcuniversal stations in those markets the fcc assigned 19 of nbcuniversal’s other television stations that did not sell their spectrum rights to new channels those stations will have to transition to their new channels in a postauction repacking process that is scheduled to conclude in the third quarter 2020 



and the fcc will reimburse those stations for a portion of their reasonable relocation costs subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of 175 billion as a result of the repacking process comcast will have to make changes to its cable systems to accommodate broadcasters on their newly assigned channels and will be reimbursed by the fcc for a portion of those related costs subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of 175 billion 

in addition we acquired 73 new mobile broadband licenses in this auction for 17 billion we will be obligated to meet certain regulatory requirements concerning the use of these licenses over the coming years 

fcc 5g spectrum proceedings and other wireless regulations 

in three separate regulatory proceedings the fcc is currently considering establishing andor modifying its rules to make available large amounts of spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services both fixed and mobile commonly referred to as 5g services some of this spectrum is currently used for satellite delivery of cable programming to cable headends including our own and there is a risk that such satellite delivery could be disrupted if the fcc were to adopt some of the proposals raised in these proceedings there is also a risk that the fcc could adopt proposals that favor certain business models over others in the 5g marketplace thereby limiting potential business opportunities for us in the future in addition there is potential for new legislation or fcc regulations that could enable wireless providers to offer video and other services over their networks subject to different and possibly fewer regulatory obligations than the services we provide we cannot predict what rules or legislation if any will ultimately be adopted or how any such changes would affect our businesses 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges was made permanent by 2016 legislation however some jurisdictions have or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by internet tax freedom act 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs 

other regulations 

federal regulators actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring cable equipment leased access loudness of commercial advertisements advertising emergency alert system equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions we also are subject to various international regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 164000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 91000 and 62000 were associated with our cable communications business and our nbcuniversal businesses respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 



caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers online distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading “changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 

competition for our cable services consists primarily of dbs providers and phone companies with fiberbased networks that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours some of these competitors are also offering smaller packages of channels at price points lower than our standard packages both through traditional and online distribution platforms which could cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable att our largest phone company competitor acquired directv the nation’s largest dbs provider in 2015 to create an even larger competitor and in 2016 announced a proposed merger with time warner a media and entertainment company if consolidation between phone companies which are also wireless distributors and content providers occurs some of our competitors may offer free or lower cost streaming services for viewing their content through unlimited datausage plans for their internet or wireless phone services additional companies some with significant financial resources continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market primarily by offering internet streaming and downloading of video programming 

wireless internet services such as 3g and 4g and in the near future 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as smartphones tablets wireless data cards and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our wireline voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and internetbased phone services 

our cable communications business continues to seek ways to enhance the value of our cable services network such as by growing our highspeed internet services and business services and by launching additional services such as our security and automation services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications segment revenue maintain our cable communications segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent content and other resources required in operating these businesses 

the ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and government authorities our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or newer competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 



changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services 

consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our highspeed internet services more important to consumers while we are attempting to adapt our video service offerings to changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology and adding apps such as netflix on our x1 settop boxes virtual multichannel video providers subscription video on demand services and programming networks that provide content directly to consumers over the internet continue to gain consumer acceptance many of these service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video services including for expanded video packages premium networks and our dvr and on demand services 

an increasing number of companies offering subscription video on demand services including some that also offer exclusive highquality original video programming as well as programming networks offering content directly to consumers over the internet have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choices adversely affects the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming timeshifting technologies such as video on demand services and dvr and cloudbased recording services also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our cable networks and broadcast television programming and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of its content 

the success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital media radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and audience fragmentation the growing use of new technologies and online distribution platforms or the economy in general in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which many of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as viewing content through many online distribution platforms or delayed viewing on dvrs might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of docsis 31 and docsis fdx and the continued development of our x1 settop boxes cloud dvr and wireless gateways there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures 



we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video highspeed internet and voice services industries our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels in addition we are subject to conditions relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters set forth in the nbcuniversal consent decree which is currently scheduled to expire in september 2018 the fcc and certain states also have been active in conducting inquiries   and reviews regarding our services and this trend may continue failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirements and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communications segment’s video business 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase for the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming especially sports programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally in the past few years we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment’s results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the 



other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses are also entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including subscription video on demand services if our programming does not attract sufficient viewers traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute our broadcast and cable networks and subscription video on demand services may not license programming we create in addition the number of subscribers to our cable networks may be reduced as a result of multichannel video providers offering smaller packages of channels as part of their virtual or traditional television programming packages and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current threeyear period which commenced on january 1 2018 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce nbcuniversal’s revenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery and technology embedded in our products and services are critical to our business activities cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks information systems and other technologies network information systems and technologyrelated events including those caused by us such as process breakdowns security architecture or design vulnerabilities or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services excessive call volume to call centers theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets a reduction in demand for our theme parks disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment data properties and reputation these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties products services networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we may obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems 



or our products services or operations while we develop and maintain systems and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united states hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and its success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation  other areas of regulation  intellectual property” discussion for additional information 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as subscription video on demand services or substitute services for our highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones smartphones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative 



impact on our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance any existing debt on acceptable terms 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives for example our launch of a wireless phone service in 2017 using virtual network operator rights has successbased working capital requirements primarily associated with the procurement of handsets which customers are able to pay for upfront or finance interestfree over 24 months and other equipment which could have negative effects on our cash flows additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest as well as corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur our businesses may be adversely affected

2017  developments 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2017  

cable communications segment 

 nbcuniversal segments 

 corporate and other 

 competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models in particular consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our highspeed internet services more valuable to consumers in addition the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming 

for additional information on the competition our businesses face see item 1 business and item 1a risk factors within the business section refer to the “competition” discussion and within the risk factors section refer to the risk factors entitled “our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 



seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the us is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue in the us is also cyclical with a benefit in evennumbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year 

our revenue and operating costs and expenses comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments and the super bowl which affects our broadcast television segment in particular our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of films released in movie theaters on standarddefinition digital video discs and bluray discs together “dvds” and through various other distribution platforms release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season content licensing revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season

consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2017  and 2016  primarily due to increases in capital expenditures as well as expenditures for software in our cable communications segment in recent years we continue to invest to increase our network capacity and in customer premise equipment primarily for our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways certain of these assets in our cable communications segment have relatively short estimated useful lives which increased depreciation expense in 2017 and 2016 and will continue to increase depreciation expense in 2018  nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to our continued investment in new attractions in our theme parks segment including for universal studios japan 



consolidated other operating gains

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding for multiple dwelling units “mdus” including buildings located on college campuses whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services such as additional programming choices or our highdefinition video “hd” or digital video recorder “dvr” advanced services we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services the mdu is counted as a single customer in 2017 we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service residential video and highspeed internet customers as of december 31 2017 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 3000  and 60000  respectively customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services single product double product and triple and quad product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one two or three and four of our cable services respectively beginning in 2017 we include customers subscribing to our security and automation services in customer relationship information all periods presented have been adjusted for the inclusion of security and automation customers 



cable communications segment – revenue 

video 

our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video services packages that may include premium networks payperview services and our on demand service our video customers may subscribe for additional fees to our hd and dvr advanced services we continue to deploy settop boxes for our internet protocol “ip” and cloudenabled video platform referred to as our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology throughout our footprint 

video revenue increased 35  and 39  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the increases in revenue in both years were primarily due to rate adjustments and increases in the number of residential customers subscribing to additional services such as premium channels and advanced services which accounted for substantially all of the increases in both 2017  and 2016  the increase in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in the number of residential video customers as of december 31 2017  150 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 148 million customers and 139 million customers as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments competition is intense both from traditional multichannel video providers and from new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content we are responding to this competition and have attempted to mitigate industrywide declines in residential video customers at traditional multichannel video providers through our x1 platform and sales and marketing programs such as promotions bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments as of december 31 2017  391  of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 399  and 401  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

highspeed internet 

we offer highspeed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second “gbps” and fiberbased speeds that range up to 2 gbps throughout our footprint we continue to deploy wireless gateways that combine a customer’s wireless router cable modem and voice adapter to improve the performance of multiple ipenabled devices used at the same time within the home provide faster internet speeds and create an inhome wifi network we continue to expand our network of residential outdoor and business wifi hotspots to allow most of our highspeed internet customers to access our highspeed internet services inside and outside the home as of december 31 2017 there were approximately 188 million of these hotspots  

highspeed internet revenue increased 91  and 85  in 2017  and 2016  respectively increases in the number of residential customers receiving our highspeed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 51 and 58 in 2017  and 2016  respectively the remaining increases in revenue in both 2017  and 2016  were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving higher levels of service and the impact of rate adjustments 

we believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our highspeed internet service and seek higherspeed offerings as of december 31 2017  452  of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 438  and 419  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

voice 

we offer voice services that provide local and longdistance calling and other related features 

voice revenue decreased 42  and 19  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the decreases were primarily due to the allocation of voice revenue for our customers who receive bundled services the amount allocated to voice revenue in the rate charged for bundled services decreased in both years because video and highspeed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat the decrease in revenue in 2017 was also partially due to a decrease in the number of residential voice customers which may continue to decline 

as of december 31 2017  202  of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services compared to 207  and 206  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

business services 

we offer a variety of products and services to meet the demands of businesses with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gbps and fiberbased speeds that range up to 10 gbps our small business services offerings primarily include highspeed internet services as well as voice and video services similar to those that we provide to our residential customers and also include cloudbased solutions that provide file sharing online backup and web conferencing among other features we also offer ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to mediumsized customers and larger enterprises as well as advanced voice services in addition we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help these customers manage their network bandwidth 



recently we have expanded our enterprise service offerings to include a softwaredefined networking product and our managed solutions business to offer enterprise customers support related to wifi networks router management network security business continuity risks and other services we primarily offer our enterprise service offerings to fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our cable distribution footprint where we have agreements with other companies to use their networks to provide coverage outside of our service areas 

business services revenue increased 127  and 161  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the increases in 2017  and 2016  were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving our small business services offerings as well as our mediumsized business services offerings in 2017  2016  and 2015  revenue from our small business services offerings represented the majority of our total business services revenue we believe the increases in the number of business customers were primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing although the rate of growth in the number of our small business customers may slow as the business matures 

advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell through our advertising business to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising units are sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service  advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market general economic conditions and cyclicality related to political campaigns and issueoriented advertising 

advertising revenue decreased 88  in 2017  primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased 111  in 2016  primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising decreased 16 in 2017 and increased slightly in 2016 

in 2017  5 of our cable communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our nbcuniversal segments compared to 5 and 6 in 2016  and 2015  respectively these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

other 

other revenue primarily includes revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees we also receive revenue related to fees from other services such as our security and automation services cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our cable franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue  the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue to which the fees apply 

other revenue increased 48  and 122  in 2017  and 2016  respectively primarily due to increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees revenue from our security and automation services and our x1 licensing agreements

technical and product support expenses 

technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities as well as costs for network operations product development fulfillment and provisioning technical and product support expenses increased in 2017  and 2016  primarily due to expenses related to the development deployment and support of our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways and continued growth in business services and security and automation services the increase in 2016 was also due to expenses related to investments to improve the customer experience 



customer service expenses 

customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity customer service expenses remained relatively flat in 2017 primarily due to reduced call volumes which were partially offset by increased personnel costs customer service expenses increased in 2016 primarily due to increased support for improving the customer experience and increases in total labor costs which reflected sales and support activities associated with the deployment of our x1 platform and wireless gateways and growth in business services and security and automation services

theatrical revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to the strong performances of several releases in our 2017 film slate including the fate of the furious despicable me 3 and  fifty shades darker  theatrical revenue decreased in 2016 primarily due to the strong performance of our larger 2015 film slate including furious 7 jurassic world  and minions  partially offset by the strong performance of the secret life of pets and sing  in 2016

investment income loss net 

the change in investment income loss net in 2017  was not significant the change in investment income loss net in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in income of certain investments and gains recorded on the sale of certain investments the components of investment income loss net are presented in a table in note 7 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

equity in net income losses of investees net 

the changes in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2017  and 2016  were primarily due to our equity method investments in atairos group inc and hulu llc atairos which commenced operations in 2016  follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income we recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income losses of investees net the losses at hulu were driven by its higher programming and marketing costs the table below summarizes the equity in net income losses of atairos and hulu in 2017  2016  and 2015 





the change in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2016  was also due to an impairment charge related to goodwill recorded by the weather channel in 2015  we recorded expenses of 333 million  that represented nbcuniversal’s proportionate share of the weather channel impairment charge

income tax benefit expense reflects federal and state income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions our effective income tax rate in 2017  was a benefit of 495  excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 333 our effective income tax rate in 2016  and 2015  was an expense of 370  and 371  respectively the income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily driven by the enactment of new federal tax reform legislation in december 2017 “2017 tax act” partially offset by higher taxable income from operations the 2017 tax act among other things reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 resulting in a net income tax benefit of 127 billion in 2017 primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability see note 14 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

additionally in 2017 we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of 297 million  see note 3 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements our income tax benefit also increased 121 million due to the impact of an internal legal reorganization in the third quarter of 2017 which was partially offset by a decrease of 53 million due to changes in state tax laws 

we expect our 2018  annual effective tax rate to be significantly lower than our current year effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation as a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate in the 2017 tax act 



the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2017 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interests in universal studios japan that we did not already own in april 2017 the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2016  was primarily due to nbcuniversal’s acquisition of a 51 interest in universal studios japan in november 2015 



consolidated adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure of performance and is defined as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock income tax benefit expense total other income expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains and excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of longlived assets if any from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of events gains losses or other charges such as significant legal settlements that affect the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating performance this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies we reconcile consolidated adjusted 



ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap

operating activities 



the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to the timing of film and television production spending and related costs net of amortization the recognition of deferred revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics the payment in 2016 of a tax receivable agreement that dreamworks animation entered into with one of its former stockholders and the launch in 2017 of our wireless phone service offering the variance in changes in

the increases in interest payments in 2017  and 2016  were primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding 

the increase in income tax payments in 2017  was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and payments associated with tax disputes offset by tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange see note 10 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and additional depreciation deductions allowed under the 2017 tax act see note 14 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements the decrease in income tax payments in 2016  was primarily due to taxable losses in 2016 related to the sale of certain investments as well as taxable gains in 2015 related to the sale of businesses and investments partially offset by higher taxable income from operations in 2016 we expect income tax payments to be significantly lower in 2018  due to the reduction in the federal income tax rate as well as additional depreciation deductions allowed under the 2017 tax act partially offset by the 2017 tax deductions resulting from the senior notes exchange

refer to note 10 and note 16 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 





to comcast’s consolidated financial statements our contractual obligations do not include certain expenditures related to the construction and development of the universal studios theme park in beijing china as these commitments were not executed as of december 31 2017 

 



as of december 31 2017  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



see note 3 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to revenue recognition 



  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 9 and 6 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but we assess their carrying values annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant 



judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2014 the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 26 42 and 50 respectively we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment in 2017  including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment market transactions and macroeconomic conditions weightedaverage cost of capital and an increase in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights 

we could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights in addition a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own including rights to multiyear liveevent sports programming at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear liveevent sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract 

capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



  

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program comcast’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of comcast’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2017  to 868 from 895 as of december 31 2017  nbcuniversal had no outstanding interest rate derivative financial instruments 

in 2017  2016  and 2015  the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease comcast’s consolidated interest expense by 23 million 36 million and 62 million respectively the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on comcast’s interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2017  by contractual year of maturity the principal cash flows notional amounts fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us   



we use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2017  plus the applicable borrowing margin 

see note 2 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 



nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations nbcuniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency nbcuniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of nonfunctional currency denominated assets liabilities commitments and forecasted nonfunctional currency revenue and expenses in accordance with 



our policy nbcuniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances nbcuniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2017  and 2016  nbcuniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 13 billion and 15 billion respectively as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2017  including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between the functional currency and the us dollar our analysis of such a shift in exchange rates indicated that it would not have a material effect on our 2017  net income attributable to comcast corporation in addition the impact of fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar for our nonus dollar functional currency operations did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in 2017  

comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations we use crosscurrency swaps for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was a liability of 80 million and 189 million respectively 



comcast and nbcuniversal manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant comcast has agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2017  and 2016  comcast was not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

competition for our cable services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete in all of our service areas and phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 60 of our service areas and are continuing to expand the areas they serve many of these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for these services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer and some of these traditional competitors also offer smaller onlineonly video packages in 2015 att one of our largest phone company competitors acquired directv the nation’s largest dbs provider which created an even larger competitor to our cable services and has enabled it to enhance its bundled offerings with video highspeed internet and wireline and wireless phone services att also announced in 2016 a proposed merger with time warner inc a media and entertainment company which competes with our nbcuniversal businesses 

current and future wireless internet services such as 3g 4g and 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless phones and internetbased phone services such as skype 

  

 

 there also continue to be new companies some with significant financial resources that offer or are seeking to offer services that potentially may compete with some or all of our cable services for example google has launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and other companies continue to emerge that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 some phone companies such as att centurylink frontier and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure farther into their networks which allows them to provide data trans 

  

 

 mission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional digital subscriber line “dsl” technology and are now offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 

google has launched a fibertothehome network that provides highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g and in the future 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers as well as wireless data cards a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports also offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

voice services 

our voice services compete with wireline and wireless phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” and competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internetbased phone services 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks subscription video on demand services local broadcast television stations home entertainment products payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content gaming products and other forms of entertainment news and information 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and subscription video on demand services the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 

  

 

 in addition our cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for premium network and digital distribution of its films 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities to help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions hotels and infrastructure 

advertising 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming from subscription video on demand services and from other online programming 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and refer to the “seasonality and cyclicality” discussion within that section for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses our businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities in addition we must comply with the terms conditions and commitments of the fcc order that approved the nbcuniversal transaction in january 2011 the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the department of justice “doj” and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” in september 2011 which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years thereafter 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or 

  

 

 prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses in addition in recent years the fcc and certain states have been more active in considering rulemakings and legislation as well as in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant congress may consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should address the fcc’s authority to implement or enforce open internet regulations and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses in addition with the new administration in place the fcc and other agencies may pursue new regulations or seek changes to or the elimination of existing regulations such as the classification of broadband internet service and requirements relating to the internet and privacy we cannot predict what changes will be sought and if adopted how they will affect our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 

cable communications segment 

 

video services 

program carriage 

cable operators and other multichannel video providers are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network in addition fcc regulations as well as the nbcuniversal order prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments — broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

in 2015 the fcc revised its rate regulations to create a presumption that all local communities are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limits prices cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation that decision has been appealed in federal court while the fcc has accepted a certification from a massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in a number of the communities we serve in massachusetts that will allow for 

  

 

 continued rate regulation in those communities all of the other areas we serve are unregulated in addition to the fcc’s rate regulation rules certain state entities monitor and may challenge the marketing and advertising of our services for example in 2016 the washington state attorney general filed suit in state court alleging our service protection plan an optional plan that protects customers from incurring charges for service visits to diagnose and repair installed inhome wiring for residential cable services violates state consumer protection laws 

cable equipment 

the communications act includes provisions aimed at promoting the retail availability of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services in 2016 the fcc launched a rulemaking to consider proposed technology mandates on multichannel video providers aimed at enabling thirdparty retail video devices to access a provider’s video service without the need for a providersupplied settop box if implemented these mandates would impose substantial costs on us impair our ability to innovate and have other adverse effects on our business it is unclear whether the fcc under the new administration will pursue this proceeding or adopt these rules 

pole attachments 

the fcc regulates the rates terms and conditions that most poleowning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers including broadband internet access service providers such as us for allowing attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rates terms and conditions of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments in 2015 the fcc eliminated the ability of utility companies to justify higher rates for telecommunication service pole attachments cable operators had requested this fcc action because the fcc’s new open internet regulations as described below under the heading “open internet regulations” reclassified internet access service as a telecommunications service which could have allowed for higher rental rates to be applied to a majority of our pole attachments the fcc’s order ensuring that pole rates for telecommunications service attachments approximate the cable service pole rate has been appealed in federal court by the utility companies some municipalities have enacted “onetouch” make ready pole attachment ordinances which permit third parties to alter components of our network attached to utility poles in ways that could adversely affect our businesses we and other providers have filed complaints in federal court challenging these ordinances 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise 

approximately half of the states in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirements for new entrants some allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain states allow incumbent cable operators such as us to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later 

  

 

 when a competing state franchise has been issued although even in those states incumbent cable operators may be required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services to our customers many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below including open internet regulations prescribed by the fcc and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act as an internet service provider “isp” we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligations on isps including for example proposals to require broadband network outage reporting new broadband regulations if adopted may have adverse effects on our businesses 

open internet regulations 

in 2015 the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act including requirements that charges and practices of isps for and in connection with broadband internet access service be just reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory however the fcc refrained from implementing a number of utilitystyle regulations that might otherwise apply under title ii such as rate regulation tariffs and unbundling requirements 

the new open internet regulations bar isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices prohibit isps from impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services or impairing or degrading the use of nonharmful devices prohibit isps from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of internet content applications or services called an “edge provider” over lawful traffic of another edge provider in exchange for consideration “paid prioritization” establish a new “general conduct standard” that prohibits isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumers to select access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or of edge providers to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers and require isps to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service in addition interconnection arrangements which govern how internet traffic is exchanged between highspeed internet networks and provide direct dedicated interconnection capacity to edge providers are now subject to fcc oversight under title ii of the communications act all of these regulations are subject to fcc enforcement and could give rise to thirdparty claims for damages or equitable relief these requirements could adversely affect our business although the extent to which they do so will depend upon the manner in which the fcc interprets and enforces them 

in june 2016 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the fcc’s new open internet regulations on appeal petitions have been filed requesting a rehearing of the decision in addition congress may consider legislation addressing these regulations and the fcc under the new administration may also revisit the rules we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed states have attempted and may continue to attempt to use the fcc’s open internet decision to justify imposing new regulations and taxes and fees on isps that could adversely affect our business 

separate and apart from the fcc’s new open internet regulations we committed to be bound by the fcc’s original “open internet” regulations adopted in 2010 as a condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree until 2018 although we did not agree to be bound by any future open internet regulations as a result among other things we cannot block access to lawful internet content applications services or nonharmful devices or unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful internet network traffic although we may engage in reasonable network management 

  

 

 business data services 

in april 2016 the fcc proposed new regulations for “business data services” formerly “special access” services which provide dedicated pointtopoint transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using highcapacity connections the fcc proposed new rate regulation and other regulatory mandates that could apply to business data services offered by cable companies the proposed rules or any variation of the proposed rules if implemented could impose substantial costs on us and have other significant adverse effects on our business it is uncertain whether the fcc under the new administration will pursue this proceeding or adopt these rules 

nbcuniversal orderconsent decree conditions 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to offer all of our broadband internet access service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to maintain a broadband internet access service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to avoid discrimination in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our broadband internet access service but not including our broadband internet access service video services or voice services 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of local municipalities operate municipallyowned broadband networks certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks the fcc’s efforts to preempt such laws in tennessee and north carolina were overturned in 2016 by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit however there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create governmentowned networks and there may also be efforts in state legislatures to restrict the development of governmentowned networks or to ease or facilitate such networks in addition as part of any federal infrastructure program governmental subsidies or funding of additional internet broadband networks may be encouraged we cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business 

voice services 

we provide voice services using voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services and the fcc’s open internet regulations reclassifying internet access as a telecommunications service may further encourage statelevel regulatory actions 

voice interconnection 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services providers of voip services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec which has the right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies we have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated clecs if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic and has affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers 

  

 

 universal service 

the federal universal service program generally requires us and other phone service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers some states also have analogous programs that support service in highcost areas or to lowincome consumers the fcc has long considered implementing changes to the universal service program such as changing the fee calculation from a revenuebased formula to a peruser fee or perconnection fee adopting a fee based on bandwidth and expanding the services subject to the fee to include broadband internet access services we are unable to predict if or how the fcc may change the universal service program or the effects any such changes would have on our businesses 

the fcc recently has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing broadband deployment this shift could assist some of our competitors for example in 2014 the fcc substantially revised the program that provides universal service support for services to schools and libraries to shift support from voice services to broadband services and the deployment of wifi networks similarly the fcc has expanded its lifeline subsidy program for lowincome consumers to include broadband services in addition to voice services the fcc under the new administration or congress may revisit these subsidy programs and how they are funded we cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed 

nbcuniversal segments 

 

cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations the “program access rules” generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” 

the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with online video distributors “ovds” we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and when requested individually 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order mvpds in certain circumstances can invoke commercial arbitration for access to our cable networks and broadcast television networks including our regional sports networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide ovds in certain circumstances for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” and “internet distribution” discussions within that section 

children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age in addition the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children 

  

 

 broadcast television 

licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions substantially all of our broadcast television station licenses have pending applications for renewal although our stations’ authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is under review several of these applications have been opposed by third parties although our licenses have been renewed in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific ownership levels in local television stations and place limitations on ownership of other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast television stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc is in the process of reviewing these ownership regulations 

local television ownership 

under fcc regulations a licensee generally may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market based on audience share and there are at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations in the market without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations ownership of more than one television station within the same dma is permitted so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households the fcc also has adopted a rule that eliminates a 50 discount formerly afforded to uhf stations channels 14 and above in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap our owned broadcast television station reach does not exceed this limit but the elimination of this discount places us closer to the national cap and limits our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast television station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest 

dual network rule 

each of the four major broadcast television networks — abc cbs fox and nbc — is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current period which ends on december 31 2017 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent 

in enacting the stela reauthorization act of 2014 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast television sta 

  

 

 tions congress also is considering legislation that would modify the mustcarry and retransmission consent regime under conditions imposed in the nbcuniversal order mvpds may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations 

internet distribution 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree establish certain obligations and restraints concerning distribution of our content online we must make available certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona fide ovds in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes over access to such programming we also must distribute programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent prices terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion we are one of three broadcast network owners of hulu but we have no voting rights or board representation we have entered into renewal license agreements with hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners 

indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures in countries outside the united states a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards as well as liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietaryrights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

  

 

 while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively affect their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations while the royalties we contribute to the copyright royalty pool for broadcast signals can be challenged by copyright owners in annual audits and we cannot predict what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them in addition in response to a 2014 fcc decision eliminating the fcc’s “sports blackout” rule which previously enabled sports teams to insist that cable operators black out sports events not available on local broadcast signals the leading sports leagues petitioned the copyright royalty board to impose a copyright surcharge on cable operators to compensate sports teams for the loss of programming exclusivity and that proceeding is now pending 

there has been litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates in 2014 the us supreme court ruled that one such entity aereo violated the broadcasters’ exclusive right to perform their copyrighted works publicly subsequently aereo sought to operate as a cable system under the copyright act although the us copyright office rejected its application for a compulsory copyright license other companies continue to seek legislation or court rulings to obtain a compulsory license to stream broadcast programming online 

privacy and data security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services 

as a result of the fcc’s 2015 decision to reclassify broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to title ii of the communications act the fcc has concluded that isps are subject to fcc regulations regarding the use and disclosure of certain customer information specifically in october 2016 the fcc adopted new privacy and data security regulations governing the use of certain customer information by telecommunications carriers including isps and providers of voip services such as ours under these new regulations we may use disclose or permit access to any customer nonsensitive proprietary information subject to the customer’s ability to opt out but must obtain optin approval from the customer to use disclose or permit access to customer sensitive proprietary information with certain exceptions the new regulations also impose breach notification obligations and data security requirements these new rules are more stringent than the ftc’s privacy rules that previously applied to isps and could have adverse effects on our ability to compete in the highly concentrated online advertising market the fcc under the new administration or congress may revisit and revise these new rules although we cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed 

  

 

 in addition to fcc privacy regulations governing isps the ftc generally exercises authority over privacy protections applicable to some of our other businesses by using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers it also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or unauthorized disclosure of this type of information however a recent court decision has raised questions regarding the extent of ftc jurisdiction over companies like us whose service offerings include some common carrier services the ftc has appealed this decision we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation or the impact of the decision on our business we also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age other privacyoriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits including class actions against providers of video materials online 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts and sms messages the ftc and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information even in an aggregated noncustomeridentifiable form which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

we are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed due to a security breach and the fcc has adopted security breach rules for voice services and broadband internet access services several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information including the proper disposal of consumer information 

the national institute of standards and technology “nist” in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of us critical infrastructure including us have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized flexible repeatable performancebased and costeffective approach to cybersecurity risk it is a compendium of existing crosssector cyberdefense processes practices and protocols that can help companies identify assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities and several government agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework nist recently proposed draft updates to this voluntary framework and is collecting feedback on the draft in june 2016 the department of homeland security and the department of justice in collaboration with other federal agencies released final guidance regarding the sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures between and among federal and nonfederal entities under the cybersecurity act of 2015 finally there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure including us and the fcc is considering expanding its cybersecurity guidelines or adopting new cybersecurity requirements 

fcc spectrum auction 

congress has authorized the fcc to conduct an auction to repurpose some broadcast spectrum to mobile broadband use in this auction licensees of fullpower and class a television stations have the opportunity to sell some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for cash tv stations that do not voluntarily sell their spectrum rights may be assigned new channels on which to operate but the fcc must make “all reasonable efforts” to preserve those stations’ overtheair coverage areas and populations served and to reimburse them for reasonable relocation costs subject to an aggregate limit of 175 billion 

  

 

 nbcuniversal has submitted applications with the fcc indicating its potential interest in selling broadcast spectrum rights and we have filed an application to bid on new mobile broadband licenses filing an application in the auction does not create any obligation to sell bid on or buy spectrum 

bidding in the auction began in may 2016 and is still ongoing we cannot predict the outcome of the auction or the impact the outcome may have on our business 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are computed earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay the internet tax freedom act which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges has now been made permanent by 2016 legislation however some jurisdictions have or may assert that certain taxes akin to rightofway fees are not preempted by internet tax freedom act the fcc’s reclassification of broadband internet access services as title ii telecommunications services may cause or allow directly or indirectly some states and localities to impose various other taxes and fees on our highspeed internet business 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities 

environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs for some aspects of our businesses 

other regulations 

federal regulators actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring leased access loudness of commercial advertisements advertising emergency alert system equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions we also are subject to various international regulations including those that cover television broadcasting programming and advertising 

  

 

 employees 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 159000 fulltime and parttime employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis of these employees approximately 91000 and 58000 were associated with our cable communications business and our nbcuniversal businesses respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading “changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 

competition for our cable services consists primarily of dbs providers and phone companies with fiberbased networks that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours in 2015 att our largest phone company competitor acquired directv the nation’s largest dbs provider to create an even larger competitor that also has its own wireless phone facilities which we do not and in 2016 announced a proposed merger with time warner a media and entertainment company some of these competitors have begun offering smaller packages of channels at price points lower than our standard packages both through traditional and online distribution platforms which could cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable in addition if consolidation between wireless distributors and content providers occurs some of our competitors may offer free or lower cost streaming services for viewing their content through unlimited datausage plans for their internet or wireless phone serv 

  

 

 ices additional companies some with significant financial resources continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market primarily by offering online video programming services that can be viewed live through streaming services or by downloading 

current and future wireless internet services such as 3g 4g and 5g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as wireless data cards tablets and smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with wireless and internetbased phone services 

our cable communications business continues to seek ways to enhance the value of our cable services network such as by growing our highspeed internet and business services businesses and by launching additional services such as our home security and automation services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications segment revenue maintain our cable communications segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses 

the ability of all of our businesses to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and government authorities our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

new technologies and platforms for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these technologies and distribution platforms are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services 

while our cable communications business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and apps such as netflix on our x1 set top boxes new and traditional competitors as well as some programming networks continue to launch subscription video on demand services live online broadcast and cable television streaming services and downloading services that can be viewed on television sets computers smartphones and tablets many of these service offerings charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video services including for expanded digital video packages premium networks and our dvr and on demand services 

new technologies and distribution platforms together with an increasing number of companies offering their content directly to consumers over the internet including some that also offer exclusive highquality original 

  

 

 video programming have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers which has intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choices has and may continue to reduce the number of subscribers to our cable networks timeshifting technologies such as dvrs and cloudbased recording services and video on demand services reduce the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlets reduced viewing of our content through traditional linear television distribution outlets has caused and will likely continue to cause audience ratings declines for nbcuniversal’s linear television content and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of its content 

the success of any of these ongoing or future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital media as well as radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and audience fragmentation the growing use of new technologies or the economy in general in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which many of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content online might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue reductions in advertisers’ expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of docsis 31 x1 settop boxes wireless gateways and cloud dvr technology and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures 

  

 

 we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video highspeed internet and voice services industries our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters in recent years the fcc and certain states also have been more active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services and this trend may continue failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

changes to existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or adoption of new ones could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses in addition in recent years the fcc and certain states have been more active in considering rulemakings and legislation regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant in addition congress is expected to consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should address the fcc’s authority to implement or enforce open internet regulations and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further legislative requirements on our businesses nor can we predict how the fcc or other agencies under the new administration will address regulatory matters affecting our businesses any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communications segment’s video business 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming especially sports programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally in the past few years we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment’s results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

 

 nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets we have invested and will continue to invest substantial funds in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with multichannel video providers and if a network does not attract sufficient viewers multichannel video providers may decide not to distribute the network our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through december 31 2017 increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including subscription video on demand services and some multichannel video providers are offering smaller packages of channels as part of their streaming and linear television programming packages in addition certain online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us as a result there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce our distribution revenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

  

 

 we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events including those caused by us or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers a reduction in demand for our theme parks or damage to our equipment data properties and reputation these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we may obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business and our lines of business may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations while we develop and maintain systems and operate a comprehensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite any efforts to prevent these events and security breaches there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the 

  

 

 equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as subscription video on demand services or substitute services for our highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones smartphones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance any existing debt on acceptable terms 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and its success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights the value of our intellectual property may 

  

 

 be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation — other areas of regulation — intellectual property” discussion for additional information 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives including for example with respect to our wireless strategy in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives for example our launch of a wireless phone service in 2017 using virtual network operator rights from a third party will have successbased working capital requirements primarily associated with the procurement of handsets and other equipment as we launch the service which could have negative effects on our cash flows additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic 

  

 

 slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur our businesses may be adversely affected 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

  corporate and other 

 

 competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers 

for additional information on the competition our businesses face see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section and see item 1a risk factors and refer to the risk factors within that section entitled “our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels advertising revenue in the us is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue in the us is also cyclical with a benefit in evennumbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year our revenue and operating costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization “operating costs and expenses” are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments and the super bowl which affects our broadcast television segment our advertising revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters on standarddefinition digital video discs and bluray discs together “dvds” and through various other distribution platforms release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

  

 

 revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

 

 consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures as well as expenditures for software in our cable communications segment in recent years we continue to invest to increase our network capacity and in customer premise equipment primarily for our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology and for wireless gateways in addition because these assets generally have shorter estimated useful lives our depreciation expenses have increased and we expect this will continue in 2017 nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased due to the acquisition of the 51 interest in universal studios japan in november 2015 and our investments in new attractions in the theme parks segment 

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our 

  

 

 consolidated financial statements see note 17 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 16 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the sochi olympics in february 2014 were reported in our cable networks and broadcast television segments the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment

  customer metrics 

 

 customer metrics include residential and business customers and are presented based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

 cable communications segment – revenue 

video 

our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video service packages that may include premium networks payperview services and our on demand service our video customers may subscribe for additional fees to our highdefinition “hd” video and digital video recorder “dvr” advanced services we are actively deploying settop boxes for our internet protocol “ip” and cloudenabled video platform referred to as our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology throughout our footprint 

  

 

 video revenue increased 39 and 36 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the increases in revenue in both years were primarily due to rate adjustments and an increase in the number of residential customers subscribing to additional services such as premium channels and advanced services which accounted for increases in revenue of 39 and 45 in 2016 and 2015 respectively as of december 31 2016 148 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 139 million customers and 130 million customers as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively net additional video customers increased in 2016 primarily due to reduced customer churn which we believe is a result of our continued deployment of our x1 platform as well as improvements we have made in the customer experience the increase in revenue in 2015 was partially offset by a decrease in the number of residential video customers which was primarily due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2016 399 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 401 and 409 as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we have in the past and may in the future experience declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments 

highspeed internet 

we offer highspeed internet services with downstream speeds from a range of up to 10 mbps to fiberbased speeds up to 2 gbps we are actively deploying wireless gateways throughout our footprint which combine a customer’s wireless router cable modem and voice adapter to improve the performance of multiple ipenabled devices used at the same time within the home provide faster internet speeds and create an inhome wifi network we are continuing to expand our network of residential outdoor and business wifi hotspots to allow most of our highspeed internet customers to access our highspeed internet services inside and outside the home as of december 31 2016 there were approximately 158 million of these hotspots 

highspeed internet revenue increased 85 and 102 in 2016 and 2015 respectively increases in the number of residential customers receiving our highspeed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 58 in both 2016 and 2015 the remaining increases in revenue in both 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving higher levels of service and the impact of rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2016 438 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 419 and 402 as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively our customer base continues to grow as consumers choose our highspeed internet service and seek higherspeed offerings 

voice 

we offer voice services that provide local and longdistance calling and other related features 

voice revenue decreased 19 and 17 in 2016 and 2015 respectively while the number of residential customers receiving voice services through our discounted bundled service offerings increased in both years revenue was negatively impacted by the allocation of voice revenue for our customers who receive bundled services the amount allocated to voice revenue in the rate charged for bundled services decreased in both years because video and highspeed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat 

as of december 31 2016 207 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services compared to 206 and 205 as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

 

 business services 

we offer our cable services to small and mediumsized businesses and to large enterprises with multiple locations we offer ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to mediumsized businesses and large enterprises we also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help those customers manage network bandwidth 

business services revenue increased 161 and 200 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the number of small business customers as well as continued growth in our mediumsized business services including ethernet network and advanced voice services the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the number of small business customers receiving our highspeed internet and voice services and rate adjustments in 2016 2015 and 2014 our small business customers represented more than 70 of total business services revenue we believe the increases in the number of business customers were primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing although the rate of growth in the number of our small business customers may slow as the business matures 

advertising 

our cable communications segment also sells advertising as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell through our advertising business spotlight to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising units are sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions 

advertising revenue increased 96 in 2016 primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue advertising revenue decreased 38 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased slightly in 2016 and 30 in 2015 

in 2016 5 of our cable communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our nbcuniversal segments compared to 6 and 5 in 2015 and 2014 respectively these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

other 

other revenue primarily includes revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees we also receive revenue related to fees from other services such as our home security and automation services cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our cable franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue to which the fees apply 

other revenue increased 138 and 113 in 2016 and 2015 respectively primarily due to increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees revenue from our home security and automation services and revenue from other services 

  

 

 cable communications segment – operating costs and expenses 

programming expenses 

programming expenses which represent our most significant operating expense are the fees we incur to provide content to our video customers these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide programming expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in programming license fees including retransmission consent fees sports programming costs and fees to secure rights for additional programming for distribution across an increasing number of platforms 

we anticipate that our programming expenses will increase at a higher growth rate in 2017 as the fees we pay will increase primarily due to the timing of contract renewals and increases in retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs as we provide additional content to our video customers and as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms including on demand online and through our mobile apps we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers 

technical and product support expenses 

technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities as well as costs for network operations product development fulfillment and provisioning technical and product support expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the development delivery and support of our enhanced devices and services including our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways and continued growth in business services and home security and automation services the increases in both years were also due to expenses related to investments to improve the customer experience 

customer service expenses 

customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity customer service expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increased support for improving the customer experience and increases in total labor costs which reflect sales and support activities associated with the continued deployment of our enhanced devices and services including our x1 platform and wireless gateways and continued growth in business services and home security and automation services the rate of growth of our customer service expenses decreased in 2016 primarily due to reduced call volumes 

franchise and other regulatory fees 

franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in the revenue to which the fees apply 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new residential and business services customers and encouraging existing customers to add additional or highertier services 

other operating costs and expenses 

other operating costs and expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in costs to support our advertising sales business as well as increases in other administrative costs 

  

 

 cable communications segment – operating margin 

our cable communications segment operating margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue the most significant operating costs and expenses for our cable communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers we expect that our programming expenses will continue to increase which may negatively impact our operating margin we will attempt to mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue particularly in our highspeed internet video and business services businesses and through cost management 

our operating margin in 2016 2015 and 2014 was 402 406 and 410 respectively

advertising revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to 134 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics also higher prices for advertising units were offset by the impact of declining audience ratings advertising revenue decreased in 2015 primarily due to 80 million of revenue in 2014 associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics in addition the impact of declining audience ratings in 2015 was partially offset by higher prices for and an increase in the volume of advertising units sold as well as increased advertising revenue associated with the broadcast of nascar programming excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the 2014 sochi olympics advertising revenue decreased slightly in 2016 and increased slightly in 2015 due to the broadcast of nascar programming

theatrical revenue is generated from the worldwide theatrical release of our owned and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters and is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films 

  

 

 we distribute as well as their acceptance by audiences theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens ticket prices the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released the success of a film in movie theaters is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms 

theatrical revenue decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 primarily due to the strong performance of our larger 2015 film slate including furious 7  jurassic world and minions  the decrease in 2016 was partially offset by the strong performance of the secret life of pets and sing in 2016 

content licensing 

content licensing revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned and acquired films to cable broadcast and premium networks as well as to subscription video on demand services 

content licensing revenue increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements the increase in 2016 was partially due to the timing of when content related to our 2015 film slate was made available under licensing agreements 

home entertainment 

home entertainment revenue is generated from the sale of our owned and acquired films on dvds to retail stores rental kiosks and subscription by mail services and in digital formats home entertainment revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our releases and their acceptance by consumers release dates are determined by several factors including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases the overall dvd market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distribution services and subscription rental services all of which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales as well as due to piracy 

home entertainment revenue decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 primarily due to the strong performance of our 2015 releases including minions and jurassic world  the decrease in 2016 was partially offset by the home entertainment sales of jason bourne and the secret life of pets  

other 

we also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays from distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties from fandango our movie ticketing and entertainment business and from the sale of consumer products 

other revenue increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in revenue generated from fandango 

filmed entertainment segment – operating costs and expenses 

programming and production costs 

programming and production costs include the amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs residual and participation payments and distribution expenses residual payments represent amounts payable to certain of our employees who are represented by labor unions or guilds including freelance and temporary employees and are based on posttheatrical revenue participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent third parties that have entered into cofinancing agreements with us and other parties involved in the production of a film the costs associated with producing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future 

  

 

 programming and production costs decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 primarily due to higher amortization of film production costs in 2015 associated with our larger 2015 film slate which included furious 7  jurassic world and minions  

other operating and administrative costs and expenses 

other operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries employee benefits rent and other overhead expenses 

other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2016 primarily due to costs attributable to dreamworks animation including 61 million of severance costs other operating and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2015 due to increased expenses associated with our larger film slate 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of our films on dvds and in digital formats we incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters as a result we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits if any until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue the costs associated with marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 primarily due to higher promotional costs associated with our larger 2015 film slate the decrease in 2016 was partially offset due to advertising in 2016 for our domestic and international film slate advertising marketing and promotion expenses also increased in 2015 due to increased advertising expenses associated with fandango

investment income loss net 

the change in investment income loss net in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in income of certain investments and gains recorded on the sale of certain investments the change in investment income loss net in 2015 was primarily due to a 154 million gain related to the sale of our shares of arris group inc common stock in 2014 the components of investment income loss net are presented in a table in note 7 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

equity in net income losses of investees net 

the changes in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to an impairment charge related to goodwill recorded by the weather channel in 2015 we recorded expenses of 333 million that represented nbcuniversal’s proportionate share of the impairment charge in addition the changes in 2016 and 2015 were also due to increases in our proportionate share of losses at hulu llc which were driven by hulu’s higher programming and marketing costs in 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized our proportionate share of losses at hulu of 168 million 106 million and 20 million respectively the change in 2016 was also due to our proportionate share of losses at atairos group inc which commenced operations in 2016 

  

 

 other income expense net 

other income expense net for 2016 included 225 million recognized in connection with the settlement of amounts owed to us under an agency agreement that had provided for among other things verizon wireless’ sale of our cable services and 108 million related to the sale of our investment in the weather channel’s product and technology business to ibm

consolidated income tax expense 

 

income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions our effective income tax rate in 2016 2015 and 2014 was 370 371 and 311 respectively 

in 2014 we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions and as a result our income tax expense decreased by 759 million see note 14 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on the changes in our accruals for uncertain tax positions and related interest on these tax positions 

we expect our 2017 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35 to 37 absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions the expected annual effective tax rate includes the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation see note 3 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements if significant tax legislation is enacted in 2017 that includes a change to the federal statutory rate this could significantly impact our deferred income taxes for example using information as of december 31 2016 for each 1 change in the federal statutory rate our deferred income tax liability would change by 850 million which would primarily result in a corresponding change to income tax expense 

consolidated net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the timing of film and television production spending and related costs net of amortization including certain sports programming obligations the recognition of deferred revenue associated with the broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics an increase in certain benefit payments and the payment of a tax receivable agreement that dreamworks animation entered into with one of its former stockholders prior to our acquisition  the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to the timing of film and television production spending and related costs net of amortization the timing of payments related to our accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors and increases in deferred revenue associated with our olympics broadcasts which were partially offset by the timing of collections on our receivables 

the increases in interest payments in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding

 cable communications capital expenditures increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increased investment in line extensions and increased spending in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity as well as continued spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our x1 platform and wireless gateways 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 48 to 15 billion in 2016 and 135 to 14 billion in 2015 primarily due to continued investment in our universal theme parks including universal studios japan and a purchase of land in 2015 

our capital expenditures for 2017 are focused on continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity increased investment in line extensions primarily for the expansion of business services and the continued deployment of wireless gateways our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology in addition we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services the capacity required for existing services and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks we are developing a universal theme park in beijing china and we expect to continue to develop this park throughout 2017

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 3 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 9 and 6 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

  

 

 for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2016 we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2014 the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 26 42 and 50 respectively we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment in 2016 including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment market transactions and macroeconomic conditions weightedaverage cost of capital and an increase in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing 

we could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights in addition a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding 

  

 

 markets including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own including rights to multiyear liveevent sports programming at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear liveevent sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract 

capitalized film and television costs as well as stage play production costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of 14 million 42 million and 26 million were recorded in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program comcast’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of comcast’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2016 to 853 from 889 as of december 31 2016 nbcuniversal had no outstanding interest rate derivative financial instruments 

in 2016 2015 and 2014 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease comcast’s consolidated interest expense by 36 million 62 million and 66 million respectively the effect 

  

 

 of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on comcast’s interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2016 by contractual year of maturity the principal cash flows notional amounts fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us 

 

 we use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2016 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2016 

see note 2 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of our nonus dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations nbcuniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposure which is a result of transactions denominated in other than the functional currency nbcuniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its nonus dollar assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy nbcuniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances nbcuniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2016 and 2015 nbcuniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 15 billion and 998 million respectively as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

  

 

 we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2016 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between the functional currency and the us dollar our analysis of such a shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2016 income in addition the impact of fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar for our nonus dollar functional currency operations did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in 2016 

comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations we use crosscurrency swaps for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was a liability of 189 million and 71 million respectively

 congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video services the fcc also has launched a rulemaking to classify certain online video distributors as multichannel video providers under the fcc’s rules and thereby provide them with certain regulatory benefits under the rules see “legislation and regulation” below for additional information 

direct broadcast satellite providers 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to 335 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services directv which was 

  

 

 acquired by att in 2015 and dish network offer video services to substantially all us households dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and voice services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att and verizon have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberbased networks that provide video highspeed internet and voice services and in some cases have bundled with wireless phone services in substantial portions of our service areas these and other phone companies with fiberbased networks or digital subscriber line “dsl” technology such as centurylink also may market video services provided by dbs providers in certain areas where they provide only highspeed internet and voice services att’s acquisition of directv in 2015 created an even larger competitor to our cable services which enables them to enhance their bundled offerings 

other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided video services and have significant financial resources have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our video services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems some smatv system operators also offer bundled services to residential and business subscribers 

online video services 

our video services also compete with the services of online video distributors that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming a number of companies also have launched online video services that include both linear and ondemand programming and generally involve the offering of smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the internet at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings while some programming providers also offer programming directly to customers over the internet in most cases these services charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages consumer electronic companies that sell internetconnected tvs or gaming consoles that provide a user interface for searching television and other programming over the internet and offer links to various thirdparty internet applications may also compete with our video services the success of these services could also adversely affect demand for other video services such as our expanded digital video packages premium networks and our dvr and on demand services 

other 

our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free overtheair programming as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

   

 

   

  

  

  

 some phone companies such as att centurylink frontier and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberbased network infrastructure deeper in their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional dsl technology and are now offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas dsl technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems and certain companies that offer dsl service have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our highspeed internet services 

google which has launched a fibertothehome network that provides highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate has announced plans to expand in additional geographic areas including in some of our significant markets as google expands to more areas we expect it to become a meaningful wireline competitor to our highspeed internet and video services certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet networks and wifi networks some of these services are similar to ours these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers as well as wireless data cards a number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports also offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

voice services 

our voice services compete with wireline phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace wireline phones with mobile phones and internetbased phone services 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses 

nbcuniversal segments 

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks local broadcast television stations home entertainment payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content 

  

 

 video games and other forms of entertainment news and information our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations may compete for viewers’ attention with subscription video on demand services some of which have their own highquality original content 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and subscription video on demand services the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties for creative performing and technical personnel and for distribution of and consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for premium network and digital distribution of its films 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other providers of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities in order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure 

advertising 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as digital radio and print media the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming and from subscription video on demand services 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and refer to the “seasonality and cyclicality” discussion within that section for additional information 

  

 

 legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses our businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities in addition we must comply with the terms conditions and commitments of the fcc order that approved the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011 the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the department of justice “doj” and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years after september 2011 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones any of which may significantly affect our businesses in addition the fcc and certain states are becoming more active in considering rulemakings and legislation as well as in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant for example in february 2015 the fcc adopted new “open internet” regulations that reclassify broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” and subject it to certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act in addition in february 2015 the fcc preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks see “cable communications segment — high speed internet services” below congress also is expected to consider proposals to address communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace whether it should address the fcc’s authority to implement or enforce open internet regulations and whether it should modify rules relating to cable distribution of local broadcast television stations we are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further regulatory or legislative requirements on our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 

cable communications segment 

 

video services 

program carriage 

cable operators and other multichannel video providers are prohibited from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for a video programming network as a condition of carriage fcc regulations as well as the nbcuniversal order also prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for its carriage the fcc is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc in the past and may be subject to complaints in the future 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to this “mustcarry” requirement local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent” under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage 

  

 

 agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to review aspects of these rules for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments — broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

in 2015 the fcc revised its rate regulations to create a presumption that all local communities are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limits prices cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation that decision has been appealed in federal court the fcc accepted a certification from a massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in a number of the communities we serve in massachusetts and that will allow for continued rate regulation in those communities all of the other areas we serve except for a relatively small number where we have a petition for effective competition still pending at the fcc are covered by the fcc’s presumption and are unregulated 

cable equipment 

the communications act includes provisions aimed at promoting the retail availability of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services prior to december 2015 multichannel video providers were prohibited from deploying settop boxes that performed both channel navigation and security functions so most of our settop boxes relied on a separate security device known as a cablecard congress repealed this prohibition so we may now deploy settop boxes with integrated security congress also directed the fcc to establish a working group to report on softwarebased security aimed at promoting the retail availability of video devices in the wake of that report which was issued in august 2015 some have proposed that the fcc replace the cablecard requirements with new technology mandates on multichannel video providers to enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider’s system the chairman of the fcc proposed such a technology mandate in january 2016 and announced that the fcc plans to open a rulemaking to consider the proposal if implemented this proposal would impose substantial costs on us impair our ability to innovate and have other significant adverse effects on our business 

pole attachments 

the fcc regulates the rates terms and conditions that most poleowning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers including broadband internet access service providers such as us for allowing attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rates terms and conditions of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments in november 2015 the fcc eliminated the ability of utility companies to justify higher rates for telecommunication service pole attachments cable operators had requested this fcc action because the fcc’s new open internet regulations as described below reclassified internet access service as a telecommunications service which could have allowed for higher rental rates to be applied to a majority of our pole attachments the fcc’s order ensuring that pole rates for telecommunications service attachments approximate the cable service pole rate is expected to be challenged in court by the utility companies 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet 

  

 

 service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise 

approximately half of the states in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirements for new entrants some allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain states allow incumbent cable operators such as us to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued although even in those states incumbent cable operators may be required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services to our customers many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below including open internet regulations implemented by the fcc and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act as an internet service provider “isp” we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

open internet regulations 

in february 2015 the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under title ii of the communications act including requirements that isps’ charges and practices for and in connection with broadband internet access service be just reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory however the fcc also refrained from implementing a number of utilitystyle regulations that might otherwise apply under title ii such as rate regulation tariffs and unbundling requirements 

the new open internet regulations bar isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices prohibit isps from impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications or services or impairing or degrading the use of nonharmful devices prohibit isps from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of internet content applications or services called an “edge provider” over lawful traffic of another edge provider in exchange for consideration ie no “paid prioritization” establish a new “general conduct standard” that prohibits isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumers to select access and use the lawful internet content applications services or devices of their choosing or of edge providers to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers and require isps to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service in addition interconnection arrangements which govern how internet traffic is exchanged between highspeed internet networks and provide direct dedicated interconnection capacity to edge providers will now be subject to fcc oversight under title ii of the communications act all of these regulations are subject to fcc enforcement and could give rise to thirdparty claims for damages or equitable relief these new requirements could adversely affect our business although the extent to which they do so will depend upon the manner in which the fcc interprets and enforces them the fcc’s new open internet regulations have been appealed in federal court 

states also may attempt to use the fcc’s open internet decision to justify imposing new regulations or taxes and fees on isps that could adversely affect our business 

  

 

 separate and apart from the fcc’s new open internet regulations we committed to be bound by the fcc’s original “open internet” regulations adopted in 2010 as a condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree until 2018 although we did not agree to be bound by any future open internet regulations as a result among other things we cannot block access to lawful internet content applications services or nonharmful devices or unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful internet network traffic although we may engage in reasonable network management 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks a municipal broadband provider in tennessee and a municipality in north carolina requested that the fcc preempt state laws that restrict their ability to provide broadband internet access service and in february 2015 the fcc preempted the tennessee and north carolina laws in most respects and expressed a willingness to entertain similar preemption requests the fcc’s decision has been appealed in federal court 

definition of advanced telecommunications capability 

in january 2015 the fcc redefined what connection speeds and other service characteristics constitute “advanced telecommunications capability” increasing the downstream speed from 4 mbps to 25 mbps the definition of “advanced telecommunications capability” has been used by the fcc in the past to determine whether broadband internet access services are being deployed to all americans in a reasonable and timely manner and if they are not being so deployed the fcc may adopt new regulations that could conceivably accelerate deployment of such services the fcc relied in part on this authority to adopt its new open internet regulations 

nbcuniversal orderconsent decree conditions 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas to continue to offer all of our broadband internet access service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to maintain a broadband internet access service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to avoid discrimination in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our broadband internet access service but not including our broadband internet access service video services or voice services 

voice services 

we provide voice services using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance outage reporting rural call completion reporting universal service fund contribution obligations domestic discontinuance requirements and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether interconnected voip service should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services unless and until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip service state regulatory commissions and legislatures will continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services and the fcc’s new open internet regulations reclassifying internet access as a telecommunications service may further encourage statelevel regulatory actions 

voice interconnection 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services providers of voip services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone 

  

 

 company networks by contracting with an existing clec which has the right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies we have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated clecs if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic and has affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers in 2012 the fcc sought comment on petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for voip providers further a massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether ip interconnection agreements should be subject to regulation and other states could follow 

universal service 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers some states also have analogous programs that support service in highcost areas or to lowincome consumers the fcc has long considered implementing changes to the universal service program such as changing the fee calculation from a revenuebased formula to a peruser fee or perconnection fee adopting a fee based on bandwidth and expanding the services subject to the fee to include broadband internet access services in 2014 the fcc referred the question of how to reform universal service fees to a joint federal and state commission which was expected to make a recommendation in 2015 but has not yet done so 

the fcc recently has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing broadband deployment this shift could assist some of our competitors for example in 2014 the fcc substantially revised the program that provides universal service support for services to schools and libraries to shift support from voice services to broadband services and the deployment of wifi networks 

nbcuniversal segments 

 

cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations ie the “program access rules” generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” the fcc is considering whether certain online video distributors “ovds” should be classified as mvpds which would give them the ability to bring complaints under the program access rules 

the fcc and congress also have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with multichannel video providers and potentially with ovds we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and when requested individually 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order mvpds can invoke commercial arbitration for access in certain circumstances to our cable networks and broadcast television networks including our regional sports networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide ovds in certain circumstances for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” and “internet distribution” discussions within that section 

  

 

 children’s programming 

under federal regulations the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age in addition the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children 

broadcast television 

licensing 

local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time which may be renewed with or without conditions substantially all of our broadcast television station licenses have pending applications for renewal although our stations’ authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is under review several of these applications have been opposed by third parties and other applications are pending although our licenses have been renewed in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain them 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific ownership levels in local television stations and place limitations on ownership of other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc is reviewing the ownership regulations detailed below in 2016 

local television ownership 

under fcc regulations a licensee generally may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market based on audience share and there are at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations in the market without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations ownership of more than one television station within the same dma is permitted so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households our owned television station reach does not exceed this limit the fcc is considering eliminating a rule that currently affords uhf stations channels 14 and above a 50 discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap which if adopted would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest for many decades the fcc declined to waive the 25 indirect limit in broadcast transactions but since 2013 it has been willing to consider such waiver requests 

  

 

 dual network rule 

the four major broadcast television networks – abc cbs fox and nbc – are prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current period which ends on december 31 2017 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent 

in enacting the stela reauthorization act of 2014 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations as directed by this legislation the fcc is reviewing aspects of the requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith congress also is considering legislation that would eliminate or modify the mustcarry and retransmission consent regime under conditions imposed in the nbcuniversal order multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations 

internet distribution 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree establish certain obligations and restraints concerning distribution of our content online we must make available certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes over access to such programming we also must distribute programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent price terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion we are one of three broadcast network owners of hulu but we have no voting rights or board representation we have entered into renewal license agreements with hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners 

online video distributors 

the fcc is considering classifying certain online video distributors that offer multiple linear video programming networks to customers with a broadband internet connection as multichannel video providers under fcc rules to ensure that ovds have program access rights to video programming from vertically integrated cable programmers and the right to force local television broadcast stations to negotiate to license their content the fcc also has proposed potentially excusing these entities from all or some of the regulatory obligations applicable to current multichannel video providers if adopted these proposals would increase our program access obligations and raise complicated issues regarding the licensing of our broadcast programming 

indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures in countries outside the united states a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and 

  

 

 television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards as well as liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other proprietary rights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals pursuant to a compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations while the royalties we contribute to the copyright royalty pool for broadcast signals can be challenged by copyright owners in annual audits and we cannot predict what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

there has been litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates in 2014 the us supreme court ruled that one such entity aereo violated the broadcasters’ exclusive right to perform their copyrighted works publicly subsequently aereo sought to operate as a cable system under the copyright act although the us copyright office rejected its application for a compulsory copyright license other companies continue to seek legislation or court rulings to obtain a compulsory license to stream broadcast programming online along with other major broadcasters we also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr in addition the fcc is considering whether to classify certain ovds as multichannel video providers giving them the right to negotiate for 

  

 

 retransmission consent with local broadcast television stations and subjecting such negotiations to the goodfaith requirements under the fcc’s rules any such reclassification could influence the us copyright office to extend the compulsory license to ovds 

privacy and data security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators except for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests we are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information “cpni” related to our voice services the fcc expects broadband internet access service providers such as us to take reasonable good faith steps to comply with existing statutory requirements to protect broadband cpni and plans to propose new privacy and data security rules for broadband isps in 2016 the fcc has recently imposed substantial civil penalties and remediation obligations on several companies for alleged privacy and data security violations in 2015 comcast entered into a settlement with a california regulatory commission regarding comcast’s inadvertent disclosure of customer telephone numbers for which customers had requested nonpublished or nonlisted status 

the ftc exercises authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers it also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or unauthorized disclosure of this type of information we also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements on website operators and online services that are directed to children under 13 years of age or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age other privacyoriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits including class actions against providers of video materials online 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts or sms messages the ftc and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information even in an aggregated noncustomeridentifiable form which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

we are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed due to a security breach and the fcc has adopted security breach rules for voice services several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information including the proper disposal of consumer information 

the national institute of standards and technology in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of us critical infrastructure including us have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized flexible repeatable performancebased and costeffective approach to cybersecurity risk it is a compendium of existing crosssector cyberdefense processes practices and protocols that can help companies identify assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities and several government agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework additionally in december 2015 congress enacted the cybersecurity act of 2015 which is intended to encourage and facilitate the sharing of security threat and defensive measure information with government agencies and other companies in order to strengthen the 

  

 

 country’s overall cybersecurity protections finally there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure including us and the fcc is considering expanding its cybersecurity guidelines or adopting new cybersecurity requirements 

fcc spectrum auction 

congress has authorized the fcc to conduct an auction to repurpose some broadcast spectrum to mobile broadband use in this auction licensees of fullpower and class a television stations have the opportunity to sell some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for cash tv stations that do not voluntarily sell their spectrum rights may be assigned new channels on which to operate but the fcc must make “all reasonable efforts” to preserve those stations’ overtheair coverage areas and populations served and to reimburse them for reasonable relocation costs subject to an aggregate limit of 175 billion 

nbcuniversal has submitted applications with the fcc indicating its potential interest in selling broadcast spectrum rights potential bidders for the repurposed mobile broadband spectrum licenses must file their applications with the fcc by february 10 2016 we expect to submit an application to be a potential buyer of those new licenses bidding in the auction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016 filing an application in the auction does not create any obligation to sell bid on or buy spectrum we cannot predict whether nbcuniversal will sell any of its broadcast spectrum rights whether we will bid for or buy any of the new mobile broadband licenses or what the size of any proceeds or costs may be although any such amounts may be significant 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing through both legislative and administrative channels new or additional taxes or fees on or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by the businesses operated by the cable communications and nbcuniversal segments or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes fees incentives or credits are earned or monetized these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by the cable communications and nbcuniversal segments in some situations dbs and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay congress may not extend the internet tax freedom act which prohibits most states and localities from imposing taxes on internet access charges but expires in october 2016 additionally the fcc’s reclassification of broadband internet access services as title ii telecommunications services may cause or allow directly or indirectly some states and localities to impose additional taxes and fees on our highspeed internet business 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities as disclosed in item 3 “legal proceedings” we recently settled a matter relating to certain of our waste disposal policies procedures and practices in california 

environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations 

  

 

 other regulations 

federal regulators actively regulate other aspects of our businesses including accessibility to our cable broadcast and voice services for people with disabilities customer service standards inside wiring leased access loudness of commercial advertisements advertising emergency alert system equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions we also are subject to various international regulations including those with respect to television broadcasting programming and advertising 

employees 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 153000 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees approximately 88000 and 53000 were associated with our cable communications business and our nbcuniversal businesses respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below in “changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 

  

 

 competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of companies that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our video highspeed internet and voice services such as dbs providers and phone companies with fiberbased networks in 2015 att our largest phone company competitor acquired directv the nation’s largest dbs provider which created an even larger competitor 

wireless internet services such as 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as wireless data cards tablets and smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services continue to face increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more consumers choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services 

there also continue to be new entrants some with significant financial resources that potentially may compete with our cable services in particular google which has launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas has announced plans to expand in more areas including in some of our significant markets as google expands to more areas we expect it to become a meaningful wireline competitor to our highspeed internet and video services in addition some local municipalities are launching their own fiberbased highspeed internet services companies that provide subscription video on demand services over the internet or the ability to download video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance there can be no assurance that these or other newer entrants will not continue to launch similar services 

our cable communications business continues to seek ways enhance the value of our cable services network such as by growing our highspeed internet and business services businesses and by launching additional services such as our home security and automation services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications segment revenue maintain our cable communications segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future 

in addition some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities and may expand their service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings because we do not have our own wireless facilities our inability to provide a competitive wireless product as part of our bundled cable services offering could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and results of operations 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses 

all of our businesses’ ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and government authorities our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

alternative products and services for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these products and services are also driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services 

  

 

 while our cable communications business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology products and services have emerged that compete with our video services including those that offer subscription video on demand services or the ability to download content that can be viewed on television sets computers smartphones and tablets some of these products and services charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages for access to their content which adversely affects demand for our video services including for expanded digital video packages premium networks and our dvr and on demand services 

the increased availability of these products and services including some that also offer highquality original video programming that is exclusive to that service have contributed to an increased number of entertainment choices available to consumers which intensifies audience fragmentation additionally the increased availability of dvrs and cloudbased recording services and video on demand services reduces the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlets reduced viewing of our content through traditional linear television distribution outlets has caused and will likely continue to cause audience ratings declines for nbcuniversal’s linear television content and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of its content 

additionally several companies now offer smaller packages of channels directly to customers over the internet at price points lower than our standard packages which could adversely affect demand for our video services and reduce the subscription revenue that our cable networks or broadcast television businesses receive from multichannel video providers these smaller packages could also cause our cable communications business to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable 

the success of any of these ongoing and future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio print and increasingly digital media we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or the economy in general in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which some of our networks have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement methodologies and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example certain methods of viewing content such as delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content online might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue reductions in advertisers’ expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide 

  

 

 them with a competitive advantage for example some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of docsis 31 x1 settop boxes wireless gateways and cloud dvr technology and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video and voice services industry and more recently internet services we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases may adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

changes to existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or adoption of new ones could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses in addition the fcc and certain states are becoming more active in considering rulemakings and legislation as well as in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses some of which may be significant for example as more fully discussed in item 1 business – “legislation and regulation” in 2015 the fcc adopted new open internet regulations that reclassify broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” making it subject to certain common carriage regulations under title ii of the communications act this change could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition in 2015 the fcc adopted an order that preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii accordingly the legal and regulatory environment applicable to our businesses continues to intensify any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations 

  

 

 programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communications segment’s video business 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming especially sports programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or streaming services additionally in the past few years we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment’s results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size and the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its 

  

 

 dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through december 31 2017 increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including subscription video on demand services and some multichannel video providers are offering smaller packages of channels as part of their streaming and linear television programming packages in addition certain online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us as a result there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce our distribution revenue and the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events including those caused by us or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment data and properties these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future and any such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition we may obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business and our lines of business may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced a few minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations while we develop and maintain systems and operate a comprehensive security program seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite any efforts to prevent these events and security breaches 

  

 

 there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as subscription video on demand services or substitute services for our highspeed internet and voice services such as mobile phones smartphones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks business weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing including refinancing any existing debt on acceptable terms 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and its success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction dis 

  

 

 tribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights for example nbcuniversal has brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr additionally legislation has been proposed in the us congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislation would ultimately affect our businesses 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation — other areas of regulation — intellectual property” discussion for additional information 

acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives including for example with respect to a wireless strategy in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent and cable communications’ employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

  

 

 the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur our businesses may be adversely affected 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

 competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers 

for additional information on the competition our businesses face see item 1a risk factors and refer to the risk factors entitled “our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” within that section 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels our us advertising revenue is generally higher 

  

 

 in the second and fourth quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical with a benefit in evennumbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year our revenue and operating costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization “operating costs and expenses” are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments and the super bowl which affect our broadcast television segment our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters on dvd and through digital distribution services release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods

operating costs and expenses for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “segment operating results” operating costs and expenses for our other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “corporate and other results of operations” 

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

 

 consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses increased in 2015 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures as well as expenditures for software in our cable communications segment in recent years we continue to invest in customer premise equipment primarily for our x1 platform wireless gateways and cloud dvr technology and in equipment to increase our network capacity in addition because these assets generally have shorter estimated useful lives our depreciation expenses have increased which we expect will 

  

 

 continue in 2016 in 2015 depreciation and amortization expenses included 20 million related to the acceleration of amortization for certain intangible assets and the writeoff of certain capitalized costs associated with the termination of the time warner cable merger and related divestiture transactions consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses increased slightly in 2014 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments as well as increases related to our acquisitions in 2013 of our corporate headquarters and real estate properties for nbcuniversal 

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 18 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 17 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics were reported in our cable networks and broadcast television segments

  customer metrics 

 

 customer metrics include residential and business customers and are presented based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

 cable communications segment – revenue 

video 

video revenue increased 36 and 12 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the increases in revenue in both years were due to increases in the number of residential customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments partially offset by decreases in the number of residential video customers the increases in residential customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments accounted for increases in revenue of 45 and 27 in 2015 and 2014 respectively as of december 31 2015 139 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 130 million customers and 125 million customers as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

 

 respectively the decreases in the number of residential video customers in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2015 401 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 409 and 419 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers 

highspeed internet 

highspeed internet revenue increased 102 and 95 in 2015 and 2014 respectively increases in the number of residential customers receiving our highspeed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 58 and 59 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the remaining increases in revenue in both 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving higher levels of service and rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2015 419 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 402 and 384 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively our customer base continues to grow as consumers choose our highspeed internet service and seek higherspeed offerings 

voice 

voice revenue decreased 17 in 2015 and increased slightly in 2014 while the number of residential customers receiving voice services through our discounted bundled service offerings increased in both years revenue was negatively impacted by the allocation of voice revenue for our customers who receive bundled services the amount allocated to voice revenue in the rate charged for bundled services decreased in 2015 and 2014 because video and highspeed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat 

as of december 31 2015 206 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services compared to 205 and 199 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

business services 

business services revenue increased 200 and 219 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the increases in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases in the number of small business customers receiving our highspeed internet and voice services and rate adjustments in 2015 2014 and 2013 our small business customers represented more than 70 of total business services revenue the remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in our mediumsized business services including ethernet network and advanced voice services 

we believe the increases in the number of business customers were primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing 

advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our spotlight business sells to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising units are sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions 

advertising revenue decreased 31 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased 37 in 2015 advertising 

  

 

 revenue increased 115 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in political revenue of 80 as well as an increase in revenue in our national and local advertising markets excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased 35 in 2014 

in 2015 7 of our cable communications segment’s advertising revenue was generated from our nbcuniversal segments compared to 5 and 4 in 2014 and 2013 respectively these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

other

we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content to our video customers as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms including on demand online and through our mobile apps and as the fees we pay increase primarily sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 3 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 9 and 6 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

  

 

 for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights we considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment market transactions and macroeconomic conditions and also the 8 increase in our market capitalization since we performed our 2014 quantitative assessment in addition we considered the results of our 2014 quantitative assessment in which the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 26 42 and 50 respectively we also compared our weightedaverage cost of capital in 2015 to that used in our 2014 quantitative assessment and it had remained relatively consistent based on our 2015 qualitative assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise rights were higher than our carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical 

  

 

 performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including home entertainment and other distribution platforms are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own including rights to multiyear liveevent sports programming at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is available for use we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast we amortize multiyear liveevent sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract 

capitalized film and television costs as well as stage play production costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of 42 million 26 million and 167 million were recorded in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program comcast’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of comcast’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2015 to 845 from 892 nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of nbcuniversal’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2015 to 715 from 739 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease comcast’s consolidated interest expense by 62 million 66 million and 98 million respectively the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on comcast’s interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2015 the principal cash flows notional amounts fair values and contract terms of financial instruments by contractual year of maturity subject to interest rate risk maintained by us 

 

 the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps in the table above includes 3 million associated with interest rate swaps held by nbcuniversal 

we use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the 

  

 

 relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2015 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2015 

see note 2 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar value of our nonus dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations nbcuniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposure resulting from transactions denominated in other than the functional currency nbcuniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy nbcuniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances nbcuniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2015 and 2014 nbcuniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 998 million and 890 million respectively as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2015 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between the functional currency and the us dollar our analysis of such a shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2015 income in addition the impact of fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar for our nonus dollar functional currency operations did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in 2015 

comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations we use crosscurrency swaps for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in other than the functional currency crosscurrency swaps effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was a liability of 71 million and an asset of 37 million respectively 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

comcast and nbcuniversal manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties we do not expect such 

  

 

 losses if any to be significant comcast has agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty’s credit ratings as of december 31 2015 and 2014 comcast was not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements as of december 31 2015 we did not hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements

to offer our video services we license a substantial portion of our programming from cable networks and broadcast networks as well as from local broadcast television stations we attempt to secure longterm programming distribution agreements with our content providers we also license individual programs or packages of programs from programming suppliers for our on demand and streaming services we seek to include in our distribution agreements the right to offer such programming to our subscribers through multiple delivery platforms that may be used in a variety of locations such as through on demand our xfinity online portal and our mobile apps 

our video programming expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks the fees we pay for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content to our customers as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms including on demand online and our mobile apps and as the fees we pay increase primarily from retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us attract and retain video customers

competition 

 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information products and services to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior 

cable communications 

competition for our video services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete in all of our service areas and phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 55 of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks our highspeed internet services primarily compete with phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 60 of our service areas and also are continuing to expand their 

  

 

 fiberbased networks many of these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for these services individually and in bundles comparable to the pricing and services we offer there also continue to be new companies some with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with some or all of our cable services for example companies continue to emerge that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee and google is providing highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and recently announced plans to expand into additional geographical areas moreover wireless technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our video and highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace landline phones with mobile phones and internetbased phone services such as skype 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

 we also may compete with digital distributors that offer online services and devices that enable internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming 

congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video services the fcc also has launched a rulemaking to classify certain online video distributors as multichannel video distributors under the fcc’s rules and thereby provide them with certain regulatory benefits under the rules see “legislation and regulation” below for additional information 

direct broadcast satellite providers 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to 34 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services two companies directv and dish network provide video service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att and verizon have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberbased networks that provide video highspeed internet and voice services in substantial portions of our service areas these and other phone companies with fiberbased networks or digital subscriber line technology “dsl” such as centurylink also may market video services provided by dbs providers in certain areas 

  

 

 where they provide only highspeed internet and phone services in may 2014 att our largest phone company competitor announced its intention to acquire directv the nation’s largest dbs provider if completed this transaction will create an even larger competitor for our cable services that will have the ability to expand its cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings 

other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided video services and have significant financial resources have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our video services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and business subscribers 

online video services 

we may also compete with online services from digital distributors that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming and in some cases charge a nominal or no fee a number of companies also have announced plans to launch online video services that will reportedly include both linear and ondemand programming and one traditional provider of cable services has begun to offer smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the internet at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings some content providers also are beginning to offer programming directly to customers over the internet for a nominal fee additionally we may compete with consumer electronic companies that sell internetconnected tvs or gaming consoles that provide a user interface for searching television and other programming and offer links to various thirdparty apps the success of these newer services could negatively impact demand for our video services including for our dvr premium network and on demand services 

other 

our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free overtheair programming as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 

 dsl technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att centurylink and frontier have built and are continuing to build out fiber deeper in their networks which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional dsl technology and are now offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas verizon on the other hand has built out and continues to build out a fibertothehome network in many of our services areas while google has launched a similar fibertothehome network and is providing highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and recently announced plans to expand in additional geographical areas certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiberbased networks 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet networks and wifi networks some of these services are similar to ours these networks work with devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers as well as wireless data cards in addition a number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

voice services 

our voice services compete with wireline phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other internetbased and voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with wireless phone service providers as customers replace landline phones with mobile phones and internetbased phone services 

business services 

our business services primarily compete for business services customers with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling all or part of another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who provide video offerings for businesses 

nbcuniversal segments 

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks local broadcast television stations home entertainment payperview and video on demand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content video games and other forms of entertainment news and information our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations may compete for viewers’ attention with subscription video on demand services some of which have their own highquality original content 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and subscription video on demand services the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

  

 

 our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties creative performing and technical personnel and with distributors for their content and for consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds and for digital distribution of its products 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities in order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure the investment required to introduce new attractions in our theme parks can be significant 

advertising 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as online radio and print media additionally the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of technologies such as dvrs and video on demand services which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming and from subscription video on demand services 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and refer to the “seasonality and cyclicality” discussion for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses which are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into 

  

 

 with franchising authorities in addition our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the department of justice “doj” and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years after september 2011 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses for example in february 2015 the fcc adopted new open internet regulations that reclassify broadband internet service as a “telecommunications service” making it subject to common carriage regulations under title ii of the communications act in addition in february 2015 the fcc adopted an order that preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks see “cable communications segment – high speed internet services” below congress also is expected to consider a number of legislative proposals addressing communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace how it should address the fcc’s authority to implement open internet regulations and whether it should modify rules relating to cable distribution of local broadcast television stations we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law or how any such changes would ultimately affect our businesses we are also seeking regulatory approvals from federal state and local authorities relating to our acquisition of cable systems from time warner cable and charter and cannot predict what conditions might be applied to any such approvals or how such conditions might affect our businesses 

the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 

cable communications segment 

 

video services 

program carriage 

the communications act and fcc regulations prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video providers from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us in addition the nbcuniversal order prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage and requires that if we place news andor business news channels in a channel lineup “neighborhood” we must place all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood in early 2014 we settled a complaint filed by bloomberg television at the fcc involving this condition we have been involved in other program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future adverse decisions in disputes under the program carriage regulations or nbcuniversal order conditions could negatively affect our business 

  

 

 mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations as an alternative to must carry local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator such agreements frequently involve payments to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations congress passed legislation in 2014 which among other things directs the fcc to initiate a rulemaking to review aspects of its retransmission consent rules we cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking or how it might affect our future retransmission consent negotiations for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments — broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates approximately 80 of our video services customers are not subject to rate regulation from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations 

cable equipment 

the communications act includes provisions aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services and the fcc has adopted regulations implementing this policy with the exception of certain oneway devices like digital transport adapters these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result most settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard congress passed legislation in 2014 that repeals this prohibition in december 2015 the legislation also directs the fcc to establish a working group to report by september 2015 on softwarebased security aimed at promoting the retail availability of video devices it is uncertain what if any steps the fcc will take in response to that report 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates terms and conditions that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems and telecommunications carriers for allowing attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rates terms and conditions of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards until recently the pole attachment rates applicable to telecommunications services were significantly higher than the rates we have paid for cable and other services in 2013 a federal court upheld changes to the fcc’s pole rate formula that reduce the rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels that are at or near the rates for cable attachments however utility companies are able to rebut certain presumptions in the new fcc formula so as to justify higher rates and it is expected that most will attempt to do so 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to juris 

  

 

 diction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access “peg” programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise 

approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states the incumbent cable operators sometimes are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable distribution system our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers “isps” implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity and the fcc is considering new requirements for isps 

open internet regulations 

in february 2015 the fcc adopted new open internet regulations but the text of the order has not been released yet the fcc announced that the order reclassifies broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” making it subject to common carrier regulation under title ii of the communications act the fcc however has indicated that the order will forbear from a number of utilitystyle regulations such as rate regulation tariffs and unbundling requirements the fcc also announced that the order adopts rules that bar isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices prohibits isps from impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content applications services or impairing or degrading the use of nonharmful devices prohibits isps from favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration ie no paid prioritization prohibits isps from prioritizing internet content and services of their affiliates establishes a new general conduct standard that prohibits isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumers to select access and use the lawful content applications services or devices of their choosing or of edge providers to make lawful content applications services or devices available to consumers and expands the fcc’s current internet transparency rules in addition the fcc explained that the agency has now asserted jurisdiction for the first time over internet traffic exchange so interconnection arrangements will now be subject to a statutory requirement that all charges practices classifications and regulations for and in connection with interconnection must be just and reasonable all of these requirements will be subject to fcc enforcement and potential thirdparty claims for damages or equitable relief 

until the order is released we are unable to determine what specific requirements will apply to our business or how they will apply to our business nor can we predict what the impact of such requirements would be on our business 

  

 

 states also may attempt to use the fcc’s decision to classify isps as title ii “telecommunications carriers” and the court’s decision to impose regulations on isps or otherwise affect the development of the broadband internet marketplace in ways that could affect our business 

separate and apart from the new rules comcast is currently bound by the fcc’s original “open internet” regulations adopted in 2010 as a condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree for the remainder of the term of those orders these regulations require that we disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service the “transparency rule” bar us from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and bar us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the noblocking and nondiscrimination requirements allow for reasonable network management the fcc did not prohibit use of speed tiers or usagebased pricing but specifically noted that “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing of its own internet content likely would violate these regulations these requirements apply to any broadband internet access service that we provide to consumers regardless of whether it is accessed through a settop box gaming console computer or other device the fcc’s original 2010 rules except for the transparency rule were vacated by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in january 2014 

municipally owned broadband networks 

a number of states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks a municipal broadband provider in tennessee and a municipality in north carolina filed petitions with the fcc requesting that the fcc preempt state laws that restricted their ability to provide broadband service the fcc adopted an order in february 2015 that preempts the tennessee and north carolina laws in most respects and expresses a willingness to entertain similar preemption requests until the order is released we cannot predict what effects the order will have on our business 

definition of advanced telecommunications capability 

in january 2015 the fcc redefined what connection speeds and other service characteristics constitute “advanced telecommunications capability” increasing the downstream speed from 4 mbps to 25 mbps the definition of “advanced telecommunications capability” has been used by the fcc in the past to determine whether broadband internet services are being deployed to all americans in a reasonable and timely way under the relevant statute because the fcc has determined that “advanced telecommunications capability” is not being deployed in a reasonable and timely manner it has regulatory authority to adopt new regulations that might conceivably accelerate deployment of such services the fcc reportedly is considering relying in part on this authority to adopt new open internet regulations the fcc also could use this authority to adopt other measures affecting our broadband business 

nbcuniversal order conditions 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas to continue to offer all of our highspeed internet service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to maintain a highspeed internet service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to not discriminate in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our highspeed internet service but not including our highspeed internet service video services or voice services we have taken a number of steps to comply with these conditions in 2012 after an fcc inquiry into whether we failed to comply with the standalone broadband condition we entered into a consent decree with the fcc to extend our offering of the performance starter tier for one additional year until february 2015 and to reinforce the promotion of our standalone broadband offerings including training our sales representatives with respect to these offerings 

  

 

 other regulatory activities 

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email for example in 1998 the internet tax freedom act was enacted in an effort to promote use of the internet and it has been extended several times but is scheduled to expire in september 2015 unless it is extended again state and local governments also have adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service expanded copyright protection requirements taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed isps it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

voice services 

we provide voice services by using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance calea outage reporting rural call completion reporting universal service fund contribution obligations domestic discontinuance requirements and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether interconnected voip service should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are still regulated more pervasively than information services the regulatory environment for our voice services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip service state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services a number of states have enacted laws that preclude state public utility regulation of voipbased services notwithstanding how they are classified under federal law

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services the precise scope of interconnection regulations applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear in light of this uncertainty providers of voip services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our affiliated clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in all of these challenges and no such challenges are currently pending however if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted in 2012 the fcc sought comment on two petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for ip voice providers and it also formed a task force to coordinate the fcc’s efforts on issues related to the transition of networks from circuitswitched to packetswitched technology including the issue of ip interconnection we cannot predict what if any further actions the fcc might take in this area or what effect any such actions might have on our business further a massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether ip interconnection agreements should be subject to regulation and other states could follow in 2011 the fcc issued an order clarifying the entire intercarrier compensation system which governs the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic whether it be for local intrastate or interstate traffic over the traditional phone network or from voip providers to the traditional phone network the fcc order affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers the fcc order was upheld on appeal by a federal court but that decision has now been appealed to the supreme court of the united states 

  

 

 universal service 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers some states also have analogous programs that support service in highcost areas or to lowincome consumers 

the fcc issued an order in 2011 that changed the way that a majority of universal service funds are allocated and began implementing that order in 2012 by focusing on broadband and wireless deployment and moving away from supporting traditional telephone service the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings while others could receive less funding the actual impact of the changes is not yet known the fcc’s ruling has been upheld by a federal court but that decision has now been appealed to the supreme court of the united states 

in july 2014 the fcc released an order substantially revising the program to support services to schools and libraries under the new rules support will be shifted from voice services and other legacy services to broadband service and to the deployment of wifi networks in december 2014 the fcc adopted an order increasing the budget for and making additional changes to the schools and libraries program we cannot predict how these changes will affect our businesses 

the fcc has a longpending proceeding to reform the mechanism used to collect the fees used to fund federal universal service programs proposals in that proceeding have included changing the basis on which the fee is calculated from revenue to a peruser fee or perconnection fee adopting a fee based on bandwidth or expanding the services subject to the fee to include broadband internet access in august 2014 the fcc referred the question of how to reform universal service fees to the federalstate joint board on universal service which is expected to make a recommendation in april 2015 in announcing certain aspects of his proposed open internet order the fcc chairman stated that his proposed order would not impose universal service fees on broadband internet access services we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings and whether they will affect our business 

other regulations 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and voice services cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay congress may not extend the internet tax freedom act which prohibits most states and localities from imposing taxes on internet access charges additionally the fcc may impose title ii regulation on internet access service which may cause directly or indirectly some states and localities to impose additional taxes and fees on our highspeed internet business 

  

 

 nbcuniversal segments 

 

cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in 2012 the fcc relaxed its restriction on exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated networks such agreements can now be reviewed on a casebycase basis in response to a complaint the fcc is considering proposals that would make it easier for mvpds to succeed with complaints involving exclusive contracts and making it easier for them to use buying groups to purchase programming the fcc also recently initiated a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether certain online video distributors “ovds” should be classified as mvpds and be given the ability to bring complaints under the program access rules it is uncertain whether the fcc will act on these proposals and if adopted what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks 

in recent years both the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available to mvpds on a standalone or “unbundled” basis when negotiating distribution agreements lawmakers also have proposed legislation that would provide certain program access rights and protections to online video distributors we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled and when requested on a standalone basis it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will ever be adopted and if so what impact they would have on our cable networks 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order mvpds can invoke commercial arbitration for program access in certain circumstances against our cable networks and broadcast television networks including our regional sports networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” and “internet distribution” discussions within that section 

children’s programming 

the children’s television act “cta” and fcc regulations limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age and require that television stations’ programming serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age in addition the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children 

broadcast television 

licensing 

the communications act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time and upon application may renew the licenses for additional terms 

renewal applications are pending for a number of our broadcast television station licenses the fcc may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum eight years otherwise permitted a station’s authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review six pending applications have been opposed by third parties 

  

 

 and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations’ programming although we have received such renewals in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain them 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific levels in local television stations as well as other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc by law must review the ownership regulations detailed below once every four years the review initiated in 2010 was not completed instead it has been incorporated into the quadrennial review initiated in 2014 the fcc expects to complete the review in 2016 there are also several pending court challenges to the ownership regulations we cannot predict when the fcc’s current review will be completed or whether or how any of these regulations will change 

local television ownership 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the fcc and at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition further without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same dma so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally under the rule no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households our owned television station reach does not exceed this limit in 2013 the fcc launched a rulemaking that considers eliminating a rule that currently affords uhf stations channels 14 and above a 50 discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap adoption of this proposed change would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership ie through one or more subsidiaries although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest for many decades the fcc has declined to waive the 25 indirect limit in broadcast transactions but in a 2013 declaratory ruling the fcc stated that it is now willing to consider such waiver requests 

dual network rule 

the dual network rule prohibits any of the four major broadcast television networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers for the current period which ends on december 31 2017 all of our owned nbc broadcast television stations and our owned telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent 

  

 

 in enacting the stela reauthorization act of 2014 “stelar” congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations stelar also directs the fcc to conduct a rulemaking in 2015 to review aspects of the requirement that commercial television stations and mvpds negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith the fcc also has pending a rulemaking to consider among other issues modifications to the goodfaith negotiating standards and possible elimination of rules protecting local television stations’ exclusive rights to transmit network and syndicated programming in their local markets congress also is considering legislation that would eliminate or modify the mustcarry and retransmission consent regime we cannot predict what new laws or regulations if any may be adopted or how any such laws or regulations would affect our businesses under conditions imposed in the nbcuniversal order mvpds may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations 

internet distribution 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree establish certain obligations and restraints concerning distribution of our content online we must make available certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes over access to such programming we also must distribute programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent price terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion we are one of three broadcast network owners of hulu but we have no voting rights or board representation we have entered into renewal license agreements with hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners 

broadcast spectrum 

in 2012 congress authorized the fcc to conduct an incentive auction to reassign a portion of the broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use under the statute broadcasters may voluntarily relinquish some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the fcc’s auction of the spectrum broadcasters that do not voluntarily relinquish their spectrum rights may still be affected as part of the process of clearing and repacking the spectrum but congress required the fcc to make “all reasonable efforts” to preserve broadcasters’ overtheair coverage areas and populations served and to reimburse those broadcasters’ reasonable relocation costs the fcc currently is conducting a proceeding to implement this statute addressing matters such as incentive auction procedures pricing methodologies spectrum repacking and broadcaster relocation cost reimbursement current fcc plans are to conduct the incentive auction in 2016 we cannot predict whether or how the incentive auction might affect our businesses 

indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm 

indecency regulation has been the subject of recent court review regarding both the fcc’s “fleeting expletives” policy and the fcc’s definition of what constitutes indecent material a us supreme court decision in 2012 may result in the fcc’s clarification of its policy and changes to how it approaches future indecencyrelated enforcement actions in this regard in 2013 the fcc sought public comment regarding its indecency enforcement policies but it has taken no further action from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local television stations included indecent or profane material 

  

 

 international regulation 

international regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes the regulation of programming and advertising for example the european union “eu” establishes minimum levels of regulation across all eu member states focused on content and advertising which also extends to nonlinear television services although eu countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas 

online video distributors 

the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider classifying certain ovds that offer multiple linear programming networks to customers with a broadband internet connection as mvpds under fcc rules the fcc’s proposal is designed to ensure that these ovds have program access rights to programming from vertically integrated cable programmers and the right to force broadcast stations to negotiate to license their content the fcc also has proposed potentially excusing these entities from all or some of the regulatory obligations applicable to current mvpds if adopted these proposals would increase our program access obligations and raise complicated issues regarding the licensing of our broadcast programming the outcome of this proceeding cannot be determined at this time 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures under various consent judgments federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the united states in countries outside the united states there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and internetdomain laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or 

  

 

 enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations and we cannot predict what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

there has been litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates in 2014 the us supreme court ruled that one such entity aereo violated the broadcasters’ exclusive right to perform their copyrighted works publicly subsequently aereo sought to operate as a cable system under the copyright act although the us copyright office rejected its application for a compulsory copyright license we also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr additionally legislation has been proposed in the us congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislation would ultimately affect our businesses in addition the fcc recently sought comment on whether classifying certain ovds as mvpds would give such ovds the right to negotiate for retransmission consent with local broadcast stations and subject such negotiations to the goodfaith requirements under the fcc’s rules we cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking or how it would affect our businesses 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the communications act and fcc regulations also provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services several states and numerous local jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws or franchise privacy provisions that apply to cable services 

the ftc has continued to exercise authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers it also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or unauthorized disclosure of this type of information in 2013 ftc regulations implementing the children’s online privacy protection act “coppa” went into effect coppa imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are directed to children under 13 years of age or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age the ftc rules impose some significant new obligations on operators of websites and online services including expanded categories of personal information and new data security and data retention requirements and also expand the scope of coppa to reach thirdparty service providers that knowingly collect personal information through a website or service focused towards children 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts or sms messages the ftc and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information even in an 

  

 

 aggregated noncustomeridentifiable form these requirements may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

we are also subject to state and federal regulations and laws regarding information security most of these regulations and laws apply to consumer information that could be used to commit identity theft substantially all of the us states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed because of a security breach the fcc has adopted security breach rules for voice services in october 2014 the fcc proposed to impose fines totaling 10 million on two companies for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third parties several states have also enacted general information security requirements to safeguard consumer information including the proper disposal of consumer information in addition we maintain an identity theft program that incorporates the guidance provided under the ftc’s “red flag rules” which are designed to detect the warning signs of identity theft 

in 2013 the president directed the national institute of standards and technology “nist” in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of us critical infrastructure including us to develop a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized flexible repeatable performancebased and costeffective approach to cyber risk which was released in february 2014 it is a compendium of existing crosssector cyberdefense processes practices and protocols that can help companies identify assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities additionally there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure including us several government agencies have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework the fcc is considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately be adopted or how such requirements if any would affect our businesses 

additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

advertising restrictions 

legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children and on the tax deductibility of advertising expenses we are unable to predict whether such reports would result in legislative proposals whether legislative proposals may be adopted or if adopted what impact they would have on our businesses 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities we have been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of nbcuniversal’s current and former facilities and at offsite waste disposal locations although our share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material in addition the california attorney general and the alameda county california district attorney are investigating whether certain of our waste disposal policies procedures and practices are in violation of the california business and professions code and the california health and safety code see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

  

 

 environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations we are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses 

disabilities access 

our businesses are subject to a number of statutory and regulatory requirements related to ensuring that our services are accessible to individuals with disabilities among other things our voice services and email services must be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities we must provide additional narrations of key visual elements on certain of our video services and programming and we must include closed captioning on certain video programming delivered to our customers the fcc has adopted quality standards for closed captioning as well as rules that will require that onscreen menus and program guides used on settop boxes and other navigation devices to access multichannel video programming be audibly accessible to blind and lowvision customers the fcc is considering further accessibility requirements for mvpds and we cannot predict what impact those further requirements would have on our businesses 

other fcc regulations 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our businesses including the mandatory blackout of syndicated and network programming customer service standards inside wiring leased access loudness of commercial advertisements political advertising emergency alert system requirements equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of cable systems and television stations and regulatory fees the fcc is considering possible changes to regulations in several other areas we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc regulations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 139000 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees approximately 84000 and 43000 were associated with our cable communications business and our nbcuniversal businesses respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

  

 

 additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below in “changes in consumer behavior driven by newer products and services may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models” 

cable communications 

competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of companies that typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services such as 

 

  

  

 some of our phone company competitors also have their own wireless facilities and may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings which may have an adverse impact on our competitive position business and results of operations in may 2014 att our largest phone company competitor announced its intention to acquire directv the nation’s largest dbs provider if completed this transaction will create an even larger competitor for our cable services 

there continue to be new entrants some with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services these newer entrants some of which charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content include companies that provide subscription video on demand services over the internet or the ability to download video programming additionally google has launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas and some local municipalities are launching their own fiberbased highspeed internet services there can be no assurance that these newer entrants will not continue to launch services in more of our services areas 

our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network such as by expanding and enhancing our business services to mediumsized businesses and by launching additional services such as our home security and automation services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future 

  

 

 nbcuniversal 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses for example 

 

  

  

  

 all of our businesses’ ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and governmental authorities in addition our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our cable services customers with a satisfactory customer experience there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

changes in consumer behavior driven by newer products and services may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 

newer products and services particularly alternative methods for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models these products and services are also driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services 

while our cable communications business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors for example by deploying our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology products and services have emerged that may compete with our video services including services and devices that offer subscription video on demand services or the ability to download movies television shows and other video programming any of which can be viewed on television sets computers smartphones and tablets some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content which could adversely affect demand for our video services including for expanded digital video packages premium networks and our dvr and on demand services additionally one traditional provider of cable services has begun and other companies have indicated they also may begin to offer smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the internet at price points lower than our traditional video service package offerings which could adversely affect demand for our video services or cause us to offer more customized programming packages that may be less profitable 

  

 

 newer services in wireless internet technology such as 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as wireless data cards tablets and smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services continue to face increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more consumers choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services 

newer products and services are also driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communications services for example the increased availability of dvrs video on demand services and cable broadcast and other video programming on the internet including highquality original video programming that may be viewed only through subscription video on demand services as well as increased access to media through wireless devices have the potential to reduce the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlets some content providers are also beginning to offer programming directly to consumers over the internet for a nominal fee reduced viewing of content through traditional distribution outlets could adversely affect demand for our cable communications’ video services the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to nbcuniversal for content and the levels of dvd and theatrical sales these newer products and services have contributed to an increased number of entertainment choices available to consumers which have caused and may continue to cause audience ratings pressure for our content and intensify the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 

the success of any of these ongoing and future developments or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior including among younger consumers could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and results of operations 

a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio print and increasingly online media we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and a decline in expenditures by advertisers including through traditional linear television distribution models could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or by the economy in general in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which some of our cable networks have experienced and may continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement methodologies and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels for example newer methods of viewing content such as delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content online might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue reductions in advertisers’ expenditures could adversely affect our revenue and businesses 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiberbased networks that provide very fast internet access speeds and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive 

  

 

 to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected moreover we may incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of our x1 settop boxes wireless gateways and cloud dvr technology and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases may adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal laws and regulations our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters we are also seeking regulatory approvals from federal state and local authorities relating to our acquisition of cable systems from time warner cable and charter and cannot predict what conditions might be applied to any such approvals or how such conditions might affect our businesses failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation” discussion within that section 

changes to existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or adoption of new ones could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses for example as more fully discussed in item 1 business – “legislation and regulation” in february 2015 the fcc adopted new open internet regulations that reclassify broadband internet service as a “telecommunications service” making it subject to common carriage regulations under title ii of the communications act which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition in february 2015 the fcc adopted an order that preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii any changes to the regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations 

  

 

 programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communications segment’s businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has experienced continued increases in the cost of programming especially sports programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms such as on demand or mobile apps additionally in the past few years we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations these market factors may be exacerbated by the increasing trend of consolidation in the media industry which may further increase our programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our cable communications segment’s results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs moreover particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size and the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network 

  

 

 affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor in the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through december 31 2017 our ability to continue to receive compensation from distributors as part of our retransmission consent negotiations may be adversely impacted by online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms including subscription video on demand services there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events including those caused by us or by third parties such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties equipment and data these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future 

in addition we may obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customers personnel and vendors and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many lines of business and our lines of business may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring due to the nature of our businesses and the fact that we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form stored on cloud servers in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced a few minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development and main 

  

 

 tenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite any efforts to prevent these events and security breaches there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as subscription video on demand services or substitute services for our highspeed internet and phone services such as mobile phones smartphones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue the performance of our films and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending in our theme parks business weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us and any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and its success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction dis 

  

 

 tribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights for example nbcuniversal has brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr additionally legislation has been proposed in the us congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislation would ultimately affect our businesses 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see item 1 business and refer to the “legislation and regulation — other areas of regulation — intellectual property” discussion for additional information 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions including our planned transactions with time warner cable and charter in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions such as the time warner cable or charter transactions additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent and cable communications’ employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils most of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

  

 

 in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if any of these events occur our businesses may be adversely affected 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

on february 12 2014 we entered into the merger agreement with time warner cable time warner cable is among the largest providers of video highspeed internet and voice services in the united states located mainly in five geographic areas new york state including new york city the carolinas the midwest including ohio kentucky and wisconsin southern california including los angeles and texas as of december 31 2014 time warner cable had 110 million video customers 123 million highspeed internet customers and 56 million voice customers as a result of the time warner cable merger time warner cable stockholders will receive in exchange for each share of time warner cable common stock owned immediately prior to the time warner cable merger 2875 shares of our class a common stock we estimate that at the time of closing time warner cable stockholders will own approximately 24 of the outstanding shares of our common stock because the exchange ratio was fixed at the time of the merger agreement and the market value of our class a common stock will continue to fluctuate the number of shares of class a common stock to be issued and the total value of the consideration exchanged will not be determinable until 

  

 

 the closing date the time warner cable merger was approved by both comcast shareholders and time warner cable stockholders in october 2014 the time warner cable merger remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions and is expected to close in early 2015 

divestiture transactions 

the terms of the merger agreement contemplated that we would divest systems serving up to approximately 3 million of our video customers following the time warner cable merger in order to obtain applicable regulatory approvals as a result of this commitment on april 25 2014 we entered into an agreement with charter that if consummated would satisfy the divestiture undertaking under this agreement following the close of the time warner cable merger and subject to various conditions we agreed to divest cable systems which would result in a net disposition of approximately 37 million video customers through three transactions 1 a spinoff of certain of our existing cable systems serving approximately 25 million of our video customers the “spinoff transaction” into a newly formed public entity “spinco” 2 an exchange of certain former time warner cable cable systems serving approximately 15 million video customers for charter cable systems serving approximately 16 million video customers and 3 a sale to charter of certain former time warner cable cable systems serving approximately 14 million video customers for cash collectively the “divestiture transactions” 

in connection with and prior to the spinoff transaction it is expected that spinco would incur new debt the debt would consist of credit facilities to fund cash distributions to us and notes which spinco would issue to us these notes would enable us to complete a debtfordebt exchange where financial institutions would exchange a portion of our debt securities for the new spinco notes which would effectively retire a portion of our debt in the spinoff transaction we would distribute the common stock of spinco pro rata to the holders of all of our outstanding common stock as of the record date which would occur following the close of the time warner cable merger after the spinoff transaction a newly formed wholly owned indirect subsidiary of charter would merge with and into charter with the effect that all shares of charter would be converted into shares of a new holding company which would survive as the publicly traded parent company of charter “new charter” new charter would then acquire an interest in spinco by issuing new charter stock in exchange for a portion of the outstanding spinco stock following which it is expected that comcast shareholders would own approximately 67 of spinco and new charter would own approximately 33 of spinco in addition comcast shareholders would own new charter stock as a result of the exchange of outstanding spinco stock with new charter although the actual number of shares would depend on a number of factors some of which would not be determinable until the completion of the divestiture transactions following the close of the divestiture transactions we would no longer have any ownership interest in spinco 

the close of the divestiture transactions is subject to the completion of the time warner cable merger the spinco financing transactions approval by charter’s stockholders regulatory approvals and other customary conditions the time warner cable merger and the divestiture transactions are subject to separate conditions and the time warner cable merger can be completed regardless of whether the divestiture transactions are ultimately completed the closing of the divestiture transactions is expected to occur 30 to 60 days following the close of the time warner cable merger 

competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers 

competition for our bundled cable services that include video highspeed internet andor voices services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete 

  

 

 in all of our service areas and phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 55 of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks our highspeed internet services primarily compete with phone companies with fiberbased networks which overlap approximately 60 of our service areas and also are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks many of these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for these services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer in may 2014 att our largest phone company competitor announced its intention to acquire directv the nation’s largest dbs provider if completed this transaction will create an even larger competitor for our cable services that will have the ability to expand its cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings 

there also continue to be new companies some with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with some or all of our cable services for example companies continue to emerge that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee and google is providing highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and recently announced plans to expand into additional geographical areas moreover wireless technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our video and highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace landline phones with mobile phones and internetbased phone services such as skype 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal also must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses 

technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior services and devices that enable online digital distribution of movies television shows and other cable and broadcast video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance and evolve including some services that charge a nominal or no fee for such programming a number of companies have announced plans to launch online video services that will reportedly involve both linear and ondemand programming and one traditional provider of cable services has begun to offer smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the internet at prices lower than our traditional cable service package offerings these services and devices may negatively affect demand for our video services as well as demand for content from our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses as the number of entertainment choices available to consumers increases and the challenges posed by audience fragmentation intensify and audience ratings are pressured in addition delayed viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of dvrs and similar products has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video on demand services and internet sources which may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue 

in our cable communications segment we believe that adding more content and delivering it through an increasing variety of platforms will assist in attracting and retaining customers for our cable services to further enhance our video and highspeed internet services we continue to develop and launch new technology initiatives such as our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology and deploy wireless gateway devices in our nbcuniversal segments to compete for consumers of our content and for customers at our theme parks we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in acquiring content and producing original content for our cable and broadcast television networks and our owned local broadcast television stations including the acquisition of sports rights we will also continue to invest in our film productions and in the development of new theme park attractions 

  

 

 for additional information on the competition facing our businesses see item 1 business and refer to the “competition” discussion within that section 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels our us advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical with a benefit in evennumbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year our revenue and operating costs and expenses are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games which affects our cable networks and broadcast television segments and the super bowl which affects our broadcast television segment our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of our films in movie theaters on dvd and electronically through digital distributors release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods

the following graph illustrates the increase in consolidated costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization “operating costs and expenses” by our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments 

 

 

in 2014 our consolidated operating costs and expenses included transactionrelated costs associated with the time warner cable merger and the charter divestiture transactions of 237 million which is included in corporate and other and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics which is included in the nbcuniversal segments the decrease in operating costs and expenses in our nbcuniversal segments in 2013 was primarily due to operating costs and expenses recorded in 2012 attributable to our broadcasts of the 2012 super bowl and the 2012 london olympics 

operating costs and expenses for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “segment operating results” operating costs and expenses for our other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “corporate and other results of operations” 

consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2014 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments as well as increases related to our acquisitions in 2013 of our corporate headquarters and real estate properties by nbcuniversal consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2013 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and theme parks segments as well as depreciation associated with the acquisition of real estate properties by nbcuniversal in 2013 

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing 

  

 

 our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 18 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 17 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

beginning in 2014 fandango our movie ticketing and entertainment business that was previously presented in our cable networks segment is presented in the filmed entertainment segment to reflect the change in our management reporting presentation due to immateriality prior period amounts have not been adjusted 

the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics were reported in our cable networks and broadcast television segments the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 london olympics and the 2012 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment 

cable communications segment results of operations 

 

 

  

 

  beginning in 2014 our cable communications segment revised the methodology it uses for counting and reporting customers who reside in multiple dwelling units “mdus” and are billed under bulk contracts the “billable customers method” for mdus whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services such as additional programming choices or our hd or dvr advanced services we now count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services the mdu is now counted as a single customer previously we had counted and reported these customers on an equivalent billing unit basis by dividing monthly revenue received under an mdu’s bulk contract by the standard monthly residential rate where the mdu was located the “ebu method” we believe the billable customers method is consistent with the methodology used by other companies in our industry to count and report customers 

customer metrics 

 

 customer metrics include residential and business customers and are presented based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

  

 

   

  

  

 cable communications segment – revenue 

our cable communications segment leverages our existing cable distribution system to grow revenue by among other things adding new customers encouraging existing cable customers to add new or highertier services and expanding our other services such as our business services offerings and our home security and automation services we offer our cable services in bundles and often provide promotional incentives we seek to balance promotional offers and rate increases with their expected effects on the number of customers and overall revenue 

video 

video revenue increased 12 and 29 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the increases in revenue in both years were due to increases in the number of customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments partially offset by decreases in the number of residential video customers the increases in customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service accounted for increases in revenue of 27 and 47 in 2014 and 2013 respectively as of december 31 2014 130 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 125 million customers and 118 million customers as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively while we had rate adjustments in both 2014 and 2013 rate adjustments were not as significant in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in the number of residential video customers in 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas from phone and dbs competitors and the impact of rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2014 409 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 419 and 430 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers 

highspeed internet 

highspeed internet revenue increased 95 and 83 in 2014 and 2013 respectively increases in the number of residential customers receiving our highspeed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 59 and 60 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the remaining increases in revenue in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to higher rates from customers receiving higher levels of service and from rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2014 402 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 384 and 364 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively our customer base continues to grow as consumers continue to choose our highspeed internet services and seek higherspeed offerings 

voice 

voice revenue increased 04 and 28 in 2014 and 2013 respectively while the growth rate of residential customer additions slowed in 2014 the increase in the number of residential customers receiving our voice services through our discounted bundled offerings accounted for increases in revenue of 51 and 60 in 

  

 

 2014 and 2013 respectively the increases in revenue were partially offset in both years by the impact of the allocation of voice revenue for our bundled customers the amounts allocated to voice revenue in the bundled rate decreased in 2014 and 2013 because video and highspeed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat 

as of december 31 2014 205 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services compared to 199 and 187 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

business services 

business services revenue increased 219 and 264 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to a higher number of small business customers receiving our highspeed internet and voice services the remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in the number of customers receiving our ethernet network and cellular backhaul services 

in 2014 our mediumsized business customers represented 22 of total business services revenue compared to 19 and 15 in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing 

advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our spotlight business sells to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising units are sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions 

advertising revenue increased 115 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue of 80 as well as an increase in revenue in our national and local advertising markets excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased 35 in 2014 advertising revenue decreased 42 in 2013 primarily due to lower political advertising revenue excluding the impact of political advertising revenue advertising revenue increased 48 in 2013 primarily due to increases in our national and regional advertising markets 

other 

we receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees we also receive revenue related to our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services such as our home security and automation services cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our cable franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply 

other revenue increased 49 and 105 in 2014 and 2013 respectively primarily due to increases in revenue from our home security and automation services as well as increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees 

  

 

 cable communications segment – operating costs and expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margin which is our operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for 2014 2013 and 2012 was 410 411 and 410 respectively 

programming expenses 

programming expenses which represent our largest operating expense are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide programming expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in programming license fees including retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs and fees to secure rights for additional programming for our customers across an increasing number of platforms 

we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content including in hd to our video customers as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms including on demand online and through our mobile apps and as the fees we pay increase primarily retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers 

technical and product support expenses 

technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities as well as costs for network operations product development fulfillment and provisioning technical and product support expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to expenses related to the development delivery and support of our enhanced devices and services including our x1 platform cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways and the continued growth in business services the increase in 2014 was also due to expenses related to our home security and automation services and the increase in 2013 was also due to customer fulfillment activities

 home entertainment revenue decreased in 2014 primarily due to the strong performance of our 2013 releases including despicable me 2 and fast and furious 6  home entertainment revenue remained flat in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the number of releases in 2013 compared to 2012 offset by the strong performance of despicable me 2 and fast and furious 6 

the overall dvd market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distributors and subscription rental services all of which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales 

other 

we also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays from distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties and from a movie ticketing and entertainment business 

other revenue increased in 2014 primarily due to the inclusion of fandango in 2014 which was previously presented in our cable networks segment other revenue increased slightly in 2013 primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from our stage plays 

filmed entertainment segment – operating costs and expenses 

programming and production costs 

programming and production costs include the amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs residual and participation payments and distribution expenses residual payments represent amounts payable to certain of our employees including freelance and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions or guilds and are based on posttheatrical revenue participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent third parties that have entered into cofinancing agreements with us and other parties involved in the production of a film 

programming and production costs decreased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to lower amortization of film costs associated with the lower costs of our 2014 and 2013 film slates compared to their respective prior years 

other operating and administrative costs and expenses 

other operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries employee benefits rent and other overhead expenses 

other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2014 primarily due to the inclusion of fandango in 2014 which was previously presented in our cable networks segment other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to the realization of a receivable in 2012 that was previously reserved for as uncollectible 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of dvds we incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters as a result we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits if any until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue the costs associated with producing and marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future 

advertising marketing and promotion expenses decreased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to fewer significant theatrical releases compared to their respective prior years

 interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2014 primarily due to the effects of our interest rate derivative financial instruments interest expense increased in 2013 primarily due to an increase in our debt outstanding partially offset by a lower average cost of debt 

investment income loss net 

the changes in investment income loss net in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the 443 million gain that was recorded in 2013 related to the sale of our investment in clearwire corporation in july 2013 the components of investment income loss net in 2014 2013 and 2012 are presented in a table in note 7 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements 

equity in net income losses of investees net 

the change in equity in net income loss of investees net in 2014 was primarily due to 142 million of total equity losses recorded in 2013 attributable to our investment in hulu llc “hulu” in july 2013 we entered into an agreement to provide capital contributions totaling 247 million to hulu which we had previously accounted for as a cost method investment this represented an agreement to provide our first capital contribution to hulu since we acquired our interest in it as part of our acquisition of a controlling interest in nbcuniversal llc “nbcuniversal holdings” in 2011 the “nbcuniversal transaction” therefore we began 

  

 

 to apply the equity method of accounting for this investment the change in the method of accounting for this investment required us to recognize our proportionate share of hulu’s accumulated losses from the date of the nbcuniversal transaction through july 2013 the change in equity in net income loss net in 2013 was primarily due to 876 million of income that was recorded in 2012 related to our portion of a gain on the sale of advanced wireless services spectrum licenses through our investment in spectrumco as well as 142 million of total equity losses recorded in 2013 attributable to our investment in hulu 

other income expense net 

the change in other income expense net in 2014 was primarily due to the net impact of an impairment of 236 million of our equity method investment in and loans with a regional sports cable network based in houston texas and a 108 million gain related to our sale of wireless communications spectrum licenses in 2013 as well as a 27 million favorable settlement of a contingency recorded in 2014 related to the att broadband transaction in 2002 the change in other income expense net in 2013 was primarily due to a 1 billion gain recorded in 2012 related to the sale of our investment in ae television networks llc “ae television networks” as well as the net impact of the 236 million impairment related to our equity method investment in a regional sports cable network and a 108 million gain related to our sale of wireless communications spectrum licenses in 2013 

consolidated income tax expense 

 

income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions and until we acquired general electric company’s “ge” 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal holdings that we did not already own in march 2013 the “nbcuniversal redemption transaction” the partnership structure of nbcuniversal holdings whereby income tax expense was not recorded on the portion of its consolidated income that was attributable to ge’s noncontrolling interest our effective income tax rate in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 311 358 and 323 respectively 

in september 2014 we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions and as a result our income tax expense decreased by 724 million see note 15 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on the changes in our accruals for uncertain tax positions and related interest on these tax positions in 2013 our effective income tax rate increased compared to 2012 due to the nbcuniversal redemption transaction following which we recorded income tax expense on all of nbcuniversal’s consolidated income in addition our 2013 income tax expense was reduced by 158 million due to the nontaxable portion of the increase in tax basis associated with the redemption of liberty media series a common stock in october 2013 

our income tax expense in the future may continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in tax laws we expect our 2015 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 37 to 39 absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions in addition the time warner cable merger and the divestiture transactions may result in changes to our existing deferred income tax liabilities due to changes in the apportionment factors related to state income taxes any such changes will be reflected in income tax expense as of the respective closing dates 

consolidated net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 

 

the decreases in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the nbcuniversal redemption transaction 

  

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to meet our debt repayment obligations to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities and to return capital to shareholders 

we also maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements 

our commercial paper programs provide a lowercost source of borrowing to fund our shortterm working capital requirements these commercial paper programs are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and our 100 owned cable holding company subsidiaries comcast cable communications llc “cccl parent” comcast mo group inc “comcast mo group” comcast cable holdings llc “cch” and comcast mo of delaware llc “comcast mo of delaware” collectively the “cable guarantors” as well as by nbcuniversal the comcast commercial paper program is supported by the comcast and comcast cable communications llc 625 billion revolving credit facility due june 2017 

in february 2014 nbcuniversal enterprise inc “nbcuniversal enterprise” entered into a commercial paper program the maximum borrowing capacity under this commercial paper program is 135 billion and it is supported by nbcuniversal enterprise’s 135 billion revolving credit facility due march 2018 

as of december 31 2014 amounts available under our consolidated revolving credit facilities net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit totaled 65 billion which included 505 million available under the nbcuniversal enterprise revolving credit facility 

we nbcuniversal and the cable guarantors that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the comcast and comcast cable communications llc revolving credit facility we test for compliance with the covenants for this credit facility on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant is in this credit facility and pertains to leverage which is the ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility as of december 31 2014 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin we do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant 

  

 

 operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2014 compared to the changes in 2013 were primarily related to the timing of film and television production spending and related costs net of amortization of approximately 600 million 

the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2013 compared to the changes in 2012 were primarily due to the timing of receipts for our accounts receivable increases in deferred revenue associated with our olympics broadcasts and a decrease in film and television costs the increases were partially offset by payments made in 2013 related to the termination of a film financing arrangement and payments of our accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors as well as the timing of other operating items 

interest payments remained relatively flat in 2014 and 2013 

the decrease in income tax payments in 2014 was primarily due to the settlement of tax disputes and the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2013 the decrease was partially offset by higher taxable income from operations and the net impact of the economic stimulus legislation in 2014 the increase in income tax payments in 2013 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations the net impact of the economic stimulus legislation the settlement of tax disputes and the repatriation of foreign earnings we expect income tax payments to increase in 2015 primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and the net impact of economic stimulus legislation

net cash used in investing activities in 2014 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures and intangible assets net cash used in investing activities in 2013 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures acquisitions and construction of real estate properties purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets net cash used in investing activities in 2012 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures intangible assets and purchases of investments which was substantially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments and return of capital from investees 

  

 

 capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 cable communications capital expenditures increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to an increase in customer premise equipment purchases including purchases related to our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology as well as purchases related to our wireless gateways in 2013 and increased investment in business services and network infrastructure to increase network capacity 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 53 to 12 billion in 2014 and 520 to 12 billion in 2013 primarily due to continued investment in our universal theme parks 

our capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to increase as we continue to invest in the deployment of our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology and the expansion of business services and our home security and automation services we also expect capital expenditures to increase in 2015 as a result of integration efforts following the close of the time warner cable merger capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes the timing and rate of deployment of new services and the capacity required for existing services in addition we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of repurchases of our common stock repayments of debt and dividend payments which were partially offset by proceeds from new borrowings proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions see note 10 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings 

share repurchases and dividends 

in january 2014 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to 75 billion the authorization allows us to repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions and does not have an expiration date in 2014 we repurchased a total of 81 million shares of our class a special and class a common stock for 425 billion which includes 125 billion of the additional 25 billion of shares we committed to repurchase following the shareholder approvals for the time warner cable merger in addition because we and time warner cable have received shareholder approval for the merger we intend to repurchase an additional 125 billion of shares through the close of the time warner cable merger in early 2015 subject to market conditions as of december 31 2014 we had 325 billion remaining under the board’s authorization 

in february 2015 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to 10 billion which does not have an expiration date under this authorization we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions we expect to repurchase 425 billion of shares during 2015 including the remaining 125 billion of additional shares we committed to repurchase in connection with the time warner cable merger subject to market conditions additional share repurchases above the 425 billion commitment in 2015 will be determined following the close of the time warner cable merger and the related divestiture transactions with charter

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 3 to each of comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights the accounting for film and television costs and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 9 6 and 15 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may 

  

 

 bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2014 we performed a quantitative assessment of our cable franchise rights based on our quantitative analysis the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the northeast central and west divisions by 26 50 and 42 respectively 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including home entertainment and other distribution platforms are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

  

 

 capitalized film and television costs as well as stage play production costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of 26 million 167 million and 161 million were recorded in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions certain financing transactions and the allocation of income among state and local taxing jurisdictions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period in september 2014 we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions the reduction resulted in a decrease of 724 million in income tax expense which excludes the benefits of uncertain tax positions for which we have been indemnified as of december 31 2014 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were 12 billion and 452 million respectively 

  

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program comcast’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of comcast’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2014 to 887 from 952 nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of nbcuniversal’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2014 to 955 from 999 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease comcast’s consolidated interest expense by 66 million 98 million and 106 million respectively the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on comcast’s interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes as of december 31 2014 the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments by contractual year of maturity subject to interest rate risk maintained by us 

 

 the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps in the table above includes 11 million associated with interest rate swaps held by nbcuniversal 

we use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2014 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2014 

  

 

 see note 2 to each of the comcast and nbcuniversal consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar value of our nonus revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations nbcuniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposures nbcuniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy nbcuniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances nbcuniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2014 and 2013 nbcuniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 890 million and 968 million respectively as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2014 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for those assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between the functional currency and the us dollar our analysis of such a shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2014 income 

comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was an asset of 37 million and 73 million respectively 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

comcast and nbcuniversal manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant comcast has agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties’ credit ratings as of december 31 2014 and 2013 comcast was not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements as of december 31 2014 the collateral that comcast held from certain of its counterparties under the terms of these agreements was not material

competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas and phone companies which overlap approximately 45 of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for cable services that are comparable to the pricing and services we offer there also continue to be new companies some with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services for example companies continue to emerge that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming some of which charge a 

  

 

 nominal or no fee and google recently launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas moreover wireless technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our video and highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as a result of wireless and internetbased phone services 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

 we also may compete with online digital distributors that offer online services and devices that enable internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming 

in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings see “legislation and regulation” below for additional information 

direct broadcast satellite providers 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to 34 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberopticbased networks that provide video and highspeed internet services in substantial portions of our service areas these and other phone companies also may market video services provided by dbs providers in certain areas where they provide only highspeed internet and phone services 

other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have significant financial resources have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable 

  

 

 systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and business subscribers 

other 

we may also compete with newer online services from digital distributors that enable internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming and in some cases charge a nominal or no fee additionally we may compete with consumer electronic companies that sell internetconnected tvs or gaming consoles that provide their own user interface for searching tv programs and offer links to various thirdparty apps the success of these newer services could negatively impact demand for our video services including for our dvr premium network on demand and streaming services 

our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free overtheair programming as well as newer services that provide programming from such broadcasts online for a fee as well as video rental services and home entertainment products 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

  

 digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased data transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas additionally google recently launched highspeed internet services in a limited number of areas 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet networks and wifi networks some of these services are similar to ours these networks work with devices such as wireless data cards and wireless embedded devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers that connect to such embedded devices in addition a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi 

  

 

 service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks the availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our highspeed internet services 

voice services 

our voice services compete with wireline phone companies including incumbent local exchange carriers “ilecs” competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other voip service providers certain phone companies such as the ilecs att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources in addition we are increasingly competing with wireless phone service providers as people substitute mobile phones for landline phones and with internetbased phone services 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including ilecs and clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who provide video offerings for businesses

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks local broadcast television stations home entertainment payperview and videoondemand services online activities such as social networking and viewing usergenerated content and other forms of entertainment news and information our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations may compete for viewers’ attention with digital distributors some of which have their own highquality original content 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks local television stations and online digital distributors the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and online digital distributors our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties creative performing and technical personnel and with distributors for their content and for consumer interest in their content 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well 

  

 

 as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds and with digital distributors for the licensing and sale of its products 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities in order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure the investment required to introduce new attractions in our theme parks can be significant 

advertising 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites additionally advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of new technologies such as dvrs which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — seasonality and cyclicality” for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses which are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities in addition our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the doj and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years after september 2011 legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses for example congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals addressing communications issues including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for the everevolving communications marketplace whether it should reform retransmission consent and whether it should address the fcc’s authority to implement open internet regulations we are unable to predict any such changes or how any such changes would ultimately affect our businesses the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 

  

 

 cable communications segment 

 

video services 

program carriage 

the communications act and fcc regulations prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video providers from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc has adopted regulations that we believe increase the likelihood of program carriage complaints and is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us in july 2012 the fcc ruled against us in a program carriage complaint initiated by the tennis channel we challenged that decision in court and the federal courts overturned it although the tennis channel is seeking further judicial review from the supreme court in addition the nbcuniversal order prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage and requires that if we place news andor business news channels in a channel lineup “neighborhood” we must place all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood bloomberg television filed a complaint at the fcc invoking this condition the fcc ruled substantially in favor of bloomberg but did not grant all of the relief bloomberg had requested both comcast and bloomberg have challenged the fcc’s ruling in court and those cases are pending we have been involved in other program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future adverse decisions in disputes under the program carriage regulations or nbcuniversal order conditions could negatively affect our business 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations alternatively local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station gives up its mustcarry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator such an agreement may involve payments to the station we are currently paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “nbcuniversal segments — broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates as a result approximately 80 of our video services customers are not subject to rate regulation from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered 

  

 

 directly by the cable operator while we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access to date the fcc has adopted regulations that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although their implementation has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the office of management and budget if implemented these regulations could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such regulations 

cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services with the exception of certain oneway devices like digital transport adapters these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result most settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard in addition the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets and other equipment that can connect directly to a cable system with a cablecard and receive oneway video services without the need for a settop box the regulations also require cable operators to provide a credit to customers who use plugandplay equipment purchased at retail and to allow them to selfinstall cablecards rather than having to arrange for professional installation a federal court vacated some of these cablecard rules in a decision in january 2013 the fcc has sought comment on an equipment manufacturer’s proposal that the fcc readopt these rules and also has received requests that it supplant cablecards with another technology that would enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider system not just a cable system we are unable to predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our cable business 

in december 2013 we other multichannel video providers equipment manufacturers and other entities announced a voluntary agreement taking steps to improve the energy efficiency of settop boxes in response the department of energy terminated a rulemaking it had initiated in this area however proposals to impose energy efficiency requirements on settop boxes and network equipment continue to be considered at the state level and we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted in the future in addition the nbcuniversal order requires us to fulfill commitments designed to improve the parental control tools and information available to parents including providing navigation and blocking capabilities for certain settop boxes 

mdus and inside wiring 

fcc regulations prohibit exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus or other private residential real estate developments as well as our enforcement of exclusivity provisions in any of our preexisting access agreements fcc regulations also facilitate competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such properties 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards until recently the pole attachment rates applicable to telecommunications services were significantly higher than the rates we currently pay for cable and other services in february 2013 a federal court upheld the fcc’s pole rate formula that reduces the rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels that are at or near the rates for cable attachments but utility companies are able to rebut certain presumptions in the new formula and it is expected that most will attempt to do so 

  

 

 vertical ownership limit 

the fcc is assessing whether to revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming channels that a cable operator may carry on a cable system the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels carried on a cable system was struck down by a federal appellate court in 2001 although the fcc continues to enforce it the fcc previously clarified that under the 40 limit cable systems with 75 or more channels must carry at least 45 unaffiliated channels our cable systems routinely carry more than 45 unaffiliated channels and we currently comply with the 40 limit compliance could become more difficult depending on what regulations if any the fcc adopts 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access “peg” programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the nbcuniversal order contains various pegrelated conditions including a requirement that we do not migrate peg channels to digital delivery on our cable system until the system has converted to alldigital distribution or until the government entity that is responsible for the system’s peg operations expressly agrees the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable 

fcc regulations establish franchising processes and obligations for new entrants that are different from those applicable to existing providers for example these regulations limit the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants and preempt certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the satellite television extension and localism act of 2010 “stela” which expires in 2014 made several revisions to the cable operator’s compulsory copyright license including clarifying that cable operators must pay additional royalty fees for each digital multicast programming stream from an outof market broadcast station they retransmit that does not duplicate the content of the station’s primary stream it also establishes an audit mechanism for copyright owners to review a cable operator’s copyright royalty reporting practices which the copyright office is now in the process of implementing extension of stela will be an issue that congress addresses in 2014 as required by stela the copyright office the gao and the fcc all issued reports to congress in 2011 that generally supported an eventual phaseout of the compulsory licenses although they also acknowledged the potential adverse impact on cable 

  

 

 and satellite subscribers and the absence of any clear marketplace alternative to the compulsory licenses if adopted a phaseout plan could adversely affect our ability to obtain broadcast station programming and substantially increase our programming costs 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable distribution system in 2002 the fcc ruled that highspeed internet services such as ours are interstate information services that are not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

in 2010 the fcc adopted “open internet” regulations applicable to broadband internet service providers “isps” the regulations required broadband isps such as us to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service the “transparency rule” barred broadband isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and barred wireline broadband isps such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the noblocking and nondiscrimination requirements allowed for reasonable network management the fcc did not prohibit speed tiers or usagebased pricing but specifically noted that “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing of its own internet content likely would violate these regulations in january 2014 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated all of the fcc’s rules except for the transparency rule but the court clarified that the fcc had the fundamental authority to regulate broadband internet access services as a general matter nevertheless comcast remains bound by the fcc’s original “open internet” regulations as a condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree for the remainder of the term of those orders the requirements apply to any broadband internet access service that we provide to consumers regardless of whether it is accessed through a settop box gaming console computer or other device it is possible that the fcc may seek to adopt new internet regulations or take other actions that restrict the manner in which we and other isps provide internet services the fcc also may attempt to reclassify broadband internet service as a “telecommunications service” which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act under a title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rates for broadband internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content application and service providers including backbone connection arrangements the fcc might also take a broader view of its existing authority as confirmed by the court decision to adopt any regulation that conceivably would promote broadband deployment and adoption so long as it is not a common carrier regulation and states may also attempt to regulate the internet pursuant to the court’s decision 

the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree also include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas to continue to offer all of our highspeed internet service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to offer a new standalone 6 mbps downstream tier known as the performance starter tier for 4995 per month for three years to maintain a highspeed internet service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to not discriminate in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our highspeed internet service but not including our highspeed internet service video services or voice services we have taken a number of steps to comply with these conditions in 2012 after an fcc inquiry into whether we failed to comply with the standalone broadband condition we entered into a consent decree with the fcc to extend our offering of the performance starter tier for one additional year until febru 

  

 

 ary 2015 and to reinforce the promotion of our standalone broadband offerings including training our sales representatives with respect to these offerings 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and to lowincome consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers the fcc issued an order in november 2011 that changed the way that a majority of universal service funds are allocated and began implementing that order in 2012 by focusing on broadband and wireless deployment and moving away from supporting traditional telephone service the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings while others could receive less funding the actual impact of the changes is not yet known the fcc’s ruling is under review in federal court 

in addition in november 2011 the fcc initiated a further rulemaking on ip interconnection issues that may have an impact on internet interconnection arrangements we have a number of peering and transit arrangements with other network operators and these arrangements historically have not been regulated by the fcc the fcc chairman however has stressed that the fcc has a responsibility to ensure “connectivity” of the internet and although he has made clear that he does not consider peering and transit arrangements to be an “open internet” issue he considers it a related issue that the fcc at a minimum should monitor we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business 

in addition congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email for example in 1998 the internet tax freedom act was enacted in an effort to promote use of the internet and it has been extended three times but is scheduled to expire on november 1 2014 unless it is extended again state and local governments also have adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service expanded copyright protection requirements taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

voice services 

we provide voice services by using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance calea outage reporting rural call completion reporting universal service fund contribution obligations domestic discontinuance requirements and certain regulatory filing requirements the fcc has not yet ruled on whether interconnected voip service should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are still regulated more pervasively than information services the regulatory environment for our voice services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip service state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services for example in vermont following a court remand faulting the state commission for failing to consider certain arguments in finding that our voice services are telephone services subject to state regulation the state commission is continuing a proceeding into how to classify our voice services a number of states have enacted laws that preclude state public utility regulation of voipbased services notwithstanding how they are classified under federal law 

  

 

 because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services the precise scope of interconnection regulations applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear in light of this uncertainty providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our affiliated clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in all of these challenges and no such challenges are currently pending however if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted in december 2012 the fcc sought comment on two petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for ip voice providers and it also formed a task force to coordinate the fcc’s efforts on issues related to the transition of networks from circuitswitched to packetswitched technology including the issue of ip interconnection the fcc has refocused on these issues and has suggested that progress should be expected in 2014 we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business further a massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether ip interconnection agreements should be subject to regulation and other states could follow in november 2011 the fcc issued an order clarifying the entire intercarrier compensation system which governs the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic whether it be for local intrastate or interstate traffic or voip the fcc order affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers however that order is currently under appeal in federal court 

other cable services regulations 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and voice services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

nbcuniversal segments 

 

cable networks 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators other than terrestrially delivered programming networks from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers such as dbs providers and phone companies that offer multichannel video programming services in addition the communications act and fcc regulations had limited the ability of cableaffiliated cable networks to offer exclusive programming contracts to a cable operator in october 2012 the fcc allowed a preemptive restriction on exclusive contracts to expire but reaffirmed that any such exclusive contract could be reviewed on a casebycase basis in response to a complaint alleging violation of the communications act’s prohibition against unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices that hinder significantly or prevent competitors from providing programming to customers in addition the fcc 

  

 

 is considering proposals to establish presumptions that would make it easier for multichannel video providers to succeed with complaints involving exclusive contracts and to make it easier for them to use buying groups and for such buying groups to pursue complaints under the rules it is uncertain whether the fcc will act on these proposals and if adopted what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks 

the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2007 to consider whether companies that own multiple cable networks should be required to make each of their networks available to multichannel video providers on a standalone or “unbundled” basis when negotiating distribution agreements although it has not further acted on that rulemaking we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled and when requested on a standalone basis increased regulatory requirements imposed on the manner in which we negotiate programming distribution agreements with multichannel video providers may adversely affect our cable networks business in addition various legislative proposals have been introduced in congress that if ever enacted would mandate that programmers offer cable networks to multichannel video providers on an a la carte basis and would provide certain programaccess rights and protections to online video distributors it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will ever be adopted and if adopted what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order multichannel video providers can invoke commercial arbitration for program access in certain circumstances against our cable networks and broadcast television networks including our regional sports networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability of and the price terms and conditions of access to such programming for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” and “internet distribution” discussions within that section 

children’s programming 

the children’s television act “cta” and fcc regulations limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age fcc regulations also limit the display during children’s programming on cable or broadcast of internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products similarly fcc regulations prohibit the display of commercials during children’s programming on cable or broadcast networks that use program characters to sell products when the commercial is adjacent to children’s programming in which the characters appear the fcc is currently considering whether to prohibit interactive advertising during children’s television programming the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children including commitments that we will not insert interactive advertising into children’s television programming in any of the advertising spots we control either as a multichannel video provider or as the programmer and that we will provide at least 15 million worth of public service announcements on childhood obesity fda nutritional guidelines digital literacy and parental controls per year until 2016 

broadcast television 

licensing 

the communications act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time and upon application may renew the licenses for additional terms under the communications act broadcast 

  

 

 television licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations and there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse 

in addition cta and fcc regulations require that the fcc consider in its review of broadcast television station license renewals whether the station has served the educational and informational “ei” needs of children under the fcc’s regulations a station licensee will be deemed to have met its obligation to serve the ei needs of children if it has broadcast on its main program stream a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has a significant purpose of serving the ei needs of children under 17 years of age for broadcast television stations that multicast fcc regulations include a similar standard whereby the amount of ei programming deemed to meet the station’s ei obligation increases in proportion to the amount of free multicast programming aired under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to provide an additional hour of ei programming per week on either the primary or multicast streams of our owned nbc local broadcast television stations and on the primary signal of our owned telemundo local broadcast television stations the fcc is considering whether the requirements for ei programming have been effective in promoting the availability of educational content for children on broadcast television and there can be no assurance that the fcc will not impose more stringent requirements 

under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to expand local news and information programming on our owned local television stations and to enter into cooperative arrangements with locally focused nonprofit news organizations in certain markets we have met all of these commitments 

renewal applications are pending for a number of our broadcast television station licenses the fcc may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted a station’s authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review four pending applications have been formally opposed by third parties and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations’ programming the communications act also requires prior fcc approval for any sale of a broadcast station license whether through the assignment of the license and related assets from one company to another or the transfer of control of the stock or other equity of a company holding an fcc license third parties may oppose such applications the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals or that approvals in the future will contain acceptable fcc license conditions 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific levels in local television stations as well as other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc by law must review the ownership regulations detailed below once every four years the current review which officially opened in 2010 led to proposals in december 2011 “2011 media ownership notice” for relaxing some limits but retaining others the fcc has not yet adopted an order in the 2010 proceeding although the communications act requires that the agency launch its next ownership review proceeding in 2014 we cannot predict when the fcc’s current review will be completed or whether or how any of these regulations will change 

local television ownership 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the 

  

 

 market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the fcc and at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition further without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same dma so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap the 2011 media ownership notice proposes minor modifications to the local television ownership rule it also raises questions regarding whether local newssharing agreements shared services agreements and joint sales agreements that involve the right to jointly negotiate retransmission consent should count toward the fcc’s ownership limitations the stations owned by the nbc network or the telemundo network however do not have agreements that involve the right to jointly negotiate retransmission consent 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of television stations one entity may own or control nationally under the rule no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households our owned local television station reach does not exceed this limit in september 2013 the fcc launched a rulemaking that considers eliminating a rule that currently affords uhf stations channels 14 and above a 50 discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap adoption of this proposed change would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership ie through one or more subsidiaries although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest these limits have been held to apply to both voting control and equity as well as to ownership by any form of entity including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies for many decades the fcc has declined to waive the 25 indirect limit in broadcast transactions but in a november 2013 declaratory ruling the fcc stated that it is now willing to consider such waiver requests 

dual network rule 

the dual network rule prohibits any of the four major broadcast television networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent federal law and fcc regulations also establish a mustcarryretransmission consent election system for carriage of commercial television stations by satellite providers for the period beginning on january 1 2012 and ending on december 31 2014 all of our nbc network and telemundo network owned local television stations except for certain telemundo local television stations acquired in 2013 elected retransmission consent 

in enacting stela in 2010 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations stela expressly extended to january 1 2015 an existing prohibition against commercial television stations entering into exclusive retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video providers and also extended a requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith several other multichannel video providers and third parties filed a petition asking the fcc to initiate a rulemaking to consider changes to the current retransmission consent regulations and also asked congress to review the issue the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2011 that among other things seeks comment on proposals to modify the good faith negotiating standard and to eliminate regulations providing 

  

 

 local television stations with exclusivity protections in their markets for network and syndicated programming legislation has been introduced that would eliminate both mustcarry and retransmission consent as well as more narrow legislation that would aim to resolve impasses in retransmission consent negotiations we cannot predict what new laws or regulations if any may be adopted or how any such laws or regulations would affect our businesses multichannel video providers may also invoke commercial arbitration under rules established in the nbcuniversal order to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations 

internet distribution 

under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding the availability and the price terms and conditions of access to such programming in addition we are required to continue distributing programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent price terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion we are one of three broadcast network owners of hulu but we were required to relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in hulu in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction in compliance with our obligations under the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree we have entered into renewal license agreements with hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners 

broadcast spectrum 

in february 2012 congress authorized the fcc to conduct an incentive auction to reassign a portion of the broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use under the statute broadcasters may voluntarily relinquish some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the fcc’s auction of the spectrum to mobile broadband providers broadcasters that do not voluntarily relinquish their spectrum rights may still be affected as part of the process of clearing and repacking the spectrum for future mobile use but congress required the fcc to make “all reasonable efforts” to preserve broadcasters’ overtheair coverage area and population served and to reimburse those broadcasters’ reasonable costs the fcc currently is conducting a proceeding to implement this statute including establishing processes for how the spectrum will be repacked and how the broadcasters will be reimbursed for relocation costs we cannot predict whether or how any such regulations might affect our businesses 

indecency 

a federal statute and fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm broadcasters risk violating this prohibition because the vagueness of the relevant fcc definitions makes it difficult to apply moreover the fcc has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance” in contrast with its previous policy that had generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation the maximum penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is 350000 per indecent or profane utterance 

indecency regulation has been the subject of recent court review regarding both the fcc’s “fleeting expletives” policy and the fcc’s definition of what constitutes indecent material in june 2012 the us supreme court struck down the fcc’s assessment of indecency fines against abc and fox on the grounds that the agency failed to provide fair notice of its standards and enforcement policy however the court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the fcc’s indecency policy under the first amendment this ruling may result in the fcc’s clarification of its policy and changes to how it approaches future indecencyrelated enforcement actions in this regard in april 2013 the fcc sought public comment regarding its indecency 

  

 

 enforcement policies from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local television stations included indecent or profane material increased content regulation particularly if it is vague and difficult to apply could have an adverse effect on our broadcast television business 

sponsorship identification 

federal legislation and fcc regulations provide that whenever a broadcast station transmits any programming for which it has received money service or other valuable consideration it must provide an accurate onair identification of the sponsor of the programming similar rules apply to cable operators in origination cablecasting eg local origination programming in 2008 the fcc commenced a proceeding to examine whether “embedded advertising” such as product placements and product integration in broadcast programming should be subject to stricter disclosure requirements and whether the sponsorship identification regulations should be extended to cable networks although the fcc has taken no action to date 

international regulation 

international regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes the regulation of programming and advertising for example the european union “eu” establishes minimum levels of regulation across all eu member states focused on content and advertising which also extends to nonlinear television services although eu countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures these laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and in certain instances also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors further under various consent judgments federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the united states including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theaterbytheater basis the federal trade commission “ftc” has called for stronger industry safeguards applicable to the marketing of violent movies to children 

in countries outside the united states there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products including film screen quotas television quotas regulation of content regulated contract terms product safety and labeling requirements discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of us products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and internetdomain laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the 

  

 

 unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations and we cannot predict with certainty what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

there is ongoing litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates and the us supreme court has granted certiorari to hear the broadcasting industry’s challenge to one such entity we also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr none of this litigation is final and the courts have reached different decisions to date additionally there is a pending legislative proposal in the united states that seems intended to legitimize some of these practices there can be no assurance as to whether the courts will ultimately determine that these practices are unlawful or that the pending legislation will be enacted or how any such rulings or legislation would ultimately affect our businesses 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the communications act and fcc regulations also provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services several states and numerous local jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws or franchise privacy provisions that apply to cable services 

the ftc has continued to exercise authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers it also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or disclosure of this type of information in july 2013 ftc regulations implementing the children’s online privacy protection act “coppa” went into effect coppa imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under 13 years of age or that collect personal information or knowingly post personal information from children under 13 years of age the ftc rules impose some significant new obligations on operators of websites and online services including expanded categories of 

  

 

 personal information and new data security and data retention requirements and also expand the scope of coppa to reach thirdparty service providers that knowingly collect personal information through a childdirected website or service 

we are also subject to state and federal regulations and laws regarding information security most of these regulations and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft substantially all of the us states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach in addition we maintain an identity theft program that incorporates the guidance provided under the ftc’s “red flag rules” which are designed to detect the warning signs of identity theft the ftc and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information even in deidentified form these requirements may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required 

in february 2013 the president directed the national institute of standards and technology in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of us critical infrastructure to develop a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized flexible repeatable performancebased and costeffective approach to cyber risk which was released in february 2014 it is a compendium of existing crosssector cyber defense processes practices and protocols that can help companies identify assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities additionally there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately be adopted or how such requirements if any would affect our businesses 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails as well as fcc regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls texts or sms messages additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

advertising restrictions 

legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children and on the deductibility of advertising expenses we are unable to predict whether such reports would result in legislative proposals whether legislative proposals may be adopted or if adopted what impact they would have on our businesses 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities we have been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of nbcuniversal’s current and former facilities and at offsite waste disposal locations although our share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material in addition the california attorney general and the alameda county california district attorney are investigating whether certain of our waste disposal policies procedures and practices are in violation of the california business and professions code and the california health and safety code see item 3 legal proceedings in this part i for more information 

  

 

 environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations we are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses 

disabilities access 

our businesses are subject to a number of requirements related to ensuring that our services are accessible to individuals with disabilities among other things our voice services and email services must be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities we must provide additional narrations of key visual elements referred to as “video description” on certain of our video services and programming and we must include closed captioning on certain video programming delivered to our customers the fcc is very focused on accessibility issues and is currently considering the adoption of additional quality standards for closed captioning the fcc also has adopted rules that will require that onscreen menus and program guides used on settop boxes and other navigation devices to access multichannel video programming be audibly accessible to blind and lowvision customers the fcc is considering further accessibility requirements for multichannel video providers broadcasters and other entities and we cannot predict what impact those further requirements would have on our businesses 

other fcc regulations 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our businesses including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards loudness of commercial advertisements political advertising emergency alert system requirements equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable systems and television stations and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc regulations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 136000 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees approximately 83000 and 40000 were associated with our cable communications business and our nbcuniversal businesses respectively we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

  

 

 additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our businesses results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers there also continue to be new entrants with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services as well as with our cable and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed immediately below in “changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses” 

competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs providers which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas and phone companies which overlap approximately 45 of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks we also compete with other providers of traditional cable services all of these companies typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services companies that offer services that enable internet video streaming and downloading of video programming may also compete with our video services recently google launched highspeed internet and video services in a limited number of areas and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to launch these services in more of our services areas furthermore our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities and may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network such as by increasing the speed of our highspeed internet services by expanding and enhancing our business services to mediumsized businesses and by launching additional services such as our home security and automation services we expect these and other initiatives designed to help us compete effectively such as deploying our x1 platform and wireless gateways will require increased capital spending there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses for example our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home such as video games dvds and websites in addition our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and online digital distributors our filmed entertainment business competes with other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for sources of financing for the production 

  

 

 of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds and with digital distributors for the licensing and sale of its products it also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites additionally our ability to compete depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and governmental authorities 

for a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses see “business – competition” above there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses 

we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment new technologies particularly alternative methods for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and that drive changes in consumer behavior these technologies may affect demand for all of our products and services as the number of entertainment choices available to and the manner in which they are delivered to consumers continue to increase and evolve our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

newer services and technologies that may compete with our video services include digital distribution services and devices that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers as well as other devices such as smartphones and tablets some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content which could adversely affect demand for our video services including for premium networks and our dvr on demand and streaming services in addition consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information entertainment and communications services anywhere and anytime they want newer services in wireless internet technology such as 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as wireless data cards tablets smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services are facing increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services the success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our cable communications’ competitive position business and results of operations 

new technologies are also affecting consumer behavior in ways that are changing how content is viewed as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content which may have a negative impact on our businesses and results of operations for example the increased availability of dvrs videoondemand services and cable broadcast and other video programming on the internet including highquality original video programming that may be viewed only through digital distribution services as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets which could adversely affect the demand for our video services the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to nbcuniversal for its content and the levels of dvd and theatrical sales these new technologies have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation some of these newer technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within programming which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive delayed 

  

 

 viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of dvrs has increased and as content has become increasingly available via videoondemand services and internet sources some of these new technologies are also challenging the existing legal copyright framework that we rely on to protect and monetize our intellectual property rights as more fully discussed below in “our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others” these and other changes in technology distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example some companies are building costly fiberoptic networks that provide significant highspeed internet access speeds and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected moreover we may incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives such as the deployment of our x1 platform and wireless gateways we also may incur increased costs if changes in the products and services that our competitors offer require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms we incur increased programming expenses additionally we are currently paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our businesses could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip voice service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases may adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations and our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme 

  

 

 park operations in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect our businesses for example in 2010 the fcc adopted “open internet” regulations applicable to broadband internet service providers “isps” the regulations required broadband isps such as us to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service the “transparency rule” barred broadband isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and barred wireline broadband isps such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the noblocking and nondiscrimination requirements allowed for reasonable network management the fcc did not prohibit speed tiers or usagebased pricing but specifically noted that “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing of its own internet content likely would violate these regulations in january 2014 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated all of the fcc’s rules except for the transparency rule but the court clarified that the fcc had the fundamental authority to regulate broadband internet access services as a general matter although we remain bound by the fcc’s original “open internet” regulations as a condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree for the remainder of the term of those orders it is possible that the fcc may appeal the court’s decision or seek to adopt new internet regulations or take other actions that restrict the manner in which we and other isps provide internet services the fcc also may attempt to reclassify broadband internet service as a “telecommunications service” which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act under a title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rates for broadband internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content application and service providers including backbone connection arrangements these arrangements historically have not been regulated by the fcc the fcc chairman however has stressed that the fcc has a responsibility to ensure “connectivity” of the internet and although he has made clear that he does not consider peering and transit arrangements to be an “open internet” issue he considers it a related issue that the fcc at a minimum should monitor the fcc might also take a broader view of its existing authority as confirmed by the court decision to adopt any regulation that conceivably would promote broadband deployment and adoption so long as it is not a common carrier regulation and states may also attempt to regulate the internet pursuant to the court’s decision we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses see “business – legislation and regulation” above 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions weak economic conditions or increases in price levels generally due to inflationary pressures could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as internet video streaming and downloading services or substitute services such as mobile phones smartphones and wifi networks weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses weak economic conditions could also reduce the fees that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks’ programming and 

  

 

 for the retransmission of our broadcast television networks and stations’ content weak economic conditions have also in the past reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our home entertainment releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending in our theme parks business weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us further any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms if these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate our businesses may be adversely affected 

a decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or by the economy in general any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings which some of our cable networks have experienced and may continue to experience advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected by changes in audience measurement methodologies for example newer methods of viewing content such as delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content on computers tablets or smartphones might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue further natural disasters wars acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty reductions in advertising expenditures could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content which is difficult to predict and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs moreover particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to impose surcharges on multichannel video providers for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

  

 

 the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor in the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent through december 31 2014 our ability to continue to receive compensation from distributors as part of our retransmission consent negotiations may be adversely impacted by online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and its success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights for example there is ongoing litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of or compensation to nbc or its affiliates and the us supreme court has granted certiorari to hear the broadcasting industry’s challenge to one such entity if this practice is validated the fees multichannel video providers are willing to pay for our broadcast television content may be negatively impacted we also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercialskipping functionality in its dvr none of this litigation is final and the results as to the validity of these practices have been mixed to date additionally there is a pending legislative proposal that seems 

  

 

 intended to legitimize some of these practices there can be no assurance as to whether the courts will ultimately invalidate these practices or the pending legislation will be enacted or how any such rulings or legislation would ultimately affect our businesses 

piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see “business – legislation and regulation – other areas of regulation – intellectual property” above for additional information 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties equipment and data these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach we may provide certain confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced a few minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite these efforts there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

  

 

 we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent and cable communications’ employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us moreover many of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements a labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and resolution of disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our businesses could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as 

  

 

 the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if these risks occur our businesses may be adversely affected 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock which could be at a premium

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

 

we are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses comcast cable and nbcuniversal we present our operations for comcast cable in one reportable business segment referred to as cable communications and our operations for nbcuniversal in four reportable business segments 

cable communications segment 

comcast cable is the nation’s largest provider of video highspeed internet and voice services “cable services” to residential customers under the xfinity brand and we also provide similar services to small and mediumsized businesses as of december 31 2013 our cable systems served 217 million video customers 207 million highspeed internet customers and 107 million voice customers and passed more than 53 million homes and businesses our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services which we market individually and in packages and from the sale of advertising in 2013 our cable communications segment generated 65 of our consolidated revenue and 80 of our operating income before depreciation and amortization 

we offer a broad variety of video services with access to hundreds of channels including premium networks such as hbo showtime starz and cinemax payperview channels as well as on demand our videoondemand service and an interactive onscreen program guide our video customers may also subscribe to a higher level of video service including our hd video and dvr services our video customers have the ability to use xfinity tv online or our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets to view certain live television programming and some of our on demand content browse program listings and schedule and manage dvr recordings online 

our highspeed internet services generally provide internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 mbps and we also have introduced downstream speeds of up to 505 mbps in limited markets our highspeed internet service for business customers also includes a website hosting service and an interactive tool that allows customers to share coordinate and store documents online 

our voice services provide local and longdistance calling and other features for our business voice customers we also offer additional features such as hosted voice services that use cloud network servers a business directory listing and the added capacity for multiple phone lines 

in addition to the video highspeed internet and voice services that we offer to small and mediumsized business customers we offer ethernet network services to our mediumsized business customers that connect multiple locations we also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help our customers manage network bandwidth 

we also sell advertising under the spotlight brand that we receive through our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell to local regional and national advertisers 

the majority of our cable communications segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to our cable services customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts which typically have 2 to 5 year terms 

  

 

 the most significant operating cost for our cable communications segment is the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase we have and will continue to attempt to offset increases in programming expenses through rate increases the sale of additional video and other services and through operating efficiencies 

nbcuniversal segments 

nbcuniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops produces and distributes entertainment news and information sports and other content for global audiences the cable networks broadcast television filmed entertainment and theme parks segments comprise the nbcuniversal businesses and are collectively referred to as the “nbcuniversal segments”

 2013 developments 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2013 

 

  

 cable communications segment 

 

  

  

  

 nbcuniversal segments 

 

  

  

 redemption transaction 

on march 19 2013 comcast acquired ge’s remaining 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal holdings for approximately 167 billion the “redemption transaction” in addition to this transaction nbcuniversal purchased from ge certain properties nbcuniversal occupies at 30 rockefeller plaza in new york city and cnbc’s headquarters in englewood cliffs new jersey for 14 billion see note 4 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 

competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a 

  

 

 growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers additionally there continue to be new companies with significant financial resources that potentially may compete on a larger scale with our cable services as well as with our cable and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses 

competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers which have a national footprint and compete in all our service areas and phone companies which overlap approximately 45 of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiberbased networks we also compete with other providers of traditional cable services all of these companies typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal also must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating its businesses 

technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior newer services and devices that enable online digital distribution of movies television shows and other cable and broadcast video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance and evolve including some services that charge a nominal or no fee for such programming these services and devices may potentially negatively affect demand for our video services as well as demand for our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment content as the number of entertainment choices available to consumers increases and as video programming is more reliably delivered over the internet and more easily viewed via the internet on televisions wireless services and devices also continue to evolve allowing consumers to access information entertainment and communication services which could negatively impact demand for our cable services including for our voice services as people substitute mobile phones for landline phones in addition delayed viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of dvrs and similar products has increased and as content has become increasingly available via videoondemand services and internet sources which may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue 

in our cable communications segment we believe that adding more content and delivering it on an increasing variety of platforms will assist in attracting and retaining customers for our cable services we are also developing and launching new technology initiatives such as our x1 platform and deploying new wireless gateway devices to further enhance our video and highspeed internet services in our nbcuniversal segments to compete for consumers of our content and for customers at our theme parks we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in acquiring content and producing original content for our cable networks and broadcast television networks including the acquisition of sports rights and will continue to invest in our film productions and in the development of new theme park attractions see “business — competition” for additional information 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second calendar quarter and increased net customer additions in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels our us advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in evennumbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office 

  

 

 and issueoriented advertising our broadcast television revenue and operating costs and expenses are also cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of the olympic games and the super bowl our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts from increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees all of the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 london olympics and the 2012 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters and the release of our films on dvd and through digital distributors release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods

 segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 19 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 18 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation net income loss attributable to nbcuniversal net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap

  customer metrics 

 

 customer data includes residential and business customers 

cable communications segment – revenue 

our cable communications segment leverages our existing cable distribution system to grow revenue by among other things adding new customers encouraging existing cable customers to add new or higher tier services and growing other services such as our business services offerings and our home security and automation services we offer our cable services in bundles and often provide promotional incentives we seek to balance promotional offers and rate increases with their expected effects on the number of customers and overall revenue 

video 

video revenue increased 29 and 25 in 2013 and 2012 respectively increases in revenue of approximately 5 in both years were primarily related to customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service as well as from rate adjustments as of december 31 2013 124 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hdtv or dvr advanced services compared to 118 million customers and 109 million customers as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in both years the increases in revenue were partially offset by fewer residential video customers these decreases were primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas from phone and satellite competitors and the impact of rate adjustments we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers 

  

 

 as of december 31 2013 40 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 41 and 43 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

highspeed internet 

highspeed internet revenue increased 83 and 92 in 2013 and 2012 respectively increases in the number of residential customers accounted for increases in revenue of approximately 6 in both years the remaining increases in revenue in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to higher rates from customers receiving higher levels of service and rate adjustments 

as of december 31 2013 38 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 36 and 35 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our customer base continues to grow as consumers continue to choose our highspeed internet service and seek higher speed offerings 

voice 

voice revenue increased 28 and 15 in 2013 and 2012 respectively increases in the number of residential customers receiving our services through our discounted bundled offerings accounted for increases in revenue of approximately 6 and 4 in 2013 and 2012 respectively these increases were partially offset in both years by the impact of the allocation of voice revenue for our bundled customers because revenue attributable to voice services represents a lower proportion of the bundled rate the amounts allocated to voice revenue in the bundled rate have decreased in 2013 and 2012 because video and highspeed internet rates have increased while voice rates have remained relatively flat 

as of december 31 2013 20 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services compared to 19 and 18 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

business services 

business services revenue increased 264 and 313 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the increases in both years were primarily due to a higher number of business customers receiving our cable services the remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in the number of mediumsized business customers including those receiving our ethernet network and cellular backhaul services in 2013 our mediumsized business customers represented 19 of total business services revenue compared to 15 and 12 in 2012 and 2011 respectively we believe these increases in business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive products and pricing 

advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell to local regional and national advertisers under the spotlight brand in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also represent the advertising sales of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service 

advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions advertising revenue decreased 42 in 2013 primarily due to lower political advertising revenue excluding the impact of political advertising revenue in 2012 advertising revenue increased 48 primarily due to increases in the national and regional advertising markets advertising revenue increased 141 in 2012 primarily due to increases in political advertising revenue and improvements in the local and regional advertising markets which were primarily driven by increased spending from automotive advertisers 

  

 

 other 

we receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services cable franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our cable franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply 

other revenue increased 105 and 90 in 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily due to increases in franchise and other regulatory fees and in revenue from other services including our home security and automation services 

cable communications segment – operating costs and expenses

we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content including in hd to our video customers as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms including on demand online and through our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets and as the fees we pay increase primarily from sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers

in december 2013 the programs under which nbcuniversal monetized certain of its accounts receivable with a syndicate of banks were terminated the final payments of 14 billion associated with the termination of these programs are a component of net cash provided by operating activities in comcast’s and nbcuniversal’s consolidated statement of cash flows see note 17 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements and note 16 to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2013 compared to the changes in 2012 were primarily due to the timing of receipts for our accounts receivable increases in deferred revenue associated with our olympics broadcasts and a decrease in film and television costs the increases were partially offset by payments made in 2013 related to the termination of a film financing arrangement and payments of our accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors as well as the timing of other operating items 

the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2012 compared to the changes in 2011 were primarily related to a decrease in film and television costs partially offset by the settlement in 2012 of a 237 million liability associated with an unfavorable olympic contract that had been recorded through the application of acquisition accounting in 2011 as well as the timing of other operating items including accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses related to trade creditors 

interest payments remained relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease in interest payments in 2012 was primarily due to the repayment and redemption of certain of our debt obligations 

the increase in income tax payments in 2013 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations the net impact of the economic stimulus legislation the settlement of tax disputes and the repatriation of foreign earnings the increase in income tax payments in 2012 was primarily due to increases in taxable income which resulted in higher federal tax payments made in 2012 and the lower net benefit in 2012 of the economic stimulus legislation we expect income tax payments to increase in 2014 primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and the expiration of the economic stimulus legislation 

  

 

 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2013 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures acquisitions of real estate properties purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets net cash used in investing activities in 2012 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures cash paid for intangible assets and the purchase of investments and was substantially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments and return of capital from investees 

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 cable communications capital expenditures increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to an increase in customer premise equipment purchases including purchases related to our x1 platform and our wireless gateways in 2013 and increased investment in business services and network capacity 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 520 to 12 billion in 2013 primarily due to continued investment at our universal theme parks capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 757 to 763 million in 2012 primarily due to increased investment at our universal theme parks and increased investment in technical infrastructure to support our cable networks and broadcast television operations 

the rate of growth of our capital expenditures for 2014 is expected to increase as we continue to invest significantly in the deployment of our x1 platform and wireless gateways to our customers and the expansion of business services and our home security and automation services capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services and capacity for existing services in addition we have invested and expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks 

cash paid for intangible assets 

in 2013 and 2012 cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of software 

acquisitions of real estate properties 

in 2013 acquisitions of real estate properties included nbcuniversal’s purchases of the 30 rockefeller plaza properties it occupies in connection with the redemption transaction nbcuniversal’s purchase of the property located at 10 universal city plaza which is adjacent to universal studios in hollywood california and our purchase of an 80 interest in a business whose primary asset is our corporate headquarters located in philadelphia pennsylvania 

  

 

 acquisitions 

our 2013 and 2012 acquisitions were not significant in 2011 we closed the nbcuniversal transaction and nbcuniversal acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in universal orlando that it did not already own see note 4 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions 

proceeds from sales of businesses and investments 

in 2013 proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the redemption of our liberty media series a common stock by liberty media corporation and the sale of our investment in clearwire in 2012 proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the ae television networks transaction following the close of the ae television networks transaction nbcuniversal no longer receives dividends from ae television networks in 2012 and 2011 nbcuniversal received 129 million and 196 million respectively in dividends from ae television networks which were included in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 proceeds from sales of businesses and investments were primarily related to the sale of the philadelphia 76ers 

return of capital from investees 

in 2013 return of capital from investees consisted primarily of a distribution received from the weather channel holding corp “the weather channel” in 2012 return of capital from investees consisted primarily of distributions received from the spectrumco transaction our return of capital from investees in 2011 was not significant 

purchases of investments 

in 2013 purchases of investments related primarily to equity securities that were held as collateral for our prepaid forward sale agreements our purchases of investments in 2012 and 2011 were not significant 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of our acquisition of ge’s remaining 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal holdings repayments of debt repurchases of our common stock dividend payments and the effective settlement of our station venture liability which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and issuances of common stock proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

in january 2013 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 2850 senior notes due 2023 17 billion aggregate principal amount of 4250 senior notes due 2033 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4500 senior notes due 2043 in march 2013 in connection with the redemption transaction we consolidated an additional 4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by nbcuniversal enterprise and 125 billion of borrowings under the nbcuniversal enterprise credit facility 

during 2013 we repaid 23 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt outstanding at maturity 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions 

see note 9 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings and longterm debt incurred in connection with the redemption transaction including the debt issued by nbcuniversal enterprise which we now consolidate

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of december 31 2013 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights the accounting for film and television costs and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 8 5 and 15 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

  

 

 we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” 

for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

the annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

in 2013 we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights we considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment industry market and macroeconomic conditions and also the 27 increase in our market capitalization since we performed our 2012 quantitative assessment in addition we considered the results of our 2012 quantitative assessment in which the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 19 33 and 37 respectively we also compared our weighted average cost of capital in 2013 to that used in our 2012 quantitative assessment and it had remained relatively consistent based on our 2013 qualitative assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise rights were higher than our carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights 

film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period’s revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

  

 

 our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including home entertainment and other distribution platforms are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a series can be licensed for subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue in the case of television series and owned television programming revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

capitalized film and television costs as well as stage play production costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production falls below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of 167 million and 161 million were recorded in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately 

  

 

 resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period as of december 31 2013 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were 17 billion and 780 million respectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of comcast’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2013 to 835 from 915 nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of nbcuniversal’s total consolidated debt at fixed rates as of december 31 2013 to 932 from 999 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was to decrease comcast’s consolidated interest expense by 98 million 106 million and 136 million respectively the effect of nbcuniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to nbcuniversal’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on comcast’s interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2013 

 

 the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps in the table above includes 21 million related to nbcuniversal 

  

 

 we use the notional amount of each interest rate derivative financial instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the average implied forward libor through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2013 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2013 

certain of our financial contracts include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of comcast’s swaps could be subject to termination provisions if it does not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the estimated fair value of those swaps was not material the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time 

see note 2 to each of the comcast and nbcuniversal consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar value of our nonus revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations nbcuniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposures nbcuniversal enters into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy nbcuniversal hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 18 months in certain circumstances nbcuniversal enters into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of 18 months as of december 31 2013 and 2012 nbcuniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 968 million and 820 million respectively as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2013 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency for these assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar the analysis of such shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2013 income 

comcast is also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to its foreign currency denominated debt obligations crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was an asset of 73 million and 30 million respectively 

  

 

 equity price risk management 

 

comcast is exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of its investments in marketable securities comcast enters into various derivative transactions in accordance with its policies to manage the volatility related to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses comcast monitors its equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce its risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit comcast’s exposure to and the benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of its investments it uses equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value may include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments 

in 2013 and 2012 the changes in the fair value of the investments that comcast accounted for as availableforsale or trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments see note 6 to comcast’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on its investments and investment income loss net 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

comcast and nbcuniversal manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant comcast has agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties’ credit ratings as of december 31 2013 and 2012 comcast was not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements as of december 31 2013 the collateral that comcast held from certain of its counterparties under the terms of these agreements was not material

 advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on the cable networks that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service 

other revenue sources 

we receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees we also receive revenue related to our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other newer services such as our home security and automation services and expanded technical support services our cable franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue our home security and automation offering provides home monitoring services to our customers as well as the ability to manage other functions within the home such as lighting and climate control through xfinitynet or our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets

our video programming expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks and fees for retransmission of local broadcast television stations’ signals and by the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase

competition 

 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication entertainment and information products and services to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior for example companies continue to emerge that offer services and devices that enable digital distribution of movies television shows and other video programming and wireless services and devices continue to evolve moreover newer services that distribute video programming are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content these new alternative methods for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed and will continue to further increase the number of competitors we face 

  

 

 cable communications 

competition for the cable services we offer primarily includes direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers and phone companies these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for cable services that are comparable to the pricing and services we offer recently new video services and devices have emerged that offer digital distribution of movies television shows and other video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee for access the success of these new services could negatively impact the demand for our video services including for our dvr premium network on demand and streaming services moreover wireless technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks may compete with our video and highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as a result of wireless and internetbased phone services 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings see “legislation and regulation” below for additional information 

direct broadcast satellite providers 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to 34 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberopticbased networks that provide video and highspeed internet services in substantial portions of our service areas these and other phone companies also may market video services from dbs providers in certain areas where they provide only highspeed internet and phone services 

  

 

 other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and business subscribers 

other video competitors 

our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies such as 

 

  

  

  

 some of these competitors offer their services for free or charge a nominal fee for access to their content 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

  

 digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to 

  

 

 provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higherspeed services in many of our service areas the fcc has reduced the obligations of phone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of types of networks including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet networks which employ lte wimax and other technology standards and wifi networks some of these services are similar to ours these networks work with devices such as wireless data cards and wireless embedded devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers that connect to such embedded devices in addition a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks 

voice services 

our voice services compete against wireline phone companies including competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other voip service providers such as vonage certain phone companies such as att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling another carrier’s network we also compete with satellite operators who provide video offerings for businesses 

nbcuniversal segments 

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including cable broadcast and premium networks local broadcast television stations home entertainment payperview and videoondemand services online activities including digital distribution services and websites that provide social networking and usergenerated content and other forms of entertainment news and information 

our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks and local television stations the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks for distribution by multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties creative performing and technical personnel and with distributors for their content and consumer interest in their content 

  

 

 filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers as well as scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution of their content through various exhibition and distribution outlets and on digital media platforms 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities in order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure the investment required to introduce new attractions in our theme parks can be significant 

advertising 

our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – segment operating results – seasonality and cyclicality” for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses which are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities in addition our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the doj and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years after september 2011 in addition certain other aspects of the nbcuniversal consent decree are subject to oversight by a federal district court until at least 2013 legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses we are unable to predict any such changes or how any such changes will ultimately affect our businesses the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulations for further information 

  

 

 cable services 

 

video services 

program carriage 

the communications act and fcc regulations prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video providers from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc has adopted regulations that we believe increase the likelihood of program carriage complaints and is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us in july 2012 the fcc ruled against us in a program carriage complaint initiated by the tennis channel we have challenged that decision in court and were granted a stay of the fcc’s order pending the court’s review in addition the nbcuniversal order prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage and requires that if we place news andor business news channels in a channel lineup “neighborhood” we must place all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood bloomberg television filed a complaint at the fcc invoking this condition the fcc’s media bureau ruled substantially in favor of bloomberg but did not grant all of the relief bloomberg had requested both comcast and bloomberg have filed applications for review of the order by the full fcc we have been involved in other program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future adverse decisions in disputes under the program carriage regulations or nbcuniversal order conditions could negatively affect our business 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations alternatively local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station gives up its mustcarry right and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator such an agreement may involve payments to the station we have recently begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates as a result approximately 80 of our video services customers are not subject to rate regulation from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator while we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to 

  

 

 leased access to date the fcc has adopted regulations that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although their implementation has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the office of management and budget if implemented these regulations could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such regulations

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services with the exception of certain oneway devices like digital transport adapters these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result most settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard in addition the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets and other equipment that can connect directly to a cable system with a cablecard and receive oneway video services without the need for a settop box in addition cable operators must provide a credit to customers who use plugandplay equipment purchased at retail and allow them to selfinstall cablecards rather than having to arrange for professional installation the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued a decision in january 2013 vacating some of these cablecard rules the decision is not yet final and may be subject to further litigation if the court’s decision becomes final the fcc may attempt to readopt some or all of these rules and also consider proposals to supplant cablecards with another technology that would enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider system not just a cable system we are unable to predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our cable business 

federal and state legislators and regulators also are considering proposals to impose energy efficiency requirements on our settop boxes and certain network equipment although we other multichannel video providers and equipment manufacturers recently entered into a voluntary agreement taking steps to improve the energy efficiency of settop boxes we cannot predict what if any effect this agreement will have on potential energy efficiency regulations in addition the nbcuniversal order requires us to fulfill commitments designed to improve the parental control tools and information available to parents including providing navigation and blocking capabilities for certain settop boxes 

mdus and inside wiring 

fcc regulations prohibit exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus or other private residential real estate developments as well as our enforcement of exclusivity provisions in any of our preexisting access agreements fcc regulations also facilitate competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such properties 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards utility companies initiated a proceeding in 2009 at the fcc seeking to apply the telecommunications services pole rate formula to all pole attachments over which cable operators provide phone services using interconnected voip technology which is the type of technology we use for our voice services the pole attachment rates applicable to telecommunications services were significantly higher than the rates we currently pay in june 2011 the fcc adopted a pole rate formula that reduces the rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels that are at or near the rates for cable attachments but 

  

 

 utility companies are able to rebut certain presumptions in the new formula and it is expected that most will attempt to do so the fcc ruling is under review in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit 

vertical ownership limit 

the fcc is assessing whether to revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming channels that a cable operator may carry on a cable system the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels carried on a cable system was struck down by a federal appellate court in 2001 although the fcc continues to enforce it the fcc previously clarified that under the 40 limit cable systems with 75 or more channels must carry at least 45 unaffiliated channels our cable systems routinely carry more than 45 unaffiliated channels and we currently comply with the 40 limit compliance could become more difficult depending on what regulations if any the fcc adopts 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access “peg” programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the nbcuniversal order contains various pegrelated conditions including a requirement that we do not migrate peg channels to digital delivery on our cable system until the system has converted to alldigital distribution or until the government entity that is responsible for the system’s peg operations expressly agrees the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

fcc regulations establish franchising processes and obligations for new entrants that are different from those applicable to existing providers for example these regulations limit the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants and preempt certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the satellite television extension and localism act of 2010 “stela” made revisions to a cable operator’s compulsory copyright license to remove a number of uncertainties regarding the license’s operation in particular stela clarifies that in exchange for certain additional payments cable operators can limit the royalty calculation associated with retransmission of an outofmarket broadcast station to those cable subscribers who actually receive the outof market station the new law also clarifies that 

  

 

 cable operators must pay additional royalty fees for each digital multicast programming stream from an outof market broadcast station they retransmit that does not duplicate the content of the station’s primary stream it also establishes an audit mechanism for copyright owners to review a cable operator’s copyright royalty reporting practices which the copyright office has issued proposals to implement as required by stela the copyright office the gao and the fcc all issued reports to congress in 2011 that generally supported an eventual phaseout of the compulsory licenses although they also acknowledged the potential adverse impact on cable and satellite subscribers and the absence of any clear marketplace alternative to the compulsory licenses if adopted a phaseout plan could adversely affect our ability to obtain broadcast station programming and substantially increase our programming costs 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable distribution system in 2002 the fcc ruled that highspeed internet services such as ours are interstate information services that are not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

in 2010 the fcc adopted “open internet” regulations applicable to broadband internet service providers “isps” the regulations require broadband isps such as us to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service bar broadband isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and bar wireline broadband isps such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the noblocking and nondiscrimination requirements allow for reasonable network management the fcc has not prohibited speed tiers or usagebased pricing but has specifically noted that “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing its own content likely would violate these regulations these regulations are being challenged in federal court by a number of parties regardless of the outcome of that case the court’s decision will impact the fcc’s authority over broadband internet service and could result in more regulation that could adversely affect our business moreover under the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to comply with the open internet regulations regardless of whether they are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded in addition any internet service we provide regardless of whether it is accessed through a settop box gaming console or computer or other device must comply with the open internet regulations 

in addition the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas to continue to offer all of our highspeed internet service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to offer a new standalone 6 mbps downstream tier known as the performance starter tier at 4995 per month for three years to maintain a highspeed internet service of at least 12 mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to not discriminate in how we treat “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our highspeed internet service but not including our highspeed internet service video services or voice services we have taken a number of steps to comply with these conditions in 2012 after an fcc inquiry into whether we failed to comply with the standalone broadband condition we entered into a consent decree with the fcc to extend our offering of the performance starter tier for one additional year and to reinforce the promotion of our standalone broadband offerings including training our sales representatives with respect to these offerings 

  

 

 a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers the fcc issued an order in november 2011 that changed the way that a majority of universal service funds are allocated and began implementing that order in 2012 by focusing on broadband and wireless deployment and moving away from supporting traditional telephone service the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings while others could receive less funding the actual impact of the changes is not yet known the fcc’s ruling is under review in the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit 

in addition in november 2011 the fcc initiated a further rulemaking on ip interconnection issues which may have an impact on internet interconnection arrangements we have a number of peering and transit arrangements with other network operators and these arrangements historically have not been regulated by the fcc we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business 

in addition congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments also have adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service expanded copyright protection requirements taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

voice services 

we provide voice services by using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 law enforcement assistance calea outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligations and certain regulatory filing requirements but has not yet ruled on whether interconnected voip service should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the communications act the classification determination is important because telecommunications services are still regulated more pervasively than information services the regulatory environment for our voice services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip service state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services for example state commissions in vermont and new hampshire have issued orders finding that our voice services qualify as telecommunications services subject to state regulation although we have challenged both orders in court in some cases state legislation precludes state regulation of voipbased services notwithstanding how they are classified 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services the precise scope of interconnection regulations applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear in light of this uncertainty providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our affiliated clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our 

  

 

 right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in all of these challenges and no such challenges are currently pending that said if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted in december 2012 the fcc sought comment on two petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for ip voice providers and it also formed a task force to coordinate the fcc’s efforts on issues related to the transition of networks from circuitswitched to packetswitched technology including the issue of ip interconnection we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business in november 2011 the fcc issued an order clarifying the entire intercarrier compensation regime which governs the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic whether it be for local intrastate or interstate traffic or voip the fcc order affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers however the fcc’s order is currently under appeal with the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit 

other cable services regulations 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and voice services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

cable networks 

 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators other than terrestriallydelivered programming networks from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers such as dbs providers and phone companies that offer multichannel video programming services in addition the communications act and fcc regulations had limited the ability of cableaffiliated cable networks to offer exclusive programming contracts to a cable operator in october 2012 the fcc allowed a preemptive restriction on exclusive contracts to expire but reaffirmed that any such exclusive contract could be reviewed on a casebycase basis in response to a complaint alleging violation of the communications act’s prohibition against unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices that hinder significantly or prevent competitors from providing programming to customers this casebycase process already allowed multichannel video providers to file program access complaints to try to show that their lack of access to a terrestriallydelivered programming network had hindered significantly their ability to deliver video programming to subscribers in addition the fcc is considering proposals to establish presumptions that would make it easier for multichannel video providers to succeed with complaints involving exclusive contracts and to make it easier for them to use buying groups and for such buying groups to pursue complaints under the rules it is uncertain whether the fcc will act on these proposals and if adopted what impact these proposals would have on our cable networks 

the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2007 to consider whether companies that own multiple cable networks should be required to make each of their networks available to multichannel video providers on a standalone or “unbundled” basis when negotiating distribution agreements although it has not further acted on that 

  

 

 rulemaking we currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled and when requested on a standalone basis increased regulatory requirements imposed on the manner in which we negotiate programming distribution agreements with multichannel video providers may adversely affect our cable networks business 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree multichannel video providers can invoke commercial arbitration for program access pursuant to conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order against our cable networks and broadcast television networks including our regional sports networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability of and the terms and conditions of access to such programming for further discussion of these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” and “internet distribution” discussions within that section 

children’s programming 

the children’s television act “cta” and fcc regulations limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable networks broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age fcc regulations also limit the display during children’s programming on cable or broadcast of internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products similarly fcc regulations prohibit the display of commercials during children’s programming on cable or broadcast networks that use program characters to sell products when the commercial is adjacent to children’s programming in which the characters appear the fcc is currently considering whether to prohibit interactive advertising during children’s television programming the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children including commitments that we will not insert interactive advertising into children’s television programming in any of the advertising spots we control either as a multichannel video provider or as the programmer and that we will provide at least 15 million worth of public service announcements on childhood obesity fda nutritional guidelines digital literacy and parental controls per year until 2016 

broadcast television 

 

licensing 

the communications act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time and upon application may renew the licenses for additional terms under the communications act broadcast television licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations and there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse 

in addition cta and fcc regulations require that the fcc consider in its review of broadcast television station license renewals whether the station has served the educational and informational “ei” needs of children under the fcc’s regulations a station licensee will be deemed to have met its obligation to serve the ei needs of children if it has broadcast on its main program stream a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has a significant purpose of serving the ei needs of children under 17 years of age for broadcast television stations that multicast fcc regulations include a similar standard whereby the amount 

  

 

 of ei programming deemed to meet the station’s ei obligation increases in proportion to the amount of free multicast programming aired under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to provide an additional hour of ei programming per week on either the primary or multicast streams of our owned nbc local broadcast television stations and on the primary signal of our owned telemundo local broadcast television stations the fcc is considering whether the requirements for ei programming have been effective in promoting the availability of educational content for children on broadcast television and there can be no assurance that the fcc will not impose more stringent requirements 

under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to expand local news and information programming on our owned local television stations and to enter into cooperative arrangements with locally focused nonprofit news organizations in certain markets 

renewal applications are pending for a number of our broadcast television station licenses the fcc may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted a station’s authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review four pending applications have been formally opposed by third parties and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations’ programming the communications act also requires prior fcc approval for any sale of a broadcast station license whether through the assignment of the license and related assets from one company to another or the transfer of control of the stock or other equity of a company holding an fcc license third parties may oppose such applications the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals or that approvals in the future will contain acceptable fcc license conditions 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific levels in local television stations as well as other specified mass media entities such as limits on the crossownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc by law must review the ownership regulations detailed below once every four years and the most recent review was initiated in december 2011 “2011 media ownership notice” we cannot predict when the fcc’s current review will be completed or whether or how any of these regulations will change 

local television ownership 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the fcc and at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition further without regard to the number of remaining independentlyowned television stations the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same dma so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap the 2011 media ownership notice proposes minor modifications to the local television ownership rule it also raises questions regarding whether local newssharing agreements shared services agreements and joint sales agreements should count toward the fcc’s ownership limitations 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of television stations one entity may own or control nationally under the rule no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households our owned local television station reach does not exceed this limit 

  

 

 foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership ie through one or more subsidiaries although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest these limits have been held to apply to both voting control and equity as well as to ownership by any form of entity including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies 

dual network rule 

the dual network rule prohibits any of the four major broadcast television networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent federal law and fcc regulations also establish a mustcarryretransmission consent election regime for carriage of commercial television stations by satellite providers for the period beginning on january 1 2012 and ending on december 31 2014 all of the nbc network and telemundo network owned local television stations elected retransmission consent 

in enacting stela in 2010 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations stela expressly extended to january 1 2015 an existing prohibition against commercial television stations entering into exclusive retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video providers and also extended a requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith several other multichannel video providers and third parties filed a petition asking the fcc to initiate a rulemaking to consider changes to the current retransmission consent regulations and also asked congress to review the issue the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2011 that among other things seeks comment on proposals to modify the good faith negotiating standard and to eliminate regulations providing local television stations with exclusivity protections in their markets for network and syndicated programming legislation has been introduced that would eliminate both mustcarry and retransmission consent as well as more narrow legislation that would establish an arbitration mechanism to resolve impasses in retransmission consent negotiations we cannot predict what new laws or regulations if any may be adopted or how any such laws or regulations would affect our businesses in addition to potential remedies under the general retransmission consent regime multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration under rules established in the nbcuniversal order to resolve any disputes regarding carriage of any of our owned local broadcast television stations 

internet distribution 

under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding the availability and the terms and conditions of access to such programming in addition we are required to continue distributing programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute some programming in a similar fashion we are one of three broadcast network owners of hulu but were required to relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in hulu in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction if the two other broadcast network owners of hulu renew their agreements we must either continue to provide content to hulu on the terms in place as of january 2011 or enter into agreements on substantially the same terms as the broadcast network that provides the most economically favorable terms to hulu 

  

 

 broadcast spectrum 

in february 2012 congress authorized the fcc to conduct an incentive auction to reassign a portion of the broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use under the statute broadcasters may voluntarily relinquish some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the fcc’s auction of the spectrum to mobile broadband providers broadcasters that do not voluntarily relinquish their spectrum rights may still be affected as part of the process of clearing and repacking the spectrum for future mobile use but congress required the fcc to make “all reasonable efforts” to preserve broadcasters’ overtheair coverage area and population served and to reimburse those broadcasters’ reasonable costs the fcc currently is conducting a proceeding to implement this statute including establishing processes for how the spectrum will be repacked and how the broadcasters will be reimbursed for relocation costs we cannot predict whether or how any such regulations might affect our businesses 

indecency 

fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm broadcasters risk violating this prohibition because the vagueness of the relevant fcc definitions makes it difficult to apply moreover the fcc has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance” in contrast with its previous policy that had generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation the maximum penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is 325000 per indecent or profane utterance 

indecency regulation has been the subject of ongoing court review regarding both the fcc’s “fleeting expletives” policy and the fcc’s definition of what constitutes indecent material in june 2012 the us supreme court struck down the fcc’s assessment of indecency fines against abc and fox on the grounds that the agency failed to provide fair notice of its standards and enforcement policy however the court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the fcc’s indecency policy under the first amendment this ruling may result in the fcc’s clarification of its policy and future indecencyrelated enforcement actions from time to time we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local television stations included indecent or profane material increased content regulation particularly if it is vague and difficult to apply could have an adverse effect on our broadcast television business 

sponsorship identification 

federal legislation and fcc regulations provide that whenever a broadcast station transmits any programming for which it has received money service or other valuable consideration it must provide an accurate onair identification of the sponsor of the programming in 2008 the fcc commenced a proceeding to examine whether “embedded advertising” such as product placements and product integration in broadcast programming should be subject to stricter disclosure requirements and whether the sponsorship identification regulations should be extended to cable networks although the fcc has taken no action 

international regulation 

international regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes the regulation of programming and advertising for example the european union “eu” establishes minimum levels of regulation across all eu member states focused on content and advertising which also extends to nonlinear television services although eu countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas 

filmed entertainment 

 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures these laws substantially restrict the 

  

 

 licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and in certain instances also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors further under various consent judgments federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the united states including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theaterbytheater basis the federal trade commission “ftc” has called for stronger industry safeguards applicable to the marketing of violent movies to children 

in countries outside the united states there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products including film screen quotas television quotas regulation of content regulated contract terms product safety and labeling requirements discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of us products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and internetdomain laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as in the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations and we cannot predict with certainty what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

  

 

 privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the communications act and fcc regulations also provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services several states and numerous local jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws or franchise privacy provisions that apply to cable services 

the ftc has begun to exercise greater authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers in march 2012 the ftc staff issued a final report with guidelines for privacy limits in the collection and use of personal and profiling information even in the absence of demonstrated consumer harm in a february 2012 report the white house and commerce department also had suggested an expansion of privacy protections although with greater reliance on the development of enforceable industry codes legislation has also been introduced in congress that would regulate the use of personal and profiling information for advertising the ftc has encouraged the world wide web consortium to develop limits on the online collection and use of personal and profiling information in addition the ftc is reviewing its implementation of the children’s online privacy protection act “coppa” coppa imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under 13 years of age or that collect personal information or knowingly post personal information from children under 13 years of age the ftc has proposed certain changes to its coppa regulations that would expand the scope of the regulations we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately be adopted or how such requirements would affect our businesses 

we are also subject to state and federal regulations and laws regarding information security most of these regulations and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft substantially all of the us states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach in addition the ftc is applying the “red flag rules” which are designed to detect the warning signs of identity theft in the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 to both financial institutions and creditors we have established a compliance program as required under these rules legislation also has been introduced in congress that would impose new cybersecurity requirements on some critical networks and operations but the scope of such requirements if adopted has not yet been defined the white house is considering a similar executive order 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

advertising restrictions 

legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children we are unable to predict whether such reports will result in legislative proposals whether legislative proposals may be adopted or if adopted what impact they will have on our businesses 

  

 

 environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities we have been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of nbcuniversal’s current and former facilities and at offsite waste disposal locations although our share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material in addition the california attorney general and the alameda county california district attorney are investigating whether certain of our waste disposal policies procedures and practices are in violation of the california business and professions code and the california health and safety code these entities have not specified the relief that may be sought see item 3 legal proceedings in this part i for more information 

environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations we are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses 

disabilities access 

our businesses are subject to a number of requirements related to ensuring that our services are accessible to individuals with disabilities among other things our voice services and email services must be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities we must provide additional narrations of key visual elements referred to as “video description” on certain of our video services and programming and we must include closed captioning on certain video programming delivered to our customers congress has directed the fcc to adopt further accessibility requirements for multichannel video providers broadcasters and other entities over the next year and we cannot predict what impact those further requirements will have on our businesses 

other fcc regulations 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our businesses including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards loudness of commercial advertisements political advertising emergency alert system requirements equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable systems and television stations and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc regulations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we have approximately 129000 fulltime and parttime employees of these employees approximately 83000 were associated with our cable communications business and the remainder were associated with our nbcuniversal and other businesses we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

  

 

 caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance including as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements or as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication entertainment and information products and services to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable internet video streaming and downloading of video programming and wireless services and devices continue to evolve moreover in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors our ability to compete effectively also is in part dependent on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and governmental authorities 

while competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and phone companies we also directly compete against other providers of traditional cable services as well as other companies that offer programming and other communications services including highspeed internet and phone services to our customers and potential customers these companies typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services furthermore while we began offering verizon wireless’s products and services in addition to our cable services in certain of our service areas in 2012 some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities and may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition our cable communications business continues to seek ways to leverage our cable services network such as by increasing the speed of our highspeed internet services by expanding and enhancing our business services to mediumsized businesses and by launching additional services such as our home security and automation service there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communications revenue or to compete successfully in the future 

  

 

 each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses for example our cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home such as video games dvds and websites more recently nbcuniversal has begun competing for viewers with digital distribution services such as netflix and amazon some of which have their own highquality original content in addition our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers our filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for the production of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds it also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home our theme parks business also competes with other multipark entertainment companies 

in addition our cable communications business cable networks broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites 

for a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses see “business – competition” above there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our businesses 

we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment new technologies particularly alternative methods for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and that drive changes in consumer behavior these technologies may affect the demand for all of our products and services as the number of entertainment choices available to and the manner in which they are delivered to consumers continue to increase and evolve our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

newer services and technologies that may compete with our video services include digital distribution services and devices that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers as well as other devices such as smartphones and tablets some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content which could adversely affect the demand for our video services including for premium networks and our dvr on demand and streaming services in addition consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information entertainment and communication services outside the home and newer services in wireless internet technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such as wireless data cards tablets smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services are facing increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services the success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our cable communications’ competitive position business and results of operations 

new technologies also are affecting consumer behavior in ways that affect how content is viewed as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content which may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations for example the increased availability of dvrs videoondemand 

  

 

 services and cable broadcast and other video programming on the internet including highquality original video programming that may be viewed only through digital distribution services as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets which could adversely affect the demand for our video services the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay to nbcuniversal for its content and the levels of dvd and theatrical sales some of these newer technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within our programming which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive delayed viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of dvrs has increased and as content has become increasingly available via videoondemand services and internet sources these and other changes in technology distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our businesses 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms we incur increased programming expenses we have begun paying certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip voice service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases may adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations and our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses which could adversely affect our businesses for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses see “business – legislation and regulation” above 

  

 

 weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 

weak economic conditions in the united states and internationally including a weak us housing market persisted during 2012 a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions a continued or further decline in economic conditions or an increase in price levels generally due to inflationary pressures could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as internet video streaming or substitute services such as wireless internet devices and smartphones weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks’ programming and have reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and dvd releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending in our theme parks business weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us further any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms if these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate our businesses may be adversely affected 

a decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or by the economy in general any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings advertising sales and rates also are dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected by changes in audience measurement methodologies for example newer methods of viewing content such as delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content on computers tablets or smartphones might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less if any revenue than traditional distribution methods which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue further natural disasters wars acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty reductions in advertising expenditures could adversely affect our businesses 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content which is difficult to predict and its businesses may be adversely affected if its content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or our costs to create or acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable networks and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable networks and broadcast television networks in our films and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance 

  

 

 we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs moreover particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size and the timing and amount of our rights payments and there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our businesses may be adversely affected 

the loss of nbcuniversal’s programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect its businesses 

our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast television networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three years each of our owned local broadcast television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status in which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor in the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local broadcast television stations all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations have elected retransmission consent for the period january 1 2012 through december 31 2014 increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses 

our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage for example some companies are building fiberoptic networks that provide significant highspeed internet access speeds and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective costefficient or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected moreover changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

  

 

 we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties equipment and data these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach we may provide certain confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring has intensified in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempts to cause such systemsrelated events and security breaches and we have experienced a few minor systemsrelated events that to date have not resulted in any significant degradation or disruption to our network or information systems or our services or operations while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite these efforts there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future or not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our businesses could be adversely affected 

  

 

 in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and our success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content we create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising on our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of protecting our intellectual property rights piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states if any us or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase see “business – legislation and regulation – other areas of regulation – intellectual property” above for additional information 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected 

labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent and cable communications’ employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us moreover many of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements a labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and resolution of disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

  

 

 the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our business could be adversely affected 

sales of dvds have been declining 

several factors including weak economic conditions the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time are contributing to an industrywide decline in dvd sales both in the united states and internationally which has had an adverse effect on our filmed entertainment business’s results of operations dvd sales have also been adversely affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment such as videoondemand services which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales a continued decline in our dvd sales volumes could have an adverse effect primarily on our filmed entertainment business 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those referred to in “legal proceedings” and those arising in the ordinary course of business including regulatory and administrative proceedings claims and audits while we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financial condition an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be timeconsuming costly and injure our reputation further no assurance can be given that any unfavorable outcome would not have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our businesses worldwide there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including the current european debt crisis and other global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if these risks occur our businesses may be adversely affected 

  

 

 acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the ability to transfer potential effective control by selling the class b common stock

2012 consolidated operating results by segment 

 

 

 

 

consolidated revenue 

in 2012 our cable communications broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated revenue the increase in consolidated revenue in 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction and an increase in our cable communications segment revenue the nbcuniversal contributed businesses accounted for 145 billion of the increase in consolidated revenue in 2011 revenue for our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments is discussed separately below under the heading “segment operating results” 

  

 

 consolidated costs and expenses 

in 2012 our cable communications broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization consolidated “operating costs and expenses” the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction and the costs associated with the transaction as well as an increase in our cable communications segment the nbcuniversal contributed businesses accounted for 123 billion of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2011 operating costs and expenses for our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments are discussed separately below under the heading “segment operating results”

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

competition 

the results of operations of our reportable business segments may be affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior for example companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable digital distribution of movies television shows and other video programming and wireless services and devices continue to evolve moreover newer services that distribute video programming are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content this competition is further complicated by federal and state legislative bodies and various regulatory agencies such as the fcc which can adopt laws and policies that provide a favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors see “business – competition” for additional information 

  

 

 seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second calendar quarter and increased net customer additions in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels our us advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in evennumbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising our broadcast television revenue and operating costs and expenses also are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of the olympic games and the super bowl our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts from increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees all of the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2012 london olympics and the 2012 super bowl are reported in our broadcast television segment 

revenue in our filmed entertainment segment also fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters and the release of our films on dvd and through digital distributors revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments also fluctuates depending on the timing of the release of our programming on television and on dvd release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced during the summer months around holidays and in the fourth calendar quarter of each year revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations our theme parks experience peak attendance generally during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods

  customer metrics 

 

 customer data includes residential and business customers 

cable communications segment – revenue 

our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to 149 in 2012 from 138 in 2011 and 127 in 2010 the increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer were primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers receiving multiple services rate adjustments higher contributions from business services and declines in the total number of video customers 

video 

video revenue increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to rate adjustments and additional residential customers receiving higher levels of video service which were partially offset by declines in the number of residential video customers in both years during 2012 and 2011 the number of video customers decreased by 336000 and 459000 respectively these decreases were primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers 

as of december 31 2012 41 of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services compared to 43 and 44 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively as of december 31 2012 115 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd video or dvr services compared to 109 million customers and 101 million customers as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

business services 

our business services revenue is generated primarily from the internet voice and video services we offer to small and mediumsized business customers and from the sale to mediumsized businesses of our metro ethernet network services we also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators which help our customers manage continued growth in demand for network bandwidth 

business services revenue increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to increases in the number of business customers and our expansion of services to mediumsized business customers including metro ethernet network and cellular backhaul services 

advertising 

as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service 

advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the local advertising market and general economic conditions advertising revenue increased in 2012 due to increases in political advertising revenue and improvements in the local and regional advertising markets primarily driven by increased spending from automotive customers advertising revenue declined slightly in 2011 due to lower political advertising 

other 

we receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services cable franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our cable franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply 

cable communications segment – operating costs and expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margin which is our operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for 2012 2011 and 2010 was 410 411 and 404 respectively 

  

 

 programming expenses 

programming expenses our largest operating expense are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks and fees for retransmission of local broadcast television stations’ signals and by the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide programming expenses increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to increases in programming license fees and fees incurred to secure rights for additional programming for our customers 

we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content to our video customers including in hd and on demand as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms such as online and through our mobile apps for smartphones and tablets and as the fees charged to us increase programming expenses will also increase to the extent we improve the rate in which the number of our residential video customers decrease we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will assist in attracting and retaining video customers 

technical labor expenses 

technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor costs to complete service call and installation activities as well as network operations fulfillment and provisioning costs these expenses remained relatively flat in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to an increase in customer selfinstallation activities

the dvd market continues to experience declines due to the impact of weak economic conditions the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and increasing shifts in consumers toward subscription rental services discount rental kiosks and digital distributors which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales 

other 

we also generate revenue from producing and licensing live stage plays and distributing filmed entertainment produced by third parties other revenue decreased in 2012 and pro forma combined other revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower revenue generated from our stage plays as a result of fewer productions

headquarters and other operating costs and expenses incurred by our nbcuniversal businesses include overhead personnel costs and corporate initiatives as well as expenses related to the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011 operating costs and expenses remained flat in 2012 primarily due to higher technology and administrative costs offset by the impact of transactionrelated costs associated with the nbcuniversal transaction including severance and other compensationrelated costs in 2011 pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to these costs 

eliminations include the results of operations for universal orlando for the period january 29 2011 through june 30 2011 our theme parks segment included the results of operations of universal orlando for this period because these amounts had been reflected in our segment performance measure these amounts were not included when we measured total nbcuniversal and our consolidated results of operations because we recorded universal orlando as an equity method investment for the period january 29 2011 through june 30 2011

the components of investment income loss net for 2012 2011 and 2010 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of substantially all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and availableforsale securities the differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

 

 equity in net income losses of investees net 

the change in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2012 was primarily due to income of 876 million related to the spectrumco transaction see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information the change in equity in net income losses of investees net in 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of nbcuniversal and its equity method investments offset by losses related to our investment in clearwire llc 

other income expense net 

the change in other income expense net in 2012 was primarily due to a 1 billion gain related to the ae television networks transaction see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information other income expense net in 2012 and 2011 included 186 million and 57 million respectively of expenses related to fair value adjustments to contractual obligations that involve financial interests held by third parties in certain of our businesses the change in other income expense net in 2011 also included the impact of the absence of income in 2011 associated with the sale of one of our equity method investments and income related to the resolution of a contingency of an acquired company which were each recorded in 2010 

consolidated income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 323 372 and 399 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due the state income taxes uncertain tax positions and in 2012 and 2011 due to the partnership structure of nbcuniversal and foreign income taxes our effective income tax rate is impacted by nbcuniversal’s partnership structure in that our income tax expense includes taxes on only 51 of nbcuniversal’s pretax income in 2012 our effective income tax rate decreased due to proportionately higher pretax income at nbcuniversal which included nbcuniversal’s gain on the sale of its equity interest in ae television networks in addition our 2012 income tax expense decreased by 109 million and our 2011 income tax expense increased by 137 million due to certain changes in state tax laws that became effective in 2012 and 2011 respectively our income tax expense in the future may continue to be impacted by changes in nbcuniversal pretax income adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in tax laws we expect our 2013 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35 to 40 absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions 

consolidated net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

 

ge’s 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal holdings is recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements due to the redemption provisions outlined in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests includes ge’s allocated share of the earnings of nbcuniversal holdings and nbcuniversal the increase in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2012 was primarily due to ge’s allocated share of the increase in earnings of nbcuniversal during the current year the increase in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges as well as the acquisition of ge’s 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate that we will continue to use a sub 

  

 

 stantial portion of our cash flows to meet our debt repayment obligations to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities to return capital to shareholders and to fund the acquisition of ge’s 49 common equity interest in nbcuniversal 

as of december 31 2012 we held 11 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which 59 billion was attributable to nbcuniversal we also maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements in june 2012 comcast and comcast cable communications llc entered into a new 625 billion revolving credit facility due june 2017 with a syndicate of banks which may be used for general corporate purposes the new credit facility replaced our prior 68 billion credit facility that was terminated in connection with the execution of the new credit facility the interest rate on the new credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on comcast’s credit rating as of december 31 2012 the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” was 1125 the terms of the new credit facility’s financial covenants and guarantees are substantially the same as those under the prior credit facility as of december 31 2012 amounts available under the new credit facility and nbcuniversal’s credit facility net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and undrawn letters of credit was 58 billion and 14 billion respectively 

we and our cable communications subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing comcast’s public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing comcast’s and comcast cable communications’ credit facilities see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements nbcuniversal is subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing its public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing its credit facility we test for compliance with the covenants for each of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in each of our credit facilities pertains to leverage which is the ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2012 we and nbcuniversal each met this financial covenant by a significant margin neither we nor nbcuniversal expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant

nbcuniversal monetizes certain of its accounts receivable under programs with a syndicate of banks the effects of nbcuniversal’s monetization transactions are a component of net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

   

 

 the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2012 compared to the changes in 2011 were primarily related to a decrease in film and television costs partially offset by the settlement in 2012 of a 237 million liability associated with the unfavorable olympic contract that had been recorded through the application of acquisition accounting in 2011 as well as the timing of other operating items including accounts receivable and accounts payable related to trade creditors the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2011 compared to the changes in 2010 were primarily related to the timing of payments of operating items and payroll and an increase in film and television costs 

the decrease in interest payments in 2012 was primarily due to the repayment and redemption of certain of our debt obligations the increase in interest payments in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction 

the increase in income tax payments in 2012 was primarily due to increases in taxable income which resulted in higher federal tax payments made in 2012 and the lower net benefit in 2012 of the economic stimulus legislation the decrease in income tax payments in 2011 was primarily due to the net income tax benefit in 2011 of the 2010 economic stimulus legislation 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2012 consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures cash paid for intangible assets and the purchase of investments substantially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments and return of capital from investees net cash used in investing activities in 2011 and 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures and in 2011 the acquisitions of nbcuniversal and universal orlando 

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 cable communications capital expenditures increased in 2012 primarily due to an increase in equipment purchases and increased investment in business services and network capacity cable communications capital expenditures decreased slightly in 2011 primarily due to fewer equipment purchases and improved equipment pricing partially offset by increased investment in business services and network capacity 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 757 to 763 million in 2012 primarily due to increased investment at our universal theme parks and increased investment in technical infrastructure to support our cable networks and broadcast television operations capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments were not significant in 2011 

capital expenditures for 2013 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services and capacity for existing services in addition we have invested and expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks 

  

 

 cash paid for intangible assets

return of capital from investees 

in 2012 return of capital from investees consisted primarily of distributions received from the spectrumco transaction our return of capital from investees in 2011 and 2010 was not significant 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of repurchases of our common stock repayments of debt dividend payments repayments of our shortterm borrowings and nbcuniversal’s distributions to ge offset by proceeds from borrowings and issuances of common stock distributions in 2012 to ge as nbcuniversal’s noncontrolling member represented tax distributions and included 211 million related to the ae television networks transaction proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

during 2012 we issued 45 billion aggregate principal amount of debt of which 20 billion was issued by nbcuniversal during 2012 we repaid 781 million aggregate principal amount of our debt outstanding at maturity and we redeemed 21 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt outstanding prior to maturity

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of december 31 2012 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights the accounting for film and television costs and the accounting for income taxes are 

  

 

 critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below see notes 8 5 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements respectively for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

if we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights was less than the carrying amount we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the july 1 2012 annual impairment testing the table below illustrates the impairment related to our cable communications divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing 

percent hypothetical reduction in fair value and related impairment 

 

   

 

 film and television costs 

we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs including acquired libraries and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the film forecast computation method which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period’s actual revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including home entertainment and other distribution platforms are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a series can be licensed in subsequent platforms revenue estimates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue in the case of television series and owned television programming revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production five years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

capitalized film and television costs as well as stage play production costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a production falls below its unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production’s fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of 161 million and 57 million were recorded in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate 

  

 

 taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period as of december 31 2012 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were 16 billion and 721 million respectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates to 895 from 999 as of december 31 2012 in 2012 2011 and 2010 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of 106 million 136 million and 132 million respectively interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2012 

 

   

 

 we use the notional amount of each instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the average implied forward libor through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2012 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2012 

certain of our financial contracts include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of 13 million and 19 million respectively the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the united states and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar value of our nonus revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposures we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of our foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed one year in certain circumstances we enter into foreign exchange contracts with initial maturities in excess of one year as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of 820 million and 767 million respectively as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material 

we have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2012 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their relevant functional currency for these assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar the analysis of such shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2012 income 

we are also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to our foreign currency denominated debt obligations crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert fixedrate foreign currency denominated debt to fixedrate us dollar denominated debt in order to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was an asset of 30 million and a liability of 69 million respectively 

  

 

 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments 

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility related to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and the benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value may include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments 

except as described above in item 7 under the heading “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as availableforsale or trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investments 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties’ credit ratings as of december 31 2012 and 2011 neither we nor any of the counterparties were required to post collateral under the terms of the agreements

competition 

 

cable communications 

competition for the cable services we offer primarily includes direct broadcast satellite “dbs” providers and phone companies these competitors offer features pricing and packaging for cable services that are comparable to the pricing and services we offer recently new video services and devices have emerged that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee for access the success of these new services could negatively impact the demand for our video services including our dvr premium networks and on demand services moreover newer services in wireless technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services may compete with our cable and highspeed internet services and our voice services are facing increased competition as a result of wireless and internetbased phone services in addition technological advances and product innovations are increasing at a rapid pace and as a result the number of choices available to our customers is likely to increase thereby further intensifying competition 

  

 

 video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings see “legislation and regulation” below for additional information 

direct broadcast satellite providers 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to 34 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberopticbased networks in some cases using internet protocol technology that provide video and highspeed internet services in substantial portions of our service areas these and other phone companies also may market dbs video services in certain areas where they provide only highspeed internet and phone service 

other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

  

 

 satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer their subscribers both improved reception of local television broadcast stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to their residential and business subscribers 

other video competitors 

our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies such as 

 

  

  

  

 some of these competitors offer their services for free or charge a nominal fee for access to their content 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

 digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att verizon and centurylink have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higher speed services in many of our service areas the fcc has reduced the obligations of phone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of types of networks including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet networks which employ lte wimax and other technology standards and wifi networks these networks work with devices such as wireless data cards and wireless embedded devices such as smartphones laptops tablets and mobile wireless routers that connect to such embedded devices some of these services are similar to ours in addition a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks 

  

 

 voice services 

our voice services compete against wireline phone companies including competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other voip service providers such as skype certain phone companies such as att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

business services 

our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies including clecs these companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling another carrier’s network phone companies and clecs generally lack business cable television offerings in those situations we often compete with satellite operators 

advertising 

we compete for the sale of advertising with a wide variety of media including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional cable networks online and mobile outlets radio stations and print media 

nbcuniversal segments 

cable networks and broadcast television 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast and cable networks local television broadcast stations premium networks home entertainment payperview and video on demand services online activities including internet streaming and downloading and websites providing social networking and usergenerated content and other forms of entertainment news and information in addition our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for advertising revenue with other national and local media including other television networks television stations online and mobile outlets radio stations and print media 

our cable networks broadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for onair and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks and local television stations the market for programming is very competitive particularly for sports programming where the cost for such programming is significant 

our cable networks compete with other cable networks for distribution by multichannel video providers our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience 

in addition our cable and broadcast television production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties creative performing and technical personnel exhibition outlets and consumer interest in their products 

filmed entertainment 

our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and to a lesser extent with independent film producers as well as with alternative forms of entertainment our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce their distribution and marketing success and consumer response our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative performing and technical talent including writers actors directors and producers and 

  

 

 scripts for films our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution of their content through various exhibition and distribution outlets and on digital media platforms 

theme parks 

our theme parks business competes with other multipark entertainment companies we also compete with other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities in order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure the investment required to introduce new attractions in our theme parks can be significant 

seasonality and cyclicality 

 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – segment operating results – seasonality and cyclicality” for additional information 

legislation and regulation 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses which are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities in addition our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the doj and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration ranging from three to seven years in addition certain other aspects of the nbcuniversal consent decree are subject to oversight by a federal district court until at least 2013 legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations of existing statutes rules or regulations or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses we are unable to predict any such changes or how any such changes will ultimately affect our businesses the following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses although reference should be made to the communications act fcc regulations the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation for further information 

cable services 

 

video services 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates as a result approximately 80 of our video customers are not subject to rate regulation from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings as discussed under “legal proceedings” we and others are currently involved in litigation that could force us and other multichannel video providers to offer programming networks on an a la carte basis additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act 

  

 

 may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost 

program carriagelicense agreements 

the communications act and fcc regulations prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video providers from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc recently adopted regulations that we believe increase the likelihood of program carriage complaints and is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us in december 2011 an fcc administrative law judge ruled against us in a program carriage complaint initiated by the tennis channel we have challenged that decision at the fcc and if necessary will challenge the decision in court we have been involved in other program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future the nbcuniversal order also prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage under a standard that is comparable to existing law it also requires that if we place news andor business news channels in a channel lineup “neighborhood” we must place all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood bloomberg television has filed a complaint that attempts to invoke this condition adverse decisions in disputes under the program carriage regulations or nbcuniversal order conditions could negatively affect our business 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations alternatively local television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station gives up its mustcarry right and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator such an agreement may involve payment of compensation to the station we have recently begun paying certain local television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for direct monetary compensation and other concessions from local television stations 

now that broadcasters have completed their transition from analog to digital transmission cable operators generally are required to carry the primary digital programming stream of local broadcast stations as well as an analog version of the primary digital programming stream on systems that are not all digital these requirements are scheduled to last until june 12 2012 subject to possible extensions for information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator while we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access to date the fcc has adopted regulations that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although their implementation has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the office of management and budget if implemented these regulations could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such regulations 

  

 

 cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services with the exception of certain oneway devices like digital transport adapters these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result most settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard in addition the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets and other equipment that can connect directly to a cable system with a cablecard and receive oneway video services without the need for a settop box in addition cable operators must provide a credit to customers who use plugandplay equipment purchased at retail and allow them to selfinstall cablecards rather than having to arrange for professional installation the fcc also is considering proposals to supplant cablecards with another technology that would enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider system not just a cable system these proposals could impose substantial costs on us and impair our ability to innovate federal and state legislators and regulators also are considering proposals to impose energy efficiency requirements on our settop boxes and certain network equipment in addition the nbcuniversal order requires us to fulfill commitments designed to improve the parental control tools and information available to parents including providing navigation and blocking capabilities for certain settop boxes 

mdus and inside wiring 

fcc regulations prohibit exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus or other private residential real estate developments as well as our enforcement of exclusivity provisions in any of our preexisting access agreements fcc regulations also facilitate competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such properties 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards utility companies initiated a proceeding in 2009 at the fcc seeking to apply the telecommunications services pole rate formula to all pole attachments over which cable operators provide phone services using interconnected voip technology which is the type of technology we use for our voice services the pole attachment rates applicable to telecommunications services were significantly higher than the rates we currently pay in june 2011 the fcc adopted a pole rate formula that reduces the rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels that are at or near the rates for cable attachments but utility companies are able to rebut certain presumptions in the new formula and it is expected that most will attempt to do so a group of power utility companies has challenged that ruling in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit 

vertical ownership limit 

the fcc is assessing whether to revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming channels that a cable operator may carry on a cable system the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels carried on a cable system was struck down by a federal appellate court in 2001 although the fcc continues to enforce it the fcc previously clarified that under the 40 limit cable systems with 75 or more channels must carry at least 45 unaffiliated channels our cable systems routinely carry more than 45 unaffiliated channels and we currently comply with the 40 limit compliance could become more difficult depending on what regulations if any the fcc adopts 

  

 

 franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access “peg” programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the nbcuniversal order contains various pegrelated conditions including a requirement that we do not migrate peg channels to digital delivery on our cable system until the system has converted to alldigital distribution or until the government entity that is responsible for the system’s peg operations expressly agrees the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

fcc regulations establish franchising processes and obligations for new entrants that are different from those applicable to existing providers for example these regulations limit the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants and preempt certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the satellite television extension and localism act of 2010 “stela” made revisions to a cable operator’s compulsory copyright license to remove a number of uncertainties regarding the license’s operation in particular stela clarifies that in exchange for certain additional payments cable operators can limit the royalty calculation associated with retransmission of an outofmarket broadcast station to those cable subscribers who actually receive the outof market station the new law also clarifies that cable operators must pay additional royalty fees for each digital multicast programming stream from an outof market broadcast station they retransmit that does not duplicate the content of the station’s primary stream it also establishes an audit mechanism for copyright owners to review a cable operator’s copyright royalty reporting practices as required by stela the copyright office the gao and the fcc all issued reports to congress in 2011 that generally supported an eventual phase out of the compulsory licenses although they also acknowledged the potential adverse impact on cable and satellite subscribers and the absence of any clear marketplace alternative to the compulsory licenses if adopted a phaseout plan could adversely affect our ability to obtain broadcast station programming and substantially increase our programming costs 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable distribution system in 2002 the fcc ruled that highspeed internet services such as ours are interstate information services that are not subject to regulation as a 

  

 

 telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

the fcc has adopted socalled “open internet” regulations applicable to broadband internet service providers “isps” the regulations require broadband isps such as us to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service bar broadband isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and bar wireline broadband isps such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the noblocking and nondiscrimination requirements allow for reasonable network management the fcc has not prohibited speed tiers or usagebased pricing but has specifically noted that socalled “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing its own content likely would violate these regulations these regulations are being challenged in federal court by a number of parties however under the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to comply with the open internet regulations regardless of whether they are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded and they apply to any settop box we provide that enables a customer to receive broadband internet access service 

in addition the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas to continue to offer all of our highspeed internet service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices to offer a new standalone 6 megabits per second downstream service at 4995 per month for three years to maintain a highspeed internet service of at least 12 megabits per second downstream across most of our footprint and to not discriminate in how we treat socalled “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our highspeed internet service but not including our highspeed internet service video services or voice services over the course of 2011 we have taken a number of steps to comply with these conditions 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers in november 2011 the fcc issued an order that would substantially change the way that a majority of universal service funds are allocated by focusing on broadband deployment and moving away from supporting traditional telephone service the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings while others could receive less funding the actual impact is unknown because the funding cost allocation model has not yet been finalized by the fcc 

in addition in november 2011 the fcc initiated a further rulemaking on internet protocol interconnection issues which may have an impact on internet interconnection arrangements we have a number of peering and transit arrangements with other network operators and these arrangements historically have not been regulated by the fcc we cannot predict what if any proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business in addition congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments also have adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service expanded copyright protection requirements taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed inter 

  

 

 net service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

voice services 

we provide voice services by using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 calea and contributions to the universal service fund but has not yet ruled on the appropriate classification of voice services using interconnected voip technology the regulatory environment for our voice services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies voice services using interconnected voip technology for state and federal regulatory purposes state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services while more than 20 states have enacted legislation precluding regulation of voipbased service a few state public utility commissions are conducting proceedings that could lead to the imposition of state telephone regulations on our voice services for example state commissions in vermont and new hampshire have issued orders finding that our voice service qualifies as a telecommunications service subject to state regulation although we have challenged or intend to challenge both orders 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services the precise scope of phone company interconnection regulations applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear in light of this uncertainty providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in all of these challenges and no such challenges are currently pending that said if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted in november 2011 the fcc issued an order clarifying the entire intercarrier compensation regime which governs the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic whether it be for local intrastate or interstate traffic or voip the fcc order affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip providers however the fcc’s order is currently under appeal with the tenth circuit court of appeals 

other cable services regulations 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and voice services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

  

 

 cable networks 

 

program access 

the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators other than terrestriallydelivered programming networks from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers such as dbs providers and phone companies that offer multichannel video programming services and limit the ability of these cable networks to offer exclusive programming arrangements to affiliated cable operators this restriction is scheduled to end on october 5 2012 although the fcc will evaluate whether it should extend that date in addition fcc regulations allow multichannel video providers to file program access complaints to try to show that their lack of access to a terrestriallydelivered programming network has hindered significantly their ability to deliver video programming to subscribers regardless of whether the fcc decides to sunset the exclusivity prohibitions in 2012 we will be subject to program access obligations under the terms of the nbcuniversal order 

the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2007 to consider whether companies that own multiple cable networks should be required to make each of their networks available to multichannel video providers on a standalone or “unbundled” basis when negotiating distribution agreements although it has not further acted on that rulemaking we currently offer our cable networks on both a bundled and when requested on a standalone basis increased regulatory requirements imposed on the manner in which we negotiate programming distribution agreements with multichannel video providers may adversely affect our cable networks business 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order multichannel video providers can invoke commercial arbitration for program access pursuant to conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order against our cable networks including our regional sports and news networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability of and the terms and conditions of access to such programming for more information on these conditions see “broadcast television” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

children’s programming 

the children’s television act “cta” and fcc regulations limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable networks and broadcast networks during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age the fcc is currently considering whether to prohibit interactive advertising during children’s television programming the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children including commitments that we will not insert interactive advertising into children’s television programming in any of the advertising spots we control either as a multichannel video provider or as the programmer and that we will provide at least 15 million worth of public service announcements on childhood obesity fda nutritional guidelines digital literacy and parental controls per year until 2016 

broadcast television 

 

licensing 

the communications act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and upon application may renew the licenses for additional terms under the communications act television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast 

  

 

 licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations and there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse 

in addition cta and fcc regulations also require that the fcc consider in its review of broadcast television station license renewals whether the station has served the educational and informational “ei” needs of children under the fcc’s regulations a station licensee will be deemed to have met its obligation to serve the ei needs of children if it has broadcast on its main program stream a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has a significant purpose of serving the ei needs of children under 17 years of age for broadcast television stations that multicast fcc regulations include a similar standard whereby the amount of ei programming deemed to meet the station’s ei obligation increases in proportion to the amount of free multicast programming aired under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to provide an additional hour of ei programming per week on either the primary or multicast streams of our owned nbc affiliated local television stations and on the primary signal of our owned telemundo affiliated local television stations fcc regulations also limit the display during children’s programming of internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products the fcc is considering whether the requirements for ei programming have been effective in promoting the availability of educational content for children on broadcast television and there can be no assurance that the fcc will not impose more stringent requirements 

under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to expand local news and information programming on our owned local television stations and to enter into cooperative arrangements with locally focused nonprofit news organizations in certain markets 

renewal applications are pending for a number of our broadcast television station licenses the fcc may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted a station’s authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review three pending applications have been formally opposed by third parties and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations’ programming the communications act also requires prior fcc approval for any sale of a broadcast station license whether through the assignment of the license and related assets from one company to another or the transfer of control of the stock or other equity of a company holding an fcc license third parties may oppose such applications the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals or that approvals in the future will contain acceptable fcc license conditions 

ownership limits 

fcc regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific levels in local television stations as well as other specified mass media entities such as limits on the cross–ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market the fcc by law must review the ownership regulations detailed below once every four years and the most recent review was initiated in december 2011 “2011 media ownership notice” in addition there is pending litigation relating to regulations adopted in a prior review we cannot predict when the pending litigation or the fcc’s current review will be completed or whether or how any of these regulations will change 

local television ownership 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the 

  

 

 market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the fcc and at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition further without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same dma so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap the 2011 media ownership notice proposes minor modifications to the local television ownership rule it also raises questions regarding whether local newssharing agreements and shared services agreements should count toward the fcc’s ownership limitations 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the number of television stations one entity may own or control nationally under the rule no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households our owned local television station reach does not exceed this limit 

foreign ownership 

the communications act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership ie through one or more subsidiaries although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest these limits have been held to apply to both voting control and equity as well as to ownership by any form of entity including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies 

dual network rule 

the dual network rule prohibits any of the four major television broadcast networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every 3 years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent federal law and fcc regulations also establish a mustcarryretransmission consent election regime for carriage of commercial television stations by satellite providers through the period ending december 31 2011 all of the nbc network owned local television stations elected retransmission consent and the telemundo network owned local television stations elected mustcarry or retransmission consent depending on circumstances within their respective dmas for the period beginning on january 1 2012 and ending on december 31 2014 all of the nbc network and telemundo network owned local television stations elected retransmission consent 

in enacting stela in 2010 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations stela expressly extended to january 1 2015 an existing prohibition against commercial television stations entering into exclusive retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video providers and also extended a requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith several other multichannel video providers and third parties filed a petition asking the fcc to initiate a rulemaking to consider changes to the current retransmission consent regulations and also asked congress to review the issue the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2011 that among other things seeks comment on proposals to modify the good faith negotiating standard and to eliminate regulations providing local television stations with exclusivity protections in their markets for network and syndicated programming legislation has been introduced that would eliminate both mustcarry and retransmission consent as well as more narrow legislation that would establish an arbitration mechanism to resolve impasses in retransmission consent negotiations we cannot predict what new laws or regulations if any may be adopted or how any 

  

 

 such laws or regulations would affect our businesses in addition to potential remedies under the general retransmission consent regime multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration under rules established in the nbcuniversal order to resolve any disputes regarding carriage of any of our owned and operated television stations 

internet distribution 

under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration under conditions adopted in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability and the terms and conditions of access to such programming in addition we are required to continue distributing programming via nbccom that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute some programming in a similar fashion if the two other broadcast network owners of hulu renew their agreements we must either continue to provide content to hulu on the terms in place as of january 2011 or enter into agreements on substantially the same terms as the broadcast network that provides the most economically favorable terms to hulu 

broadcast spectrum 

the fcc’s national broadband plan recommends that as part of an fcc effort to make more spectrum available for mobile wireless broadband the fcc reallocate up to 120 mhz of spectrum from the broadcast television bands among other things it recommends updating television service area and distance separation regulations repacking current television station channel assignments as well as sharing frequencies and the reallocation of 120 mhz of spectrum from the broadcast television bands for broadband use 

the plan also urges congress to authorize incentive auctions to allow incumbents like broadcast television licensees to turn in spectrum rights and share in auction proceeds and calls for authority to assess spectrum fees on commercial fullpower local television stations bills have been introduced in congress that would authorize the fcc to conduct such incentive auctions and to share the proceeds with the broadcast licensees who relinquish their spectrum for such auctions but only to the extent such relinquishment is voluntary on the part of the broadcast licensee in november 2010 the fcc proposed to allow the sharing of television channels by multiple tv stations sought input on improving reception in the vhf band and proposed changes to allow fixed and mobile wireless broadband services in the broadcast television bands the fcc has emphasized that it does not intend to decrease broadcasters’ carriage rights and that it believes each sharing station will be licensed individually with the rights and obligations that accompany that license we cannot predict whether or how any such regulations or actions might affect our businesses 

indecency 

fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm broadcasters risk violating this prohibition because the vagueness of the relevant fcc definitions makes it difficult to apply moreover the fcc has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance” in contrast with its previous policy that had generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation the maximum penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is 325000 per indecent or profane utterance 

indecency regulation is the subject of ongoing court review regarding both the fcc’s “fleeting expletives” policy and the fcc’s definition of what constitutes indecent material the second circuit court of appeals ruled that the fcc’s indecency policy is unconstitutional because it is “impermissibly vague” although the ruling is now under review by the supreme court from time to time we have received and may receive in the 

  

 

 future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local television stations included indecent or profane material in addition some policymakers support the extension of indecency regulations to cable networks increased content regulation particularly if it is vague and difficult to apply could have an adverse effect on our broadcast and cable networks businesses 

sponsorship identification 

federal legislation and fcc regulations provide that whenever a broadcast station transmits any programming for which it has received money service or other valuable consideration it must provide an accurate onair identification of the sponsor of the programming the fcc is examining whether “embedded advertising” such as product placements and product integration in broadcast programming should be subject to stricter disclosure requirements and whether the sponsorship identification regulations should be extended to cable networks 

international regulation 

international regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes the regulation of programming and advertising for example the european union “eu” establishes minimum levels of regulation across all eu member states focused on content and advertising which also extends to nonlinear television services although eu countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas the majority of our european channels are under united kingdom jurisdiction and therefore subject to stricter regulation by its regulator 

filmed entertainment 

 

our filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of socalled “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures these laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and in certain instances also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors further under various consent judgments federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws our motion picture company is subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the united states including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theaterbytheater basis the federal trade commission “ftc” has called for stronger industry safeguards applicable to the marketing of violent movies to children 

in countries outside the united states there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products including film screen quotas television quotas regulation of content regulated contract terms product safety and labeling requirements discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of us products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements 

theme parks 

 

our theme parks are subject to various regulations including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses 

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and internetdomain laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents 

  

 

 challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights negatively impacting their value and further increasing the costs of enforcing our rights 

copyright laws also require that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems as well as the content we create the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations and we cannot predict with certainty what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the communications act and fcc regulations also provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services several states and numerous local jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws or franchise privacy provisions that apply to cable services 

the ftc has begun to exercise greater authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers in december 2010 the ftc staff issued a draft recommendation that privacy regulations should address consumer concerns over the collection and use of personal and profiling information even in the absence of demonstrated consumer harm in a december 2010 report the commerce department also suggested an expansion of privacy protections although with greater reliance on enforceable industry codes legislation has also been introduced in congress that would regulate the use of personal and profiling information for advertising in addition the ftc is reviewing its implementation of the children’s online privacy protection act “coppa” coppa imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under 13 years of age or that collect personal information or knowingly post personal information from children under 13 years of age the ftc has proposed certain changes to its coppa regulations that would expand the scope of the regulations 

we are also subject to state and federal regulations and laws regarding information security most of these regulations and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft substantially all of the us states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been 

  

 

 disclosed because of a security breach in addition the ftc is applying the “red flag rules” which are designed to detect the warning signs of identity theft in the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 to both financial institutions and creditors we have established a compliance program as required under these rules 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

advertising restrictions 

legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children we are unable to predict whether such reports will result in legislative proposals whether legislative proposals may be adopted or if adopted what impact they will have on our businesses 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities we have been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of nbcuniversal’s current and former facilities and at offsite waste disposal locations although our share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations we are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses 

disabilities access 

our businesses are subject to a number of requirements related to ensuring that our services are accessible to individuals with hearing and vision impairments among other things our voice services and email services must be accessible to persons with disabilities we must provide additional narrations of key visual elements referred to as “video description” on certain of our video services and programming and we must include closed captioning on certain video programming delivered to our customers 

other fcc regulations 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our businesses including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards loudness of commercial advertisements political advertising emergency alert system requirements equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable systems and television stations and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc regulations we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions 

  

 

 employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 126000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 85000 were associated with our cable communications business and the remainder were associated with our nbcuniversal and other businesses we also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of entertainment information and communication products and services to consumers moreover in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors 

while competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and phone companies we also directly compete against other providers of traditional cable services including smatv systems and companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities that we serve as well as other companies that offer programming and other communications services including highspeed internet and phone services to our customers and potential customers these companies typically offer features pricing and packaging for services comparable to our cable services furthermore we began offering verizon wireless’ products and services in addition to our cable services in certain of our service areas in 2012 some of our phone company competitors including verizon have their own wireless facilities which we do not have and have expanded or may expand their cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings which may adversely affect our business and results of operations technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape as companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video program 

  

 

 ming and as wireless services and devices continue to evolve in addition we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing cable services such as by enhancing our video services offerings by developing applications for and providing live television streaming on devices such as tablets and smartphones by increasing cross functionality among our services and by expanding our business services to mediumsized businesses there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow our cable communications business or to compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities we must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating these businesses for example our cable and broadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for viewers with other similar networks and stations as well as with other forms of entertainment and content available in the home such as video games dvds and websites more recently we have begun competing for viewers with services that provide internet video streaming and downloading of our competitors’ content and in some cases of the service’s own highquality original content they also compete for the sale of advertising time with other networks and stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites in addition our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers our filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for the production of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds and also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home our theme parks business also competes with other multipark entertainment companies for a more detailed description of the competition facing all of our businesses see “competition” above 

our ability to compete effectively also is in part dependent on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and governmental authorities there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies may adversely affect our competitive position business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment new technologies have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors we face and that drive changes in consumer behavior these technologies may affect the demand for all of our products and services as the number of entertainment choices available to and the manners in which they are delivered to consumers continue to increase our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and results of operations 

new services and technologies that may compete with our video services include online services and devices that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets and computers as well as other devices such as smartphones tablets and internetconnected televisions some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content which could adversely affect the demand for our video services including for our premium networks dvr and on demand services in addition consumers are increasingly interested in accessing information entertainment and communication services outside the home and newer services in wireless internet technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wifi networks and devices such 

  

 

 as wireless data cards tablets smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices may compete with our highspeed internet services our voice services are facing increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services the success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our cable communications’ competitive position business and results of operations 

new technologies also are affecting consumer behavior in ways that affect how content is viewed which may have a negative impact on nbcuniversal’s business and results of operations for example the increased availability of video on demand services dvrs and video programming on the internet including highquality original video programming that may be viewed only through internet streaming services as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets which could adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us the amount multichannel video providers are willing to pay for our content and the levels of dvd and theatrical sales some of these new technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within our programming which also may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive delayed viewing and advertising skipping have the potential to become more common as the penetration of dvrs increases and content becomes increasingly available via video on demand services and internet sources these and other changes in technology distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our competitive position businesses and results of operations 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers and through additional delivery platforms we incur increased programming expenses we have recently begun paying certain local television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for direct monetary compensation and other concessions from local television stations if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations moreover as our contracts with content providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip phone service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases may adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws our broadcast television business also is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations and our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses are subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations in addition as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction we are subject to the nbcuniversal 

  

 

 order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules regulations or interpretations thereof or prescribe new ones which may significantly affect our businesses any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses which could materially affect our results of operations for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses see “business – legislation and regulation” above 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

weak economic conditions in the united states and internationally including a weak us housing market persisted during 2011 a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions a continued or further decline in economic conditions or an increase in price levels generally due to inflationary pressures could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations for example customers may reduce the level of cable services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as video streaming over the internet or substitute services such as wireless internet devices and smartphones the weak economy negatively affected video services during 2011 weak economic conditions also may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that multichannel video providers pay for our cable networks’ programming and have reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases in our filmed entertainment business and attendance and spending for our theme parks business weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us further any disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms if these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

a decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our results of operations 

our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or by the economy in general any of which may cause advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings for our television programming changes in the advertising industry also could adversely affect the advertising revenue of our cable and broadcast networks for example we rely on nielsen ratings and nielsen’s audience measurement techniques to measure the popularity of our content a change in such measurement techniques or the introduction of new techniques could negatively impact the advertising revenue we generate further natural disasters wars acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty reductions in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations 

  

 

 nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content which is difficult to predict and our results of operations may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or our costs to acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create and acquire media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amounts in our content including in the production of original content on our cable and broadcast networks and for theme park attractions before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance in addition poor theatrical performance of a film may require us to reduce our estimate of revenue from that film which would accelerate the amortization of capitalized film costs and could result in a significant impairment charge we also obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content particularly for sports programming is intense and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs moreover particularly with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size and the timing and amount of our rights payments and there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our cost for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations may be adversely affected 

the loss of our programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

our cable networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local television stations in addition every three years each of our owned local television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status pursuant to which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor in the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local television stations all of our nbc and telemundo owned local television stations have elected retransmission consent for the period january 1 2012 through december 31 2014 increasingly our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses also have entered into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses and results of operations 

our business depends on keeping pace with technological developments 

our success is to a large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and the use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide our competitors 

  

 

 with a competitive advantage for example while we are beginning to employ ip technology in certain of our services some phone companies have been using ip technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly we expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective costefficient or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected moreover changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we make additional research and development expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our intellectual property such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal’s businesses and our success is highly dependent on protecting intellectual property rights in the content we create or acquire against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising on our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of protecting our intellectual property rights piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally that is intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights or a failure of the legal system to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights negatively impacting their value or increasing the costs of enforcing our rights see “business – legislation and regulation – other areas of regulation – intellectual property” above for additional information 

sales of dvds have been declining 

several factors including weak economic conditions the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time are contributing to an 

  

 

 industrywide decline in dvd sales both in the united states and internationally which has had an adverse effect on our filmed entertainment business’ results of operations dvd sales have also been adversely affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment such as video on demand services which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales a continued decline in our dvd sales volumes could have an adverse impact on our filmed entertainment business as well as on our cable networks and broadcast television businesses 

we rely on network and information systems and other technologies as well as key properties and a disruption cyber attack failure or destruction of such networks systems technologies or properties may disrupt our business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings cyber attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties equipment and data these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the risk of these systemsrelated events and security breaches occurring has intensified in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systemsrelated events and security breaches from occurring the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite these efforts there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future moreover we may provide certain confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information there is a risk that this information may be compromised 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on thirdparty vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected in which case our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

 

 labor disputes whether involving employees or sports organizations may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent and cable communications’ employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us moreover many of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements a labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and resolution of disputes may increase our costs there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable and broadcast networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb games labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse impact on our businesses cash flows and results of operations 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those referred to in “legal proceedings” and those arising in the ordinary course of business including regulatory and administrative proceedings claims and audits while we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financial condition an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be timeconsuming costly and injure our reputation further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in 2011 in addition to the nbcuniversal transaction we entered into agency agreements with verizon wireless providing among other things for verizon wireless’ sale of our cable services and our sale of verizon wireless’ products and services we also formed an innovation joint venture with verizon wireless and two other cable operators to develop technology to better integrate wireline and wireless products and services in connection with these and other acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business in addition our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses depend on the abilities and expertise of our onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our business could be adversely affected 

  

 

 we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 

our operation of businesses worldwide increased substantially as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including the current european debt crisis and other global financial market turmoil economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations and potentially adverse tax developments in addition doing business internationally is subject to risks relating to political or social unrest corruption and government regulation including us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations if these risks come to pass our businesses may be adversely affected 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts our chairman and ceo beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our company and the ability subject to certain restrictions through november 17 2012 to transfer potential effective control by selling the class b common stock

 nbcuniversal transaction 

on january 28 2011 we closed our transaction with ge to form a new company named nbcuniversal llc “nbcuniversal holdings” we now control and own 51 of nbcuniversal holdings and ge owns the remaining 49 as part of the nbcuniversal transaction ge contributed the businesses of nbcuniversal which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of nbcuniversal holdings the nbcuniversal businesses that were contributed included its national cable networks the nbc and telemundo broadcast networks and its nbc and telemundo owned local television stations universal pictures the universal studios hollywood theme park and other related assets we contributed our national cable networks our regional sports and news networks certain of our internet businesses including dailycandy and fandango and other related assets the “comcast content business” in addition to contributing the comcast content business to nbcuniversal we made a cash payment to ge of 62 billion which included transactionrelated costs we expect to receive tax benefits related to the transaction and have agreed to share with ge certain of these future tax benefits as they are realized 

we have incurred significant transaction costs directly related to the nbcuniversal transaction the incremental expenses related to legal accounting and valuation services and investment banking fees are reflected in operating costs and expenses we also incurred certain financing costs and other shared costs with ge associated with nbcuniversal debt facilities that were entered into in december 2009 and the issuance of nbcuniversal’s senior notes in 2010 which are included in other expense and interest expense in addition during 2011 nbcuniversal incurred transactionrelated costs associated with severance and other related compensation charges which are included in operating costs and expenses 

  

 

 the table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of income 

 

 because we now control nbcuniversal holdings we have applied acquisition accounting to the nbcuniversal contributed businesses and their results of operations are consolidated with our results following the acquisition the net assets of the nbcuniversal contributed businesses were recorded at their estimated fair value in valuing acquired assets and liabilities fair value estimates are based on but are not limited to future expected cash flows market rate assumptions for contractual obligations actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates the comcast content business continues at its historical or carryover basis 

consolidated operating results

2011 consolidated operating results 

 

 

 consolidated revenue 

the increase in consolidated revenue for 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction and an increase in our cable communications segment revenue the nbcuniversal contributed businesses accounted for 145 billion of the increase in consolidated revenue in 2010 our cable communications segment and our cable networks segment accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated revenue the remaining changes in consolidated revenue for both 2011 and 2010 related to our other business activities primarily comcast spectacor revenue for our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments are discussed separately under the heading “segment operating results” 

consolidated operating costs and expenses 

the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction and an increase in our cable communications segment the nbcuniversal contributed businesses accounted for 123 billion of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2010 our cable communications segment and our cable networks segment accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses the remaining changes in consolidated operating costs and expenses for both 2011 and 2010 related to our other business activities primarily comcast spectacor and costs associated with the nbcuniversal transaction operating costs and expenses for our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments are discussed separately under the heading “segment operating results” 

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

consolidated depreciation and amortization increased for 2011 primarily as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction for 2011 976 million of the increases in consolidated depreciation and amortization were related to the addition of the nbcuniversal contributed businesses including the impact of acquisition accounting adjustments as well as from the addition of universal orlando since july 2011 

depreciation expense for 2010 remained relatively stable primarily due to decreases in capital spending in recent years the increase in amortization expense for 2010 was primarily related to goodwill impairment charges taken in our cable networks segment totaling 76 million 

  

 

 segment operating results 

 

beginning in the first quarter of 2011 we changed our reporting segments as a result of the close of the nbcuniversal transaction we have recast our segment presentation for 2010 and 2009 to reflect our current operating segments 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

competition 

the results of operations of our reporting segments may be affected by competition as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment news and information content to consumers technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape as companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming and as wireless services and devices continue to evolve moreover newer services that distribute video programming are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content this competition is further complicated by federal and state legislative bodies and various regulatory agencies such as the fcc which can adopt laws and policies that provide a favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors see “business – competition” for additional information 

seasonality and cyclicality 

each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations in our cable communications segment our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets this generally results in weaker customer metrics in the second calendar quarter 

revenue in our cable communications cable networks and broadcast television segments are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels our us advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in evennumbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issueoriented advertising broadcast television revenue and operating costs and expenses also are 

  

 

 cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of the olympic games and super bowls our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts from increased demand for advertising time and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and amortization of the related rights fees our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted if the amount of advertising revenue generated does not exceed the associated costs of broadcasting such events 

revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing and performance of theatrical home entertainment and television releases release dates are determined by several factors including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods as a result revenue tends to be seasonal with increases experienced during the summer months around holidays and in the fourth calendar quarter of each year revenue in our cable networks broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees 

revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations our theme parks experience peak attendance generally during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods

 customer metrics

cable communications segment — revenue 

our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to 137 in 2011 from 127 in 2010 and 117 in 2009 the increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer were primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers receiving multiple services rate adjustments higher contributions from business services and declines in the total number of video customers 

video 

our video revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to rate adjustments and additional customers receiving higher levels of service offset by declines in the number of residential video customers in both years during 2011 and 2010 the number of video customers decreased by 460000 and 757000 respectively these decreases were primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas and weakness in the economy and in 2010 the loss of customers upon expiration of discounted promotions we expect further declines in the number of residential video customers during 2012 

during 2011 and 2010 we added or upgraded to our digital video service 816000 customers and 13 million customers respectively including those customers added or upgraded in 2010 in connection with our all digital conversion as of december 31 2011 43 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services as of december 31 2011 53 of our digital video customers subscribed to at least one of our advanced hdtv and dvr services

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with cable networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects in addition we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on xfinitycom and our on demand service 

advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the local advertising market and general economic conditions our advertising revenue declined slightly in 2011 due to lower political advertising our advertising revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to improvements in the overall television advertising market including political advertising 

business services 

our business services revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to increases in the number of customers across all cable services 

other 

we receive revenue related to franchise and other regulatory fees our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services our franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply

 customers and increase the number of delivery platforms such as online and through our mobile applications for smartphones and tablets and as fees for retransmission of broadcast networks increase 

technical labor expenses 

technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor costs to complete service call and installation activities as well as network operations fulfillment and provisioning costs these expenses remained relatively stable in 2011 and 2010 due to improvements in our service call metrics and decreases in customer activity 

customer service expenses 

customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling service calls and customer support customer service expenses remained relatively stable in 2011 customer service expenses decreased in 2010 primarily due to operating efficiencies and due to higher levels of activity in 2009 related to the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion

nbcuniversal segments overview 

 

the discussion below compares the nbcuniversal segments’ pro forma combined results for 2011 and 2010 as well as our cable networks segment actual results for 2010 and 2009 management believes reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the nbcuniversal segments for 2011 and 2010 is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of these segments for the current year our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the nbcuniversal and universal orlando transactions had occurred on january 1 2010 our pro forma data was also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and the elimination of costs and expenses directly related to the transactions but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the nbcuniversal contributed businesses or universal orlando since january 1 2010 nor of our future results

content licensing 

content licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the united states and internationally content licensing revenue depends on the length and terms of the initial network license for our owned programming consumer acceptance of our programming and our ability to subsequently license that programming to other networks both in the united states and internationally and to individual local us television stations in recent years the production and distribution costs related to our owned programming have exceeded the revenue generated from the initial network license by an increasing amount 

  

 

 the licensing of our owned television programming after the initial network licensing is critical to the financial success of a television series

sales of dvds have continued to decline several factors have contributed to the overall decline in the dvd market including weak economic conditions the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time dvd sales have also been negatively affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental services discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment such as video on demand services which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales 

other 

we also generate revenue from distributing third parties’ filmed entertainment producing stage plays publishing music and licensing consumer products 

our pro forma combined other revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to decreases in revenue generated from our stage plays as a result of fewer shows

we incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and in connection with the release of a film on other distribution platforms as a result we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition and may not realize profits if any until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue the costs of producing and marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future particularly if competition within the filmed entertainment industry continues to intensify 

pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses associated with promoting our 2011 theatrical releases

the components of investment income loss net for 2011 2010 and 2009 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of substantially all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and availableforsale securities the differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

 

 equity in net income losses of investees net 

the decrease in equity in net losses of investees net for 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of nbcuniversal and its equity method investments including ae television networks and the weather channel offset by losses related to our investment in clearwire llc 

other income expense net 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction we agreed to share with ge certain financing and other costs associated with debt facilities that were entered into in december 2009 and with the issuance of nbcuniversal’s senior notes in 2010 other income expense for 2011 and 2010 includes 16 million and 129 million respectively of expenses for our share of these costs other income expense for 2011 also includes 57 million of expenses related to contractual obligations involving perpetual financial interests held by third parties in certain of our businesses the obligations were recorded at fair value in connection with the nbcuniversal and universal orlando transactions with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in other income expense other income expense for 2010 also includes income of 141 million related to the sale of one of our equity method investments and income of 108 million related to recoveries in connection with the resolution of a contingency of an acquired company 

consolidated income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2011 2010 and 2009 was 372 399 and 289 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes interest on uncertain tax positions and in 2011 due to the partnership structure of nbcuniversal holdings and foreign income taxes our 2011 income tax expense was increased by 137 million due to certain changes in state tax laws our 2009 income tax expense was reduced by 566 million primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with settlements and adjustments of uncertain tax positions and related interest and certain subsidiary reorganizations that impacted deferred state income taxes our income tax expense may in the future continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in state tax laws we expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35 to 40 

consolidated net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

 

the increase in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal transaction ge’s interest in nbcuniversal holdings is recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements due to the redemption provisions outlined in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests includes ge’s allocated share of the earnings of nbcuniversal holdings and nbcuniversal 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges as well as potential future redemptions of ge’s noncontrolling equity interest in nbcuniversal through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing 

we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to meet our debt repayment obligations to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities and to return capital to shareholders the cash flows generated from our cable communications segment and other businesses are used to invest in their core businesses and return capital to shareholders the cash flows generated from 

  

 

 nbcuniversal are used to invest in its core businesses and to fund potential future redemptions of ge’s noncontrolling interest in nbcuniversal 

we maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper programs to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2011 65 billion was available under comcast’s and comcast cable communications’ revolving credit facilities and 934 million was available under nbcuniversal’s revolving credit facility 

we and our cable communications subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing comcast’s public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing comcast’s and comcast cable communications’ credit facilities see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements nbcuniversal is subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing its public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing its credit facility we test for compliance with the covenants for each of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in each of our credit facilities pertains to leverage ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2011 we and nbcuniversal each met this financial covenant by a significant margin neither we nor nbcuniversal expect to have to further reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant 

nbcuniversal transaction 

we made a cash payment of 62 billion to ge at the close of the nbcuniversal transaction we funded this payment with cash on hand and through the issuance of 650 million of commercial paper we also agreed to share with ge certain tax benefits as they are realized related to the form and structure of the transaction as of the close of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 we consolidated 91 billion of nbcuniversal senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041 we do not guarantee nbcuniversal’s debt obligations any future redemptions of ge’s stake in nbcuniversal holdings are expected to be funded primarily through nbcuniversal’s cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity if any borrowings by nbcuniversal to fund either of ge’s two potential redemptions would result in nbcuniversal exceeding a certain leverage ratio or losing investment grade status or if it cannot otherwise fund such redemptions we are committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two potential redemptions for an aggregate of up to 575 billion with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption to the extent nbcuniversal holdings cannot fund the redemptions 

universal orlando transaction 

on july 1 2011 nbcuniversal acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in universal orlando that it did not already own for 1 billion nbcuniversal funded this transaction with cash on hand borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a 250 million 1 year note due to us which was repaid in december 2011 borrowings under the nbcuniversal revolving credit facility along with cash on hand at universal orlando were used to terminate universal orlando’s existing 801 million term loan immediately following the acquisition 

receivables monetization 

nbcuniversal monetizes certain of its accounts receivable under programs with a syndicate of banks the effects of nbcuniversal’s monetization transactions are a component of net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

film financing 

in response to the high cost of producing films we have entered into film cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions these arrangements can take various 

  

 

 forms in most cases the form of the arrangement involves the grant of an economic interest in a film to a thirdparty investor investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film we account for our proceeds as a reduction to our capitalized film cost and the related cash flows are a component of net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 

 the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2011 and 2010 primarily relate to the timing of payments of operating items and payroll and in 2011 to an increase in film and television costs 

the increase in interest payments in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction the decrease in interest payments in 2010 was primarily due to the effects of early extinguishment costs associated with the repayment in 2009 of certain of our debt obligations prior to their maturity 

the decrease in income tax payments in 2011 was primarily due to the net income tax benefit in 2011 of the 2010 economic stimulus legislation the increase in income tax payments in 2010 was primarily due to increases in 2010 taxable income partially offset by tax payments made in 2009 that related to prior years 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures intangible assets and investments 

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment and we expect that this will continue in the future the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment from 2009 through 2011 

 

   

 

 cable communications capital expenditures decreased slightly in 2011 primarily due to fewer equipment purchases and improved equipment pricing partially offset by increased investment in business services and network capacity cable communications capital expenditures decreased 35 in 2010 primarily due to improved equipment pricing partially offset by increased investment in business services and strategic initiatives such as our all digital conversion and the continued deployment of docsis 30 wideband technology 

capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments were not significant in 2011 

capital expenditures for 2012 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services in addition we have invested and expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our theme parks 

cash paid for intangible assets 

in 2011 cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of software as well as payments associated with the acquisition of intellectual property rights for use in our theme parks 

acquisitions 

on january 28 2011 we closed the nbcuniversal transaction on july 1 2011 nbcuniversal acquired the remaining 50 equity interest in universal orlando that it did not already own our 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were not significant see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions 

proceeds from sales of businesses and investments 

in 2011 proceeds from sales of businesses and investments consisted primarily of the sale of the philadelphia 76ers nbcuniversal’s sale of a spanishlanguage local television station and other investments 

purchases of investments 

in 2011 we did not purchase any individually significant investments in 2010 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the purchase of an equity method investment in the houston regional sports network in 2009 purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in clearwire 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repayments of debt repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments offset by proceeds from borrowings net of repayments proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings 

share repurchases and dividends 

in 2011 we repurchased 95 million shares of our class a special common stock for 21 billion exhausting the then remaining availability under our share repurchase authorization in february 2012 our board of directors approved a 65 billion share repurchase authorization which does not have an expiration date under this authorization we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions we intend to repurchase 30 billion during 2012 subject to market conditions 

  

 

 our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling 12 billion in 2011 we paid dividends of 12 billion in 2011 in february 2012 our board of directors approved an increase of 44 to 065 per share on an annualized basis and approved the first quarterly dividend of 01625 per share to be paid in april 2012 we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors 

the table below sets forth information on our share repurchases and dividends paid in 2011 2010 and 2009

 ge redemption rights 

under the terms of the operating agreement of nbcuniversal holdings during the six month period beginning july 28 2014 ge has the right to cause nbcuniversal holdings to redeem in cash half of ge’s interest in nbcuniversal holdings and during the six month period beginning january 28 2018 ge has the right to cause nbcuniversal holdings to redeem ge’s remaining interest if any subject to various limitations we are committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two redemptions up to an aggregate of 575 billion to the extent nbcuniversal holdings cannot fund the redemptions with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption none of these amounts are included in the table above see “nbcuniversal transaction” under “introduction and overview” for additional details 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of december 31 2011 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction two additional areas have been identified as critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the two critical accounting judgments and estimates are associated with the accounting for film and television costs and the valuation of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

  

 

 valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and voice services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

if we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights was less than the carrying amount we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our cable communications divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the july 1 2011 annual impairment testing the table below illustrates the impairment related to our cable communications divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing 

percent hypothetical reduction in fair value and related impairment 

 

 

   

 

 income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period as of december 31 2011 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were 14 billion and 698 million respectively 

film and television costs 

as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction we capitalize film and television production costs including direct costs production overhead print costs development costs and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production costs as well as associated participation and residual payments using the ratio of the current period’s actual revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources “ultimate revenue” estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and therefore are updated regularly 

our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content as well as factors unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance as subsequent license revenue has historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance upon a film’s release our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets including home entertainment and other distribution platforms are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that a series can be licensed in subsequent platforms revenue esti 

  

 

 mates for these platforms such as us and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platforms are included in ultimate revenue in the case of television series and owned television programming revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production five years from the delivery of the most recent episode if later 

capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified if the fair value of a film or owned television programming falls below its unamortized cost we would recognize an impairment charge the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows which are supported by our internal forecasts 

fair value of acquisitionrelated assets and liabilities 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values in determining fair value management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain to assist in the estimation process thirdparty valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities 

our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of acquired assets and liabilities as well as asset lives have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for instance the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain of nbcuniversal’s assets and liabilities ge’s redeemable noncontrolling interest and the preliminary fair value of universal orlando’s assets and liabilities 

film and television costs 

film and television costs consist of our estimates of fair value for released films and television series completed not released theatrical films and television series and theatrical films inproduction and indevelopment released theatrical films and television series and completed not released theatrical films were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about the timing of cash flows television series theatrical films inproduction and indevelopment and acquired programming rights were valued using a replacement cost method 

investments 

the estimates of fair value for significant investments in nonpublic investees were determined using an income approach this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the investment and then involves adjusting the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams of the underlying business 

property and equipment 

the estimated fair value of acquired property and equipment was primarily determined using a market approach for land and a replacement cost approach for depreciable property and equipment the market approach for land assets represents a sales comparison that measures the value of an asset through an analysis of sales of comparable properties the replacement cost approach used for depreciable property and equipment measures the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets and adjusts for age and condition of the asset 

  

 

 intangible assets 

intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for customer relationships with advertisers and multichannel video providers each with an estimated useful life not to exceed 20 years and indefinitelived trade names and fcc licenses 

relationships with advertisers and multichannel video providers were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about future events including contract renewal estimates attrition and technology changes 

in determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finitelived intangibles we use the method and life that most closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset 

trade names were valued using the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

fcc licenses were valued using the greenfield method a form of the income approach this measure of fair value captures the future income potential assuming the license is used by a hypothetical startup operation 

guarantees and other obligations 

contractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows or market assumptions when available 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in nbcuniversal holdings is based on an income approach including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which may include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates to 871 from 985 as of december 31 2011 in 2011 2010 and 2009 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of approximately 136 million 132 million and 104 million respectively interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

  

 

 the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2011 

 

 we use the notional amount of each instrument to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts including accrued interest we estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate “libor” through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2011 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2011 

certain of our financial contracts include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of 19 million and 26 million respectively the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative financial instruments 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

nbcuniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the us and certain of nbcuniversal’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar these changes could adversely affect the us dollar value of our nonus revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content all of which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories 

as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposures we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of our foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses in accordance with our policy we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed one year in certain circumstances we may hedge a transaction not to exceed 18 months as of december 31 2011 we had foreign exchange contracts on a total notional value of 767 million as of december 31 2011 these foreign exchange contracts had an aggregate estimated fair value loss of 2 million 

  

 

 we have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to nbcuniversal’s operations as of december 31 2011 including our hedging contracts to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their relevant functional currency for these assets and liabilities we then evaluated the effects of a 10 shift in currency exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar the analysis of such shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2011 income 

we are also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to our foreign currency denominated debt obligations crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert fixed rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed rate us dollar denominated debt hedging the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the fair value of our crosscurrency swaps on our £625 million principal amount of 550 senior notes due 2029 was a liability of 69 million and 29 million respectively 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative financial instruments 

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and the benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value may include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments 

except as described above in item 7 under the heading “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as availableforsale or trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and note 6 and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investments and derivative financial instruments 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties’ credit ratings as of december 31 2011 and 2010 neither we nor any of the counterparties were required to post collateral under the terms of the agreements

our analog video services typically offer a limited basic service with access to between 20 and 40 channels of video programming in substantially all of our footprint we have converted our video services other than limited basic service exclusively to digital delivery which allows us to recapture bandwidth and expand our video offerings we refer to this as our all digital conversion our digital video services range from a digital economy service with access to approximately 50 channels of video programming to a full digital service with access to over 300 channels our video services

regional sports and news networks 

our regional sports and news networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet northwest portland comcast sports southwest houston comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco new england cable news boston comcast network philadelphia and comcast network midatlantic baltimorewashington these networks generate revenue from programming license agreements with multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising these networks were contributed to nbcuniversal at the close of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 

 

  

 

   

other revenue sources 

we also generate revenue from our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services 

sources of supply 

to offer our video services we license a substantial portion of our programming and the associated on demand offerings from broadcast and cable programming networks and we generally pay a monthly fee for such programming on a per video subscriber per channel basis we attempt to secure longterm programming licenses with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives from these programming networks we also license individual programs or packages of programs from programming suppliers for our on demand service and for viewing online generally under shorterterm agreements 

our video programming expenses depend on the number of our video customers the number of channels and programs we provide and the programming license fees we are charged we expect our video programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item and to continue to increase in the future 

we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of settop boxes and network equipment and services that we use in providing our cable services 

for our highspeed internet portal comcastnet we license software products such as email and security software and content such as news feeds from a variety of suppliers under contracts in which we generally pay on a fixedfee basis on a per subscriber basis in the case of software product licenses or on a video advertising revenue share basis in the case of content licenses 

to offer our phone services we license software products such as voice mail from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts the fees we pay generally are based on the consumption of the related services 

we use two vendors to provide our customer billing for our cable services 

customer and technical services 

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers call centers provide 247 callanswering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services group performs various tasks including installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

technology 

our cable distribution system employs a network architecture of hybrid fiber coax that we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable 

to support our future technology requirements this network allows the twoway delivery of transmissions which is essential to providing interactive video services such as on demand and highspeed internet and phone services 

we continue to work on technology initiatives including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 sales and marketing 

we offer our products and services directly to residential and business customers through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising television advertising internet advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets we also market our video highspeed internet and phone services individually and as bundled services 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment our cable services compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means competition for the cable services we offer 

 

  

 

   

primarily includes dbs operators and phone companies in 2010 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer in addition phone companies have continued to expand their service areas which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas these competitive factors have had an impact on and are likely to continue to negatively affect our results of operations in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment where the use of certain types of technology may provide our competitors with a competitive advantage and where new technologies are likely to increase the number of competitors we face for our cable services and our cable advertising business we expect advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to continue in the future and we are unable to predict what effects these developments may have on our businesses and operations 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete 

with our video service offerings furthermore the fcc and various state governments have adopted measures that reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including phone companies certain of these franchising entry measures have already been adopted in many states in which we operate we believe that we have been and continue to be disadvantaged as a result of these regulatory changes which apply less burdensome standards to certain types of our competitors see “legislation and regulation” below 

direct broadcast satellite systems 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to approximately 41 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 280 channels of programming including video services substantially similar to our video services two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

highpower satellite service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outdoor antennas satellite systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to dbs subscribers our digital video services are competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals currently delivered to subscribers by dbs providers 

federal law generally provides dbs providers with access to cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att and verizon have built and continue to build fiberopticbased networks to provide cable services similar to ours which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas in some areas this expansion has been accelerated by certain regulatory authorities adopting new rules designed to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new providers of video services and by some phone companies claiming that they can provide their video services without a local cable franchise see “legislation and regulation” below in some areas these phone companies also have marketing arrangements with dbs providers in which their highspeed internet and phone services are sold together with a dbs provider’s video services  

 

  

 

   

other wireline providers 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer customers both improved reception of local television broadcast stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and commercial developments 

other competitors 

our cable services also may compete to some degree for customers with other companies such as 

 

  

  

  

 highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  



digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higher speed services in many of our service areas the fcc has reduced the obligations of phone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of types of networks including 3g and 4g wireless highspeed data networks which employ lte wimax and other technology standards and wifi internet networks these networks work with devices such as wireless data cards and wireless embedded devices such as handsets laptops and tablets some of these services are similar to ours in addition a growing number of commercial venues such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi internet service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and other internet access networks 

phone services 

our phone services compete against wireline phone companies including competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other voip service providers certain phone companies such as att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

advertising 

we compete for the sale of advertising against a wide variety of media including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional cable programming networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and websites 

 

  

 

 programming segment 

 

as of december 31 2010 our programming segment consisted primarily of our consolidated national cable programming networks the businesses in our programming segment were contributed to nbcuniversal at the close of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 the table below presents a summary of our consolidated national cable programming networks 

 

  

  

revenue from our programming networks is primarily generated from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our programming networks the sale of advertising and the licensing of our programming internationally to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both our programming networks assist distributors with ongoing marketing and promotional activities to acquire and retain customers although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our programming networks by larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of such distributors could have a material adverse effect on our programming networks 

our programming networks often produce their own television programs and broadcasts of live events this often requires us to acquire the rights to the content that is used in such productions such as rights to screenplays or sporting events in other cases our programming networks license the cable telecast rights to television programs produced by third parties 

other businesses 

 

our other business interests include comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor comcast interactive media develops and operates our internet businesses focused on entertainment information and communication including comcastnet xfinity tv plaxo dailycandy and fandango dailycandy and fandango were contributed to nbcuniversal at the close of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 comcast spectacor owns two professional sports teams the philadelphia 76ers and the philadelphia flyers and a large multipurpose arena in philadelphia the wells fargo center and provides facilities management and food services for sporting events concerts and other events

advertising revenue in our cable and programming segments and nbcuniversal’s businesses is subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels us advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the 

 

  

 

   

spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season us advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in evennumbered years from advertising placed by candidates for political office and issueoriented advertising and from increased demand for advertising time in olympic broadcasts revenue also fluctuates due to the timing and performance of theatrical home entertainment and television releases and due to seasonal increases in theme park attendance 

legislation and regulation 

our businesses including nbcuniversal’s businesses are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities in addition our businesses are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc order approving the nbcuniversal transaction the “nbcuniversal order” and a consent decree entered into between us the department of justice and five states the “nbcuniversal consent decree” 

the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses including cable system and broadcast station ownership video services customer rates carriage of broadcast television stations broadcast programming content and advertising how we package our programming to customers and other providers access to cable system channels by franchising authorities and other parties the use of utility poles and conduits and our highspeed internet and phone services 

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statutes rules or interpretations of existing statutes or rules or prescribe new ones we are unable to predict any such changes or how any such changes will ultimately affect the regulation of our businesses in addition we always face the risk that congress or one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our businesses the following paragraphs describe existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements for our businesses including those of nbcuniversal 

nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by us and imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters among other things i we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration to 

determine what programming must be made available and the price terms and conditions that apply ii multichannel video programming distributors “mvpd” may invoke commercial arbitration to determine the price terms and conditions for access to our broadcast stations cable networks and regional sports networks iii we are prohibited from discriminating against cable programming networks on the basis of their nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage under a standard that is comparable to existing law iv we must comply with the fcc’s open internet rules regardless of whether these rules are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded and those rules will apply to any settop box we provide that enables a customer to receive highspeed internet services v we must satisfy various other conditions relating to our highspeed internet services including deploying broadband to certain unserved areas implementing a program to improve highspeed internet adoption among lowerincome households offering all our customers a “standalone” highspeed internet service and maintaining a highspeed internet service of at least 12 megabits per second across most of our footprint and vi we must renew our distribution agreement with hulu if the two other broadcast network owners of hulu also renew their agreements and we must relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in hulu these and other conditions and commitments relating to the nbcuniversal transaction are of varying duration ranging from three to seven years although we cannot predict how the conditions will be administered or what effects they will have on our businesses we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations the nbcuniversal consent decree is subject to a review process in federal district court whereby the court must determine whether entry of the consent decree is in the public interest

video services 

ownership limits 

we currently serve approximately 231 of the subscribers served by mvpds nationwide in august 2009 a federal appellate court struck down an fcc order that had established a 30 limit on the percentage of mvpd subscribers that any single cable operator could serve nationwide while there is currently no limit on the number of video subscribers that a single cable operator can serve nationwide the fcc may initiate consideration of a new limit however even without the adoption of a new limit federal regulators including the fcc and the federal trade commission “ftc” andor the department of justice could refuse to approve certain transactions that increase the number of video subscribers we serve 

the fcc is assessing whether to revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming channels that a cable operator may carry on a cable system the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels carried on a cable system was struck down by a federal 

 

  

 

   

appellate court in 2001 though the fcc continues to enforce it the fcc previously clarified that under the 40 limit cable systems with 75 or more channels must carry at least 45 unaffiliated channels our cable systems routinely carry more than 45 unaffiliated channels and as of the date of this annual report on form 10k comply with the 40 limit compliance could become more difficult depending on what rules if any the fcc adopts 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic video service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates as a result 74 of our video customers are not subject to rate regulation and as of december 31 2010 we have pending before the fcc additional petitions for determination of effective competition for systems covering another 4 of our video customers from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings as discussed under “legal proceedings” we and others are currently involved in litigation that could force us and other mvpds to offer programming networks on an a la carte basis additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost 

program carriagelicense agreements 

the communications act and fcc rules prohibit cable operators and other mvpds from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is considering proposals to expand its program carriage regulations the adoption of these proposals could have an adverse effect on our businesses the nbcuniversal order also prohibits discriminating against a network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage under a standard that is comparable to existing law and requires that if we carry news andor business news channels in a channel lineup “neighborhood” defined as placing a significant number or percentage of news andor business news channels substantially adjacent to one another in a system channel lineup we must carry all independent news and business news channels in that neighborhood we have been and currently are involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to program carriage complaints in the future adverse decisions in any such disputes could negatively affect our business in addition the nbcuniversal 

order requires us on a specified schedule over the next eight years to add ten new independently owned and operated channels to the digital tier of our cable systems 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations alternatively local television stations may choose to negotiate with a cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station gives up its mustcarry right and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator such an agreement may involve payment of compensation to the station we expect to be subject to increasing demands including demands for direct monetary compensation and other concessions by local television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our video services customers 

now that broadcasters have completed their transition from analog to digital transmission cable operators generally are required to carry the primary digital programming stream of local broadcast stations as well as an analog version of the primary digital programming stream on systems that are not all digital these requirements are scheduled to last until june 12 2012 subject to possible extensions for more information on mustcarry and retransmission consent issues relating to nbcuniversal’s broadcast businesses see “nbcuniversal’s broadcast networks and owned local television stations” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator while we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access to date the fcc has adopted rules that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although their implementation has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the office of management and budget if implemented these rules could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such rules 

cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services with the exception of certain oneway devices like the digital transport adapters we have been deploying as part of our all digital conversion these regulations prohibit cable operators from deploying new settop boxes that 

 

  

 

   

perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result most settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard which adds to the cost of settop boxes in addition the fcc has adopted rules aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets and other equipment that can connect directly to a cable distribution network system with a cablecard and receive oneway analog and digital video services without the need for a settop box in 2010 the fcc adopted additional cablecard regulations that among other things require cable operators to provide a credit to customers who use plugandplay equipment purchased at retail instead of the settop box included with an operator’s service package and allow customers with plugandplay equipment to selfinstall cablecards rather than having to arrange for a professional installation the fcc also is considering proposals to supplant cablecard with another technology that would enable retail video devices to work on any mvpd system not just a cable system these proposals could impose substantial costs on us and impair our ability to innovate in addition the nbcuniversal order requires us to fulfill commitments designed to improve the parental control tools and information available to parents including navigation and blocking upgrades to certain settop boxes 

mdus and inside wiring 

fcc rules prohibit exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus or other private real estate developments fcc rules also make unenforceable the exclusivity provisions of our preexisting access agreements and facilitate competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such mdus 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards the fcc or a state could increase pole attachment rates applicable to cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we could face materially higher pole attachment costs utility companies initiated a proceeding in 2009 at the fcc seeking to apply the telecommunications services pole rate to all poles over which cable operators provide phone services using interconnected voip technology which is the type of technology we use for our phone services however in may 2010 the fcc proposed to reduce the rate for telecommunications service pole attachments down to a level that is at or near the rate for cable attachments this proposal is pending 

  

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access “peg” programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the nbcuniversal order contains various pegrelated conditions including a requirement that we do not migrate peg channels to digital delivery on our cable system until the system has converted to alldigital distribution or until the government entity that is responsible for the system’s peg operations expressly agrees the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

fcc rules establish franchising processes and obligations for new entrants that are different from those applicable to existing providers for example these rules limit the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants and preempt certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise we believe that we have been and continue to be disadvantaged as a result of these rules and statutes 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the satellite television extension 

 

  

 

   

and localism act of 2010 “stela” made revisions to a cable operator’s compulsory copyright license to remove a number of uncertainties regarding the license’s operation in particular stela clarifies that in exchange for certain additional payments cable operators can limit the royalty calculation associated with retransmission of an outofmarket broadcast station to those cable subscribers who actually receive the outof market station the new law also clarifies that cable operators must pay additional royalty fees for each digital multicast programming stream from an outof market broadcast station they retransmit that does not duplicate the content of the station’s primary stream it also establishes an audit mechanism for copyright owners to review a cable operator’s copyright royalty reporting practices stela requires the preparation of several reports including a requirement that the register of copyrights in consultation with the fcc submit a report to congress by the end of august 2011 on proposals to phase out the compulsory copyright license for cable and satellite providers if adopted a phaseout plan could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs 

in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems the fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations and we cannot predict with certainty what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable distribution system in 2002 the fcc ruled that highspeed internet services such as ours are an interstate information service not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

the fcc has adopted socalled “open internet” rules that restrict or prohibit some types of commercial agreements between broadband internet service providers “isps” and providers of internet content or applications the regulations require broadband isps such as us to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial terms of the service bar broadband isps from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices and in particular bar wireline broadband isps such as us from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic the 

noblocking and nondiscrimination rules allow for reasonable network management the fcc has not prohibited speed tiers or usagebased pricing but has specifically noted that socalled “paid prioritization” ie charging content application and service providers for prioritizing their traffic over our lastmile facilities or an isp’s prioritizing its own content likely would violate these rules 

under the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to comply with the open internet rules regardless of whether these rules are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded and under the order those rules will apply to any settop box we provide that enables a customer to receive broadband internet access service in addition the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to deploy broadband to certain unserved areas implement a program to improve highspeed internet adoption among lowerincome households offer all of our highspeed internet service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable marketbased prices including offering a service of at least 6 megabits per second downstream at a price of 4995 monthly for 3 years maintain a highspeed internet service of at least 12 megabits per second downstream across most of our footprint and not discriminate in how we treat socalled “specialized services” defined as services we provide over the same lastmile facilities as our highspeed internet service but not including our highspeed internet service video services or phone services 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers congress and the fcc are considering proposals that could result in our highspeed internet services being subject to universal service fees and that could also result in subsidies being provided to our internet and video competitors we cannot predict whether or how such proposals will be adopted or if they are adopted how they will affect us 

in addition congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments have also adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

 

  

 

   

phone services 

we provide phone services by using interconnected voip technology the fcc has adopted a number of rules for providers of nontraditional phone services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 calea and contributions to the federal universal service fund but has not yet ruled on the appropriate classification of phone services using interconnected voip technology the regulatory environment for our phone services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies phone services using interconnected voip technology for state and federal regulatory purposes state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our phone services currently a few state public utility commissions are conducting proceedings that could lead to the imposition of state telephone regulations on our phone services for example state commissions in vermont and maine issued orders finding that our phone service qualifies as a telecommunications service subject to state regulation we are challenging both orders because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our phone services the precise scope of phone company interconnection rules applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not clear in light of this uncertainty providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in all of these challenges and no such challenges are currently pending if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide phone services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted similarly it is uncertain whether the fcc or congress will adopt further rules regarding interconnection rights and arrangements and how such rules would affect our phone services the entire methodology by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic whether it be for local intrastate or interstate traffic is under review at the fcc and in state commissions among the issues that could affect us are how much local exchange carriers should be allowed to charge for terminating long distance traffic and whether voip traffic should be treated differently from other kinds of exchanged traffic we could be adversely affected by the outcome of any of these proceedings if we are deemed liable to pay more or collect less than is our practice today the fcc is also considering industrywide reforms of intercarrier compensation that may eliminate or reduce such compensation although the impact on our phone services as a result of any such reforms is unclear 

other cable services regulations 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the cable services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and phone services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

disabilities access 

in october 2010 congress enacted the 21st century communications and video accessibility act this law gives the fcc the authority to adopt rules aimed at ensuring that persons with disabilities can access “advanced communications services” and internetdelivered video among other things the law directs the fcc to adopt regulations mandating accessibility to interconnected voip services such as the phone services we provide requiring that video programming delivered via internet protocol include closed captioning imposing video description rules on the top four broadcast networks and top five cable programming networks and requiring that mvpd program guides be accessible to the visually impaired this law and any regulations ultimately adopted by the fcc may impose substantial additional costs and obligations on our businesses 

cable programming networks 

 

program access 

the communications act and fcc rules generally prevent cable programming networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing mvpds such as dbs providers and phone companies that offer mvpd services and limit the ability of these cable programming networks to offer exclusive programming arrangements to affiliated cable operators the fcc’s sunset date for this restriction on exclusivity ends on october 5 2012 although the fcc will evaluate whether it should extend the sunset date beyond october 5 2012 and we cannot predict whether the fcc will further extend that date in addition in january 2010 the fcc adopted new rules that allow mvpds to file program access complaints to try to show that their lack of access to a terrestriallydelivered programming network has hindered significantly their ability to deliver video programming to subscribers another mvpd has appealed the new rules to a 

 

  

 

   

federal appeals court regardless of whether the fcc decides to sunset the exclusivity prohibitions in 2012 or whether the appeals court invalidates the new rules for terrestriallydelivered programming networks we will be subject to program access obligations under the terms of the nbcuniversal order 

the fcc launched a rulemaking in 2007 to consider whether companies that own multiple cable networks should be required to make each of their networks available on a standalone or “unbundled” basis when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds we currently offer our cable programming networks on a standalone basis increased regulatory requirements imposed on the manner in which our cable networks are provided to consumers or the manner in which we negotiate programming distribution agreements with mvpds may adversely affect our business 

under the terms of the nbcuniversal order mvpds can invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to rules established in the nbcuniversal order against our cable programming networks including our regional sports networks and our national and regional cable programming networks in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to rules established in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability of and the terms and conditions of access to such programming for more information on these conditions see “nbcuniversal’s broadcast networks and owned local television stations” below and refer to the “mustcarryretransmission consent” discussion within that section 

children’s programming 

the children’s television act “cta” and fcc rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable programming networks and broadcast networks during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age the fcc is currently considering whether to prohibit interactive advertising during children’s television programming the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children’s television and advertising directed at children including commitments that we will not insert interactive advertising into children’s television programming in any of the spots we control either as an mvpd or as the programmer and that we will provide at least 15 million worth of public service announcements on childhood obesity fda nutritional guidelines digital literacy and parental controls per year for each of the next five years 

nbcuniversal’s broadcast networks and owned local television stations 

 

licensing 

the communications act permits the operation of local broadcast television stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grants television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and upon application may renew the licenses for additional terms under the communications act television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that i the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity ii there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations and iii there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse 

in addition cta and fcc rules also require that the fcc consider in its review of broadcast television station license renewals whether the station has served the educational and informational “ei” needs of children under the fcc’s rules a station licensee will be deemed to have met its obligation to serve the ei needs of children if it has broadcast on its main program stream a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has a significant purpose of serving the ei needs of children under 17 years of age for broadcast television stations that multicast fcc rules include a similar standard whereby the amount of ei programming deemed to meet the station’s ei obligation increases in proportion to the amount of free multicast programming aired under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to provide an additional hour of ei programming per week on either the primary or multicast streams of our owned nbc affiliated local television stations and on the primary signal of our owned telemundo affiliated local television stations fcc rules also limit the display during children’s programming of internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products the fcc is considering whether the requirements for ei programming have been effective in promoting the availability of educational content for children on broadcast television and there can be no assurance that the fcc will not impose more stringent requirements 

the fcc imposes other regulations on the provision of programming by television stations there is a general obligation for television stations to serve the needs and interests of their local service area the fcc has had a proceeding open for several years considering the adoption of additional requirements for public service programming including possible quantitative requirements for news public affairs and other local service programming under the nbcuniversal order we have committed to expand local news and information programming on our owned 

 

  

 

   

local television stations and to enter into cooperative arrangements with locally focused nonprofit news organizations in certain markets the fcc also has specific requirements governing political advertising requiring among other things that broadcasters charge candidates the lowest unit rate charged to other advertisers for the same class of advertising time during the 45 days before a primary and the 60 days before a general election there have been proposals introduced in congress that could expand the discount given to candidates in certain circumstances 

renewal applications are pending for a number of nbcuniversal’s broadcast television station licenses the fcc may grant any license renewal application with or without conditions including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted a station’s authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is on file and under review three pending applications have been formally opposed by third parties and other applications are pending due to unresolved complaints of alleged indecency in the stations’ programming the communications act also requires prior fcc approval for any sale of a broadcast station license whether through the assignment of the license and related assets from one company to another or the transfer of control of the stock or other equity of a company holding an fcc license third parties may oppose such applications the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances although nbcuniversal has received such renewals and approvals in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals or that approvals in the future will contain acceptable fcc license conditions 

ownership limits 

fcc rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have “attributable interests” above specific levels in local television stations as well as other specified mass media entities the fcc by law must review the ownership rules detailed below once every four years the fcc began such a review in 2010 which likely will take several years to complete and there is pending litigation relating to these rules we cannot predict when the fcc’s current review will be completed or whether or how any of these rules will change 

local television ownership 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule a licensee may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same dma as long as i at least one of the two stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the fcc and ii at least eight independently owned and operating fullpower broadcast television stations remain in the market following the acquisition further without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same dma so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap until the closing of the nbcuniversal transaction 

nbcuniversal had owned three local television stations in the los angeles dma pursuant to a temporary waiver granted by the fcc we have placed one of those stations kwhytv into a divestiture trust until the station is sold to a third party on january 24 2011 nbcuniversal entered into an agreement to sell kwhytv to a third party the divesture trust and the third party filed an application on february 7 2011 seeking fcc consent to the sale of kwhytv 

national television ownership 

the communications act and fcc rules limit the number of television stations one entity may own or control nationally under the rule no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach in the aggregate more than 39 of all us television households nbcuniversal’s owned local television station reach does not exceed this limit 

foreign ownership 

the communications act limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20 direct ownership and 25 indirect ownership ie through one or more subsidiaries although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest these limits have been held to apply to both voting control and equity as well as to ownership by any form of entity including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies 

dual network rule 

the dual network rule prohibits any of the four major television broadcast networks abc cbs fox and nbc from being under common ownership or control with another of the four 

digital television 

all of nbcuniversal’s fullpower owned local television stations broadcast exclusively in digital format digital broadcasting permits a television station to offer a variety of services using its single 6 mhz channel such as highdefinition video programming multiple channels of video programming and data transmission subject to the requirement that each broadcaster must provide at least one free overtheair video program signal at least comparable in resolution to the station’s former analog programming transmissions 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

every three years each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its dma either mustcarry or retransmission consent through the period ending december 31 2011 all of the nbc network owned local television stations elected retransmission consent and the telemundo network owned local television stations elected mustcarry or retransmission consent depending on circumstances within each dma federal law and fcc regulations also establish a mustcarryretransmission consent election regime for carriage of commercial television stations by satellite providers through the period ending december 31 

 

  

 

   

2011 substantially all of the nbc network owned local television stations are being carried by the two major satellite providers pursuant to retransmission consent 

in enacting stela in 2010 congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations stela expressly extended to january 1 2015 an existing prohibition against commercial television stations entering into exclusive retransmission consent agreements with mvpds and also extended a requirement that commercial television stations and mvpds negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith we cannot predict whether the sunset date will be extended further whether additional changes will be made to the mustcarry and retransmission consent laws or whether any such changes would impact the delivery of our broadcast signals by mvpds several other mvpds and third parties filed a petition asking the fcc to initiate a rulemaking to consider changes to the current retransmission consent rules and also asked congress to review the issue the fcc has received public comment on the petition and announced plans to initiate a rulemaking in 2011 congress has held hearings on the matter legislation was recently introduced that would establish an arbitration mechanism to resolve breakdowns in retransmission consent negotiations we cannot predict what new laws or regulations if any may be adopted or how any such rules would affect our businesses in addition to potential remedies under the general retransmission consent regime under the nbcuniversal order mvpds may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to rules established in the nbcuniversal order to resolve any disputes regarding carriage of any of our owned and operated broadcast stations 

internet distribution 

under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration pursuant to rules established in the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree to resolve disputes regarding the availability and the terms and conditions of access to such programming in addition we are required to continue distributing via nbccom programming that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distribute via nbccom as of january 1 2011 on generally equivalent terms and conditions so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute some programming in a similar fashion we also are required to renew our distribution agreement with hulu if the other two broadcast network owners of hulu also renew their agreements and we must relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in hulu 

broadcast spectrum 

the fcc’s national broadband plan the “plan” recommends that as part of an fcc effort to make more spectrum available for mobile wireless broadband the fcc reallocate up to 120 mhz of spectrum from the broadcast television bands among other things the plan recommends updating television service area and distance separation rules repacking current television station channel assignments as well as sharing frequencies and the reallocation of 120 mhz of spectrum from the broadcast television bands for broadband use 

the plan urges congress to authorize incentive auctions to allow incumbents like broadcast television licensees to turn in spectrum rights and share in auction proceeds the plan also calls for authority to assess spectrum fees on commercial fullpower local television stations bills have been introduced in congress that would authorize the fcc to conduct such incentive auctions and to share the proceeds with the broadcast licensees who relinquish their spectrum for such auctions but only to the extent such relinquishment is voluntary on the part of the broadcast licensee in november 2010 the fcc proposed to allow the sharing of television channels by multiple tv stations sought input on improving reception in the vhf band and proposed changes to allow fixed and mobile wireless broadband services in the broadcast television bands the fcc has emphasized that it does not intend to decrease broadcasters’ carriage rights and that it believes each sharing station will be licensed individually with the rights and obligations that accompany that license we cannot predict whether congress or the fcc will adopt or implement any of the plan’s recommendations or the rule changes as proposed or how any such actions might affect our businesses 

indecency 

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm broadcasters risk violating this prohibition because the vagueness of the relevant fcc definitions makes it difficult to apply the maximum penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is 325000 per indecent or profane utterance 

indecency regulation is the subject of ongoing court review regarding both the fcc’s “fleeting expletives” policy and the fcc’s definition of what constitutes indecent material the second circuit court of appeals recently ruled that the fcc’s indecency policy is unconstitutional because it is “impermissibly vague” the fcc is considering asking the supreme court to review the case nbcuniversal from time to time has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the fcc prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its owned local television stations included indecent or profane material in addition some policymakers support the extension of indecency regulations to cable programming increased content regulation particularly if it is 

 

  

 

   

vague and difficult to apply could have an adverse effect on our cable programming and broadcast businesses 

sponsorship identification and advertising 

federal legislation and fcc rules provide that whenever a broadcast station transmits any programming for which it has received money service or other valuable consideration it must provide an accurate onair identification of the sponsor of the programming in a proceeding dating to june 2008 the fcc is examining whether “embedded advertising” such as product placements and product integration in broadcast programming should be subject to stricter disclosure requirements and whether the sponsorship identification rules should be extended to cable programming networks the adoption of some of these proposals could adversely affect our businesses 

the ftc guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials require that any material connection between the advertiser and the endorser that is not reasonably expected by the audience must be disclosed and that all claims made through endorsements be truthful and substantiated when made these requirements apply to traditional advertising as well as sponsored onair patter talk show discussions and blogs advertising practices inconsistent with these guides may result in enforcement action by the ftc typically against the advertiser andor the endorser although there is a possibility that a broadcaster may also face legal liability in certain cases 

international regulation 

international regulation of television broadcasting varies widely according to jurisdiction and includes regulation of such areas as programming and advertising in the european union “eu” the audio visual media services directive establishes minimum levels of regulation across all eu member states focused on content and advertising this directive extends regulation to nonlinear television services establishes a “country of origin principle” which determines the relevant regulatory jurisdiction for each service and sets quotas where practicable for european programming and programming by independent producers eu countries are free to impose stricter regulation in certain areas and have taken different approaches to imposing such quotas the majority of our european channels are under united kingdom jurisdiction as the country of origin and therefore subject to regulation by its regulator changes to implementation of the country of origin principle or quotas could adversely affect our international television broadcast business 

filmed entertainment 

 

united states 

nbcuniversal’s filmed entertainment business is subject to the provisions of socalled “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and puerto rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures these laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and in certain instances also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors further under various consent judgments federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition laws nbcuniversal’s motion picture company and certain other motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on trade practices in the united states including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theaterbytheater basis in december 2009 the ftc issued a report calling for stronger industry safeguards applicable to the marketing of violent movies to children and concluding that movie studios intentionally market pg13 movies to children under 13 and that unrated dvds undermine the motion picture academy of america’s rating system and confuse parents the ftc has not called for regulation or enforcement against movie studios but any such government action in this area could have a negative impact on nbcuniversal’s filmed entertainment business 

international 

in countries outside the united states there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect nbcuniversal’s ability to distribute andor license motion picture and television products as well as consumer merchandise products including copyright laws and regulations that may or may not be adequate to protect its interests film screen quotas television quotas regulation of content regulated contract terms product safety and labeling requirements discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of us products the ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements including the world trade organization’s general agreement on tariffs and trade and general agreement on trade and services however these agreements have limited application with respect to preventing the denial of market access to audiovisual products originating outside the european union 

theme parks 

 

nbcuniversal’s theme parks business is subject to regulation at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection privacy and data protection consumer product safety and theme park operations such as health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses 

 

  

 

   

other areas of regulation 

 

intellectual property and piracy 

copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and internetdomain laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit dvds peertopeer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable programming broadcast and filmed entertainment businesses the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material over the internet or through other methods of distribution such as through devices software or websites that allow the reproduction viewing sharing andor downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content’s security features and copyrighted status interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections such as encryption are controversial modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming 

in october 2008 the prioritizing resources and organization for intellectual property act of 2007 the “proip act” was signed into law in the united states the proip act increases both civil and criminal penalties for counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property associated with works of music and film among others provides enhanced resources to law enforcement agencies for enforcing intellectual property rights criminalizes the exportation of counterfeited goods and creates an “intellectual property enforcement coordinator” a senateconfirmed presidential appointee responsible for developing governmentwide enforcement policy coordinating the enforcement efforts of us departments and agencies and coordinating the preparation of a plan to reduce counterfeit and infringing goods in the us and international supply chain in september 2010 the combating online infringement and counterfeits act was introduced by the senate judiciary committee the bill would give the department of justice the power to shut down websites found to be offering infringing content by requiring domain name registrars to suspend the domain names of the offending sites and taking other actions to prevent third parties from providing certain services to such sites 

while many legal protections exist to combat piracy laws in the united states and internationally continue to evolve as do technologies used to evade these laws nbcuniversal has actively engaged in the enforcement of its intellectual property rights and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content the repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

negatively impacting their value and further increasing the costs of enforcing our rights 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit such collection and disclosure for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the communications act also provides privacy protections for customer proprietary network information or cpni related to our digital phone services several states and the district of columbia have enacted privacy laws that apply to cable services 

the ftc has begun to exercise greater authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers in december 2010 the ftc staff issued a draft recommendation that privacy rules should address consumer concerns over the collection and use of personal and profiling information even in the absence of demonstrated consumer harm in a december 2010 report the commerce department also suggested an expansion of privacy protections although with greater reliance on enforceable industry codes legislation has also been introduced in congress that would regulate the use of personal and profiling information for advertising in addition the ftc is reviewing its implementation of the children’s online privacy protection act “coppa” coppa imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under 13 years of age that collect personal information from children under 13 years of age or that knowingly post personal information from children under 13 years of age the ftc is considering whether to expand the reach of its coppa rules to interactive tv and online behavioral advertising such changes if adopted could have an adverse impact on our businesses to the extent our networks and websites offer content targeted to children and teens 

we are also subject to state and federal rules and laws regarding information security most of these rules and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft substantially all of the us states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach the ftc is applying the “red flag rules” in the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 to both financial institutions and creditors and we may be considered to be a creditor under the ftc’s interpretation of the rules 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited 

 

  

 

   

commercial emails additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

advertising restrictions 

legislation has been introduced and reports from various government agencies have been issued from time to time urging that restrictions be placed on advertisements for particular products or services including prescription drugs and the marketing of food or violent entertainment to children we are unable to predict whether such reports will result in legislative proposals whether legislative proposals may be adopted or if adopted what impact they will have on our businesses 

environmental matters 

certain of our business operations are subject to local state and federal environmental laws and regulations and involve air emissions wastewater discharges and the use disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims or other costs or liabilities nbcuniversal has been responsible for the cleanup of environmental contamination at some of its current and former facilities and at offsite waste disposal locations although its share of the cost of such cleanups to date has not been material environmental requirements have become more stringent over time and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs for example climate change regulation such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs could result in an increase in the cost of electricity which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations we are unable to accurately predict how these requirements might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses 

other fcc regulations 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our businesses including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards political advertising emergency alert system requirements for analog and digital services origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable network and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc rules we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 102000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 86000 were associated with our cable business and the remainder were associated with our programming and other businesses as of december 31 2010 approximately 4000 of our employees including parttime employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or had organized but were not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance including as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that these statements are only our predictions in evaluating these statements you should consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “risk factors” and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements or as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 

 

  

 

   




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses currently face a wide range of competition and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of news and entertainment programming and information and communication services to consumers 

while competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and phone companies we also directly compete against other providers of traditional cable services including companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities that we serve and smatv systems as well as other companies that offer programming and other communications services including highspeed internet and phone services to our customers and potential customers recently companies have emerged that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming some of which charge a nominal or no fee for access phone companies have expanded their service areas in recent years which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless phone facilities which we do not have and have expanded or may expand their cable service offerings to include wireless offerings which may adversely affect our growth business and results of operations in addition in 2010 dbs operators and phone companies continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the cable services we offer in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors in addition while we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing cable products and services such as by employing addressable advertising and offering our cable services to business customers there can be no assurance that we can execute on these enhancements or expansions in a manner sufficient to grow our businesses or compete successfully in the future 

each of nbcuniversal’s businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from alternative providers of similar types of content as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities we must compete to obtain talent programming and other resources required in operating nbcuniversal’s businesses for example our cable programming and broadcast networks and owned local television stations compete for viewers with other cable networks broadcast networks and television stations as well as with other forms of content available in the home such as video games dvds and websites and they also compete for the sale of advertising time with other cable networks broad 

cast networks and television stations as well as with all other advertising platforms such as radio stations print media and websites in addition our cable programming networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by mvpds nbcuniversal’s filmed entertainment business competes with other film studios and independent producers for sources of financing for the production of its films for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for shelf space in retail stores for its dvds and also competes for consumers with other film producers and distributors and all other forms of entertainment inside and outside the home 

in addition our ability to compete effectively is in part dependent on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers consumers advertisers investors and governmental authorities there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the future against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

changes in technology and consumer behavior may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

new technologies have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors we face for our cable services our cable distribution and programming advertising businesses and nbcuniversal’s businesses for example new services and technologies that may compete with our video services include online services and devices that offer internet video streaming and downloading of movies television shows and other video programming that can be viewed on television sets as well as wireless and other emerging mobile technologies that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content which could adversely affect our cable programming and broadcast businesses the success of these new services and technologies also could negatively impact the demand for our video services including for our advanced premium and on demand services moreover changes in the products and services that our competitors offer may require that we offer certain of our existing services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers further the increasing number of choices available to our customers could adversely affect advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us in addition newer services in wireless internet technology such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services may compete with our highspeed internet services and our phone services are facing increased competition from wireless and internetbased phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with these phone services the success of any of these ongoing and future developments may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

  

 

   

moreover the use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide our competitors with a competitive advantage for example in some cases phone companies are using ip technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and wireless internet technologies continue to evolve we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective costefficient or attractive to customers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by our customers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

new technologies also are affecting consumer behavior in ways that may have a negative impact on revenue for our programming content for example the increased availability of dvrs and video programming on the internet as well as increased access to various media through mobile devices have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets some of these new technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a timedelayed or ondemand basis or to fastforward or skip advertisements within our programming which may adversely impact the advertising revenue we receive delayed viewing and advertising skipping have the potential to become more common as the penetration of dvrs increases and content becomes increasingly available via internet sources changes in technology distribution platforms and consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

programming expenses for our video services are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future the mvpd industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers we incur increased programming expenses we also expect to be subject to increasing demands including demands for cash payments and other concessions by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our customers if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations moreover as our programming contracts and retransmission consents with programming providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services 

and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction our businesses are subject to the conditions set forth in the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by the parties and imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the treatment of competitors and other matters among other things i we are required to make certain of our cable broadcast and film programming available to bona fide online video distributors under certain conditions and they may invoke commercial arbitration to determine what programming must be made available and the price terms and conditions that apply ii multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration to determine the price terms and conditions for access to our broadcast stations cable networks and regional sports networks iii we are prohibited from discriminating against cable programming networks on the basis of their nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage under a standard that is comparable to existing law iv we must comply with the fcc’s open internet rules regardless of whether these rules are invalidated in court or otherwise rescinded and those rules will apply to any settop box we provide that enables a customer to receive highspeed internet services v we must satisfy various other conditions relating to our highspeed internet services including deploying broadband to certain unserved areas implementing a program to improve highspeed internet adoption among lowerincome households offering all our customers a “standalone” highspeed internet service and maintaining a highspeed internet service of at least 12 megabits per second across most of our footprint and vi we must renew our distribution agreement with hulu if the two other broadcast network owners of hulu also renew their agreements and we must relinquish all voting rights and our board seat in hulu these and other conditions and commitments relating to the nbcuniversal transaction are of varying duration ranging from three to seven years although we cannot predict how the conditions will be administered or what effects they will have on our businesses we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations there can be no assurance however that there will not be any legal challenges to the nbcuniversal consent decree 

we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip digital phone service industries we expect that 

 

  

 

   

legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws 

in addition local franchising authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition of renewal or transfer and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in addition we could be disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if phone companies that provide video services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us for example the fcc has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants see “legislation and regulation — cable services — video services — franchising” above for additional information 

the television broadcasting and content distribution industries in the united states also are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations for example nbcuniversal’s owned local television stations may be adversely affected by recent proposals to reallocate spectrum for broadband capability that is currently available for television broadcasters as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction our businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international federal state and local levels including laws and regulations relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer products and theme park operations which may have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations 

failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability in addition congress is constantly considering new legislative requirements as are various regulatory agencies such as the fcc which could potentially affect our businesses any future legislative judicial or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses which could materially affect our results of operations for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the regulation of all of our businesses see “legislation and regulation” above 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

weak economic conditions including a weak housing market persisted during 2010 a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions to the extent these weak economic conditions continue customers may reduce the advanced or premium services to which they subscribe or may 

discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as video streaming over the internet or substitute services such as wireless phones the weak economy negatively affected our net cable services customer additions during 2010 moreover weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable and programming businesses weak economic conditions could also reduce prices that mvpds pay for our cable television programming and has reduced and could continue to reduce the performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases and attendance and spending for our theme parks business if these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

a decline in advertising expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our results of operations 

our cable distribution cable programming and broadcast businesses derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms and a decline in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technologies or by the economy in general causing advertisers to alter their spending priorities based on these or other factors in addition advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings for our television programming changes in the advertising industry also could adversely affect the advertising revenue of our cable programming and broadcast networks for example we rely on nielsen ratings and nielsen’s audience measurement techniques to measure the popularity of our content a change in such measurement techniques or the introduction of new techniques could negatively impact the advertising revenue we receive further natural disasters wars acts of terrorism or other significant adverse news events could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty reductions in advertising expenditures could negatively impact our results of operations 

nbcuniversal’s success depends on consumer acceptance of its content which is difficult to predict and our results of operations may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or our costs to acquire content increase 

most of nbcuniversal’s businesses create media and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute programming filmed entertainment theme park attractions and 

 

  

 

   

other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer market nbcuniversal historically has invested substantial amounts in its content including in the production of original content before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance we intend to continue to invest significantly in this area in addition we obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties such as movie studios television production companies sports organizations and other suppliers competition for popular content is intense and we may be forced to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content renewing our contract rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition poor theatrical performance of a film may require us to reduce our estimate of revenue from that film which would accelerate the amortization of capitalized film costs and could result in a significant writeoff and may adversely affect multiple reporting periods 

the loss of our programming distribution agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our business 

our cable programming networks depend on the maintenance of distribution agreements with multichannel video providers our broadcast networks depend on the maintenance of network affiliation agreements with thirdparty local television stations in the markets where we do not own our local television stations in addition every three years each of our owned local television stations must elect with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its dma either “mustcarry” status pursuant to which the distributor’s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station or “retransmission consent” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor in the course of renewing distribution agreements with multichannel video providers we may enter into retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our owned local television stations all of our nbc affiliated owned local television stations have elected the retransmission consent option while our owned telemundo affiliated stations have elected mustcarry or retransmission consent depending on circumstances there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing agreements will be renewed in the future on acceptable terms or at all the loss of any of these agreements or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could reduce the reach of our television programming and its attractiveness to advertisers which in turn could adversely affect our business 

sales of dvds have been declining 

several factors including weak economic conditions the maturation of the standarddefinition dvd format piracy and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time are contributing to an industrywide decline in dvd sales both in the united states and internationally which has had an adverse effect on nbcuniversal’s results of operations dvd sales have also been adversely affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment such as ondemand services which generate less revenue per transaction than dvd sales media and entertainment industries face a challenge in managing the transition from physical to electronic formats in a manner that generates sufficient revenue to maintain historical profits and growth there can be no assurance that dvd wholesale prices and sales volumes can be maintained at current levels due to aggressive retail pricing and the consumer transition to digital and lowerpriced rental services 

we rely on network and information systems and other technology as well as key properties and a disruption failure or destruction of such networks systems technology or properties may disrupt our business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our properties equipment and data these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach the occurrence of any such network or information systemsrelated events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

  

 

   

  

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services moreover some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected in which case our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties to use various technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

in addition nbcuniversal’s intellectual property constitutes a significant part of its value and the success of its businesses is highly dependent on protecting its intellectual property rights in the content it creates or acquires against thirdparty misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content as well as from the sale of advertising on our content and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of protecting our intellectual property rights piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging by technological advances allow 

ing the conversion of programming films and other content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies in particular piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution on dvds peertopeer computer networks and other platforms continues to present challenges for our cable programming and broadcast networks and filmed entertainment businesses while piracy is a challenge in the united states it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the united states or internationally that are intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights negatively impacting their value or increasing the costs of enforcing our rights see “legislation and regulation — other areas — intellectual property and piracy” above for additional information 

labor disputes whether involving our own employees or sports leagues may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

many of nbcuniversal’s employees including writers directors actors technical and production personnel and others as well as some of our onair and creative talent are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us moreover many of nbcuniversal’s collective bargaining agreements are industrywide agreements and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements a labor dispute involving our employees may result in work stoppages or disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue and resolution of disputes may increase our costs for example a writers guild of america strike in 20072008 disrupted nbcuniversal’s ability to produce scripted television programming causing viewership levels and ratings to decline which resulted in lower us advertising revenue for the nbc network there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages 

in addition our cable programming networks our regional sports networks and our broadcast networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues and associations to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain nfl nhl and national basketball association “nba” games labor disputes in these and other sports leagues or associations could have an adverse impact on our businesses revenue and results of operations the current collective bargaining agreement with both the nfl and the nba players’ union expire at the end of their respective 20102011 

  

 

   

  

seasons collective bargaining agreement with the nba’s players’ union expires following the end of the 20102011 season our programming rights agreement with the nfl requires us to make significant payments to the nfl and at the nfl’s option we may be required to make these payments even if the nfl does not play all or part of a season during the term of our agreement because of a player strike or lockout in the absence of a timely agreement protracted negotiations could result in a player strike or lockout in which case the number of nfl games that we broadcast and our revenue from those broadcasts may be reduced although the nfl would be required to credit or refund the rights fee attributable to the lost games to us in addition to paying interest and outofpocket production costs if all or part of an nfl season is canceled it would have the right to apportion the credit or refund throughout the remaining term of our agreement potentially all in the final year of the term the timing of such payments and refunds could have an impact on our cash flows during the relevant period in addition any labor disputes that occur in any sports league or association for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those referred to in “legal proceedings” and those arising in the ordinary course of business including regulatory and administrative proceedings claims and audits while we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our financial condition an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be timeconsuming costly and injure our reputation further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction including the nbcuniversal transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in particular the nbcuniversal transaction involves the integration of the comcast content business with nbcuniversal’s businesses as well as the integration of nbcuniversal’s businesses with our cable distribution and other businesses we as well as nbcuniversal will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to continue integrating these businesses challenges involved in the integration include successfully integrating each company’s operations technologies and content and combining corporate cultures maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate these businesses or succeed in the highly competitive media industry moreover there can be no assurance that nbcuniversal will be able to generate strong cash flows or favorable financial returns 

the loss of key management personnel or popular onair and creative talent could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business in addition nbcuniversal’s businesses depend on the continued efforts abilities and expertise of its onair and creative talent if we fail to retain our onair or creative talent if the costs to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payments or if these individuals lose their current appeal our business could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business 

our operation of businesses worldwide increased substantially as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including economic volatility and the global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations potentially adverse tax developments political or social unrest corruption and risks related to government regulation if these risks come to pass our business may be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

 

we are a leading provider of video highspeed internet and phone services “cable services” to residential and business customers in the united states on january 28 2011 we closed our transaction with general electric company “ge” in which we acquired control of the businesses of nbcuniversal inc now named nbcuniversal media llc “nbcuniversal” a leading media and entertainment company that develops produces and distributes entertainment news sports and other content to global audiences further details about the transaction are presented below under the heading “nbcuniversal transaction” 

our cable segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services which we market individually and in packages in addition to cable services other cable segment revenue sources include the sale of advertising and as of december 31 2010 the operations of our regional sports and news networks as of december 31 2010 our cable systems served approximately 228 million video customers 170 million highspeed internet customers and 86 million phone customers and passed more than 51 million homes and businesses in 39 states and the district of columbia in 2010 our cable segment generated approximately 94 of our consolidated revenue 

our video services range from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels on demand music channels and an interactive onscreen program guide digital video customers also may subscribe to our advanced services which consist of highdefinition television “hdtv” and digital video recorder “dvr” and access certain of our programming online based on their level of video service our highspeed internet services provide internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 mbps depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability our phone services provide local and longdistance calling and other features we also offer our cable services to small and mediumsized businesses “business services” 

as of december 31 2010 our programming segment consisted primarily of our consolidated national programming networks e golf channel versus style and g4 during 2010 our programming segment generated consolidated revenue of 17 billion revenue from our programming segment is generated primarily from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers the sale of advertising and the licensing of our programming internationally

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment competition for the cable services we offer primarily includes direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and phone companies in 2010 our competitors for cable services continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer a substantial portion of our cable segment revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions 

2010 developments 

in addition to the nbcuniversal transaction discussed below the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2010 

 

  

  

  

  

  



 

  

 

   

  

  

  

 nbcuniversal transaction 

on january 28 2011 we closed our transaction with ge to form a new company named nbcuniversal llc “nbcuniversal holdings” we now control and own 51 of nbcuniversal holdings and ge owns the remaining 49 as part of the nbcuniversal transaction ge contributed the historical businesses of nbcuniversal which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of nbcuniversal holdings the nbcuniversal contributed businesses include its national cable programming networks the nbc network and its owned nbc affiliated local television stations the telemundo network and its owned telemundo affiliated local television stations universal pictures filmed entertainment the universal studios hollywood theme park and other related assets we contributed our national cable programming networks our regional sports and news networks certain of our internet businesses including dailycandy and fandango and other related assets “comcast content business” in addition to contributing the comcast content business to nbcuniversal we made a cash payment of 62 billion at the closing 

as a result of the nbcuniversal transaction beginning in 2011 we expect to present five reportable segments cable distribution currently presented in our cable segment cable networks broadcast networks filmed entertainment and theme parks our programming segment our regional sports and news networks currently presented in our cable segment and our contributed comcast interactive media businesses currently in corporate and other will be presented with nbcuniversal’s businesses in the new segments the businesses of comcast interactive media that were not contributed to nbcuniversal will be included in our cable distribution segment 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction we have incurred incremental expenses related to legal accounting and valuation services which are reflected in operating selling general and administrative expenses we also incurred certain financing costs and other shared costs with ge associated with debt facilities that were entered into in december 2009 and with the issuance of nbcuniversal’s senior notes in 2010 which are reflected in other 

income expense and interest expense the table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of operations 

 

 in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction nbcuniversal issued 91 billion of senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041 and repaid approximately 17 billion of existing debt during 2010 immediately prior to the closing nbcuniversal distributed approximately 74 billion to ge 

under the terms of the operating agreement of nbcuniversal holdings during the six month period beginning on july 28 2014 ge has the right to cause nbcuniversal holdings to redeem half of ge’s interest in nbcuniversal holdings and during the six month period beginning january 28 2018 ge has the right to cause nbcuniversal holdings to redeem ge’s remaining interest if any if ge exercises its first redemption right we have the immediate right to purchase the remainder of ge’s interest if ge does not exercise its first redemption right during the six month period beginning on january 28 2016 we have the right to purchase half of ge’s interest in nbcuniversal holdings during the six month period beginning january 28 2019 we have the right to purchase ge’s remaining interest if any in nbcuniversal holdings the purchase price to be paid in connection with any purchase described in this paragraph will be equal to the ownership percentage being purchased multiplied by an amount equal to 120 of the fully distributed public market trading value of nbcuniversal holdings determined pursuant to an appraisal process if nbcuniversal holdings is not then publicly traded less 50 of an amount not less than zero equal to the excess of 120 of the fully distributed public market trading value over 284 billion subject to various limitations we are committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two redemptions up to an aggregate of 575 billion with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption to the extent nbcuniversal holdings cannot fund the redemptions 

until july 28 2014 ge may not directly or indirectly transfer its interest in nbcuniversal holdings thereafter ge may transfer its interest to a third party subject to our right of first offer the right of first offer would permit us to purchase all but not less than all of the interests proposed to be transferred in the event that ge makes a registration request in accordance with certain registration rights that are granted to it under the agreement we will have the right to purchase for cash at the market value determined pursuant to an appraisal process if nbcuniversal holdings is not then publicly traded all of ge’s interest in nbcuniversal holdings that ge is seeking to register 

 

  

 

   

consolidated operating results 

 

 

 all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

consolidated revenue 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated revenue for 2010 and 2009 the remaining changes related to our other business activities primarily comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor cable segment revenue and programming segment revenue are discussed separately under the heading “segment operating results” 

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009 the remaining changes related to our other business activities primarily comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor and costs associated with the nbcuniversal transaction cable segment and program 

ming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses are discussed separately under the heading “segment operating results” 

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

depreciation expense for 2010 and 2009 remained relatively stable primarily due to decreases in capital spending in recent years 

the increase in amortization expense for 2010 was primarily related to goodwill impairment charges taken in our programming segment and in corporate and other totaling 76 million the increase in amortization expense for 2009 was primarily due to an increase in software intangibles 

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information to measure the performance of our operating segments we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs 

 

  

 

   

we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

cable segment overview 

 

our cable systems allow us to deliver video highspeed internet and phone services to our residential and business customers the majority of our cable segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to these cable services customers are billed 

monthly based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts which typically have 1 to 3 year terms our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization increased as a result of continued demand for our services including our bundled and advanced service offerings and the effects of recent acquisitions as well as other factors discussed below 

 

 

cable segment results of operations 

 

  

   

 

 cable segment revenue 

our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to approximately 129 in 2010 from approximately 118 in 2009 and approximately 111 in 2008 the increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer are primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving multiple services rate adjustments contributions from business services and advertising revenue 

video 

we offer video services ranging from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels as of december 31 2010 approximately 44 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services as of december 31 2010 87 of those video customers subscribed to at least one of our digital video services compared to 78 and 70 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively digital video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services hdtv and dvr as of december 31 2010 approximately 51 of our digital video customers subscribed to at least one of our advanced services 

our video revenue continued to grow in 2010 and 2009 due to rate adjustments and customer upgrades to our digital and advanced services which were offset by declines in the number of analog residential video customers in both years during 2010 and 2009 the number of video customers decreased by approximately 757000 and 623000 respectively these decreases were primarily due to the loss of customers upon expiration of discounted promotions in 2010 competitive pressures in our service areas and weakness in the economy we expect further declines in the number of residential video customers during 2011 for similar reasons during 2010 and 2009 we added or upgraded to our digital video service approximately 13 million customers and 14 million customers respectively including those customers added or upgraded in connection with our all digital conversion 

highspeed internet 

we offer highspeed internet services with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 mbps depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability these services also include our internet portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of content and features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet services we provide our highspeed internet service for business customers also includes a website hosting service and an online tool that allows customers to share coordinate and store documents as of december 31 2010 33 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 31 and 30 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively our highspeed internet revenue increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of residential and business 

customers and in 2010 due to rate adjustments during 2010 and 2009 we added approximately 11 million and 10 million highspeed internet customers respectively 

phone 

we offer phone services that provide local and longdistance calling and include features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting our phone service for business customers also includes a business directory listing and the option to add multiple phone lines as of december 31 2010 our phone services were available to substantially all of the homes in the areas we serve as of december 31 2010 approximately 17 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our phone services compared to 16 and 14 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively our phone revenue increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of residential and business customers during 2010 and 2009 we added approximately 988000 and 11 million phone customers respectively 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects these interconnects establish a physical direct link among multiple providers for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator 

advertising revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to improvements in the overall television advertising market including political advertising advertising revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in the overall television advertising market as a result of weak economic conditions and a decline in political advertising 

other 

we also generate revenue from our regional sports and news networks our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services our regional sports and news networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet northwest portland comcast sports southwest houston comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco new england cable news boston comcast network philadelphia and comcast network midatlantic baltimorewashington these networks generate revenue from program 

 

  

 

   

ming license agreements with multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising these networks were contributed to nbcuniversal at the close of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 

franchise and other regulatory fees 

our franchise and other regulatory fee revenue represents the passthrough to our customers of the fees required to be paid to federal state and local authorities under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the 

franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the increases in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable customers in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to increases in the revenue on which the fees apply 

cable segment expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margin operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for 2010 2009 and 2008 was 407 404 and 403 respectively 

 

 

cable segment operating expenses 

 

  

  

video programming expenses our largest operating expense are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we distribute to our video customers these expenses are affected by changes in the fees charged by programming networks the number of video customers we serve and the number of channels and programs we provide video programming expenses increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increased rates additional digital customers and additional programming options offered the increase in 2009 was also due to the introduction of fees incurred for retransmission of broadcast networks we anticipate that our video programming expenses will continue to increase as the fees charged by programming networks increase as new fees for retransmission of broadcast networks are incurred and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our customers 

technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor costs to complete service call and installation activities in the home as well as network operations fulfillment and provisioning costs these expenses remained relatively stable in 2010 technical labor expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to increases in customer service activity levels which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide inhome customer support and due 

to activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion 

highspeed internet expenses and phone expenses include certain direct costs for providing these services but do not fully reflect the amount of operating expenses that would be necessary to provide these services on a standalone basis other related costs associated with providing these services are generally shared among all our cable services and are not allocated to these items the decreases in highspeed internet expenses in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to lower support service costs that were the result of operating efficiencies phone expenses in 2010 remained consistent with 2009 expenses despite increases in customer volume phone expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower support service costs that were the result of operating efficiencies 

other operating expenses include franchise fees pole rentals plant maintenance vehiclerelated costs expenses related to our regional sports and news networks advertising representation and commission fees and expenses associated with our business services these expenses increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in advertising activity the continued expansion of business services and other service enhancement initiatives 

 

 

cable segment selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

   

 

   

  

customer service expenses decreased in 2010 primarily due to operating efficiencies higher levels of activity in 2009 related to the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion customer service expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion 

marketing expenses increased in 2010 primarily due to an increase in direct sales efforts and additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining customers as well as the launch of 

our xfinity brand marketing expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower costs and volume for media advertising partially offset by an increase in direct sales efforts 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we implemented personnel and cost reduction programs that were focused on streamlining our cable operations in connection with these initiatives we recorded 66 million 81 million and 126 million of severance costs during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively administrative and other expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of the programs initiated in 2008

programming revenue increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to growth in advertising revenue and programming license fee revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 advertising accounted for approximately 40 41 and 43 respectively of total programming revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 12 of our programming revenue was generated from our cable segment these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

  

programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses 

programming operating selling general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events the purchase of programming rights the marketing and promotion of our programming networks and administrative costs 

  

 

   

consolidated other income expense items 

 

 

 interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense for 2010 is primarily due to 175 million of early extinguishment losses net of early extinguishment gains associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity that were recognized in 2009 and decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements and decreases in interest rates on our variable rate debt partially offset by an increase in early extinguishment costs in 2009 during 2009 and 2008 interest expense included 175 million and 64 million respectively of early extinguishment losses net of early extinguishment gains associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity 

investment income loss net 

the components of investment income loss net for 2010 2009 and 2008 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and substantially all of our investments accounted for as availableforsale securities the differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements as presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  



 other income expense 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction we agreed to share with ge certain financing and other costs associated with debt facilities that were entered into in december 2009 and with the issuance of nbcuniversal’s senior notes in 2010 other income expense for 2010 includes 129 million of expenses for our share of these costs other income expense for 2010 also includes income of 141 million related to the sale of one of our equity method investments and 108 million related to recoveries in connection with the resolution of a contingency of an acquired company 

other expense for 2008 includes an impairment of approximately 600 million related to our investment in clearwire llc partially offset by a gain of approximately 235 million related to the insight transaction see note 5 and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2010 2009 and 2008 was 399 289 and 378 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions our 2009 income tax expense was reduced by approximately 566 million primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with settlements and adjustments of uncertain tax positions and related interest and certain subsidiary reorganizations that impacted deferred state income taxes our 2008 income tax expense was reduced by approximately 154 million primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position and the net impact of certain state tax law changes which primarily affected our deferred income tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and the future deductibility of certain deferred compensation arrangements our income tax expense may in the future continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in state tax laws we expect our 2011 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35 to 40 due to the partnership structure of nbcuniversal holdings 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing 

 

  

 

   

we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities to meet our debt repayment obligations and to return capital to shareholders 

we traditionally maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2010 amounts available under all of our credit facilities totaled approximately 64 billion as of the closing of the nbcuniversal transaction on january 28 2011 nbcuniversal had a 750 million threeyear revolving credit facility 

we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our businesses or raise additional capital we test our compliance with our credit facilities’ covenants on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in our 68 billion revolving credit facility due 2013 pertains to leverage ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2010 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin we do not expect to have to further reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant 

in connection with the nbcuniversal transaction we were required to make a cash payment of 62 billion we funded this payment with cash on hand and 650 million of commercial paper borrowings the cash paid will be adjusted after the close to reflect final balances of certain working capital accounts and other closing adjustments the transaction also calls for the payment to ge in the future of certain tax benefits to the extent realized by us beginning in 2011 we will consolidate 91 billion of nbcuniversal senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041 we do not guarantee nbcuniversal’s debt obligations any future redemptions of ge’s stake in nbcuniversal holdings are expected to be funded primarily through nbcuniversal’s cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity if any borrowings by nbcuniversal to fund either of ge’s two potential redemptions would result in nbcuniversal exceeding a certain leverage ratio or losing investment grade status or if it cannot otherwise fund such redemptions we are committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two potential redemptions for an aggregate of up to 575 billion with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption to the extent nbcuniversal holdings cannot fund the redemptions 

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to the timing of payments of operating items and payroll in 2009 there was a significant reduction in accrued liabilities due to a payroll period occurring at the end of the year 

the decrease in interest payments in 2010 was primarily due to the effects of early extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of our debt obligations in connection with a cash tender offer in july 2009 the decrease in interest payments in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements the effects of our debt repayments and the maturity of certain higher rate debt in 2008 

the increase in income tax payments in 2010 was primarily due to increases in 2010 taxable income partially offset by tax payments made in 2009 that related to prior years the increase in income tax payments in 2009 was primarily due to increases in 2009 taxable income the settlements of uncertain tax positions and a tax payment made in 2009 that related to 2008 partially offset by the net benefits of approximately 341 million from the 2008 and 2009 economic stimulus legislation 

 

  

 

   

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures intangible assets acquisitions and investments 

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable segment and we expect that this will continue in the future a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and technologies being deployed the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment from 2008 through 2010 

 

 cable capital expenditures decreased 38 and 92 in 2010 and 2009 respectively primarily due to fewer residential unit additions and improved equipment pricing partially offset by increased investment in our business services and strategic initiatives such as our all digital conversion and the continued deployment of docsis 30 wideband technology 

capital expenditures in our programming segment were not significant in 2010 2009 or 2008 in 2008 our corporate and other business activities included approximately 137 million of capital expenditures related to the consolidation of offices and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 

capital expenditures for 2011 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services 

acquisitions 

on january 28 2011 we closed the nbcuniversal transaction see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements our 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were not significant in 2008 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisition of an additional interest in comcast sportsnet bay area our acquisition of the remaining interest in g4 that we did not already own and our acquisitions of plaxo and dailycandy 

proceeds from sales of investments 

in 2008 proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of availableforsale debt securities 

purchases of investments 

in 2010 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the purchase of an equity method investment in the houston regional sports network in 2009 purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in clearwire in 2008 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the funding of our initial investment in clearwire 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from borrowings offset by our repurchases and repayments of debt repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions in 2009 we made 16 billion of optional repurchases of our outstanding public bonds and zones debt 

in july 2009 we completed a cash tender to repurchase approximately 13 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes for approximately 15 billion we recognized additional interest expense of approximately 180 million primarily associated with the premiums incurred in the tender offer the premiums related to the tender offer are included in other financing activities 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings 

share repurchases and dividends 

in 2010 we repurchased approximately 70 million shares of our class a special common stock under our share repurchase authorization for approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 21 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization we intend to complete repurchases under the current share repurchase authorization by the end of 2011 subject to market conditions 

 

  

 

   

 

our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling 11 billion in 2010 we paid dividends of 11 billion in 2010 in january 2011 our board of directors approved an increase of 19 to our planned annual dividend to 045 per share and approved the first quarterly dividend of 01125 per share to be paid in april 2011 we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced video services and highspeed internet and phone services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value “impairment testing” we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by under 

lying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

if we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights was less than the carrying amount we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our cable divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge 

we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the july 1 2010 annual impairment testing the table below illustrates the impairment related to our cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing 

 

 the cable divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment in november 2010 our cable division management structure was reorganized from four divisions to three with certain regions from the prior divisions being moved to a different division within the new management structure we reperformed our impairment testing immediately before the reorganization and no impairment was indicated 

income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax posi 

 

  

 

   

tions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant 

information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period as of december 31 2010 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were approximately 13 billion and 604 million respectively 

 

  

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which can include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 997 to 829 as of december 31 2010 in 2010 2009 and 2008 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of approximately 132 million 104 million and 34 million respectively interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

 

 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2010 

 

 we use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate “libor” for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2010 plus the applicable borrowing margin on december 31 2010 

certain of our financial contracts include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of both december 31 2010 and 2009 the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of 26 million the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our derivative financial instruments 

 

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying 

assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments 

 

  

 

   

except as described above in “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading or availableforsale securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 6 and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our investments and derivative financial instruments 

foreign currency exchange risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as they relate to our foreign currency denominated debt obligations crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert fixed rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed rate us dollar denominated debt hedging the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates the gains and losses on the crosscurrency swaps offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures as of december 31 2010 we had crosscurrency swaps on all of our outstanding £625 million of 550 senior notes due 2029 other foreign currency denominated balances were not significant as of december 31 2010 and 

2009 the nbcuniversal transaction will increase our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our derivative financial instruments 

counterparty credit risk management 

 

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant we have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions these provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold the threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties’ credit ratings as of december 31 2010 neither we nor any of the counterparties were required to post collateral under the terms of the agreements

general developments of our businesses 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

   

   

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and phone companies in 2009 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer in addition a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions intensifying competition and the weak economy negatively affected our results of operations in 2009 and may continue to impact our results of operations in the future

cable services 

we offer a variety of services over our cable systems including video highspeed internet and phone services we market our cable services individually and in packages substantially all of our customers are residential customers we have traditionally offered our video services to restaurants and hotels and we are now also offering our cable services to small and mediumsized businesses “commercial services” subscription rates and related charges vary according to the service selected and the type of equipment the customer uses and customers typically pay us on a monthly basis residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time while commercial customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts which typically have one to three year terms 

we are focusing our technology initiatives on extending the capacity and efficiency of our networks increasing the capacity and functionality of advanced settop boxes developing and integrating crossservice features and functionality and developing interactive internet protocolbased services 

video services 

our video service offerings range from a limited analog service to a full digital service as well as advanced services which consist of highdefinition television “hdtv” andor digital video recorders “dvr” we tailor our video services for each cable system serving a particular geographic area according to applicable local and federal regulatory requirements programming preferences and demographics 

our analog video services range from a limited basic service with access to between 20 and 30 channels of programming to an expanded basic service with access to between 60 and 80 channels of programming our digital video services range from a digital starter service with access to between 40 and 50 channels to a full digital service with access to over 250 channels our video services generally include programming provided by national and local broadcast networks national and regional cable networks as well as governmental and public access programming our digital video services generally include access to over 40 music channels our on demand service and an interactive onscreen program guide we also offer some packages with extensive amounts of spanishlanguage programming as well as specialty tiers with sports family or international themes 

our video customers may also subscribe to premium channel programming premium channels include cable networks such as hbo showtime starz and cinemax which generally offer without commercial interruption movies original programming live and taped sporting events concerts and other special features 

our on demand service provides our digital video customers the opportunity to choose from a selection of more than 17000 

standarddefinition and highdefinition programming choices over the course of a month start the programs at whatever time is convenient and pause rewind and fastforward the programs the majority of our on demand content is available to our digital video customers at no additional charge digital video customers subscribing to a premium channel generally have access to the premium channel’s on demand content without additional fees we also offer a feebased on demand service that provides our video customers the opportunity to order individual new release and library movies and specialevent programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts we are continuing to expand the number of on demand choices including hdtv programming choices 

our hdtv service provides our video customers with improved highresolution picture quality improved audio quality and a widescreen format our hdtv service offers our digital video customers a broad selection of highdefinition programming choices including most major broadcast networks leading national cable networks premium channels and regional sports networks in addition our on demand service provides over 2600 hdtv programming choices over the course of a month our dvr service lets digital video customers select record and store programs and play them at whatever time is convenient our dvr service also provides the ability to pause and rewind “live” television during 2009 we began to offer certain cable network programming online to customers of both our video and highspeed internet services through fancast xfinity tv 

highspeed internet services 

we offer highspeed internet services with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 50 mbps depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability these services also include our interactive portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet services we provide our commercial highspeed internet service also includes a website hosting service and an online tool that allows customers to share coordinate and store documents 

phone services 

we offer a voice over internet protocol “voip” digital phone service that provides either usagebased or unlimited local and domestic longdistance calling including features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting we phased out substantially all of our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 our commercial phone service also includes a business directory listing and the option to add multiple phone lines 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we often receive an allocation of scheduled advertising 

  

   

time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects these interconnects establish a physical direct link between multiple providers for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator we are also in the process of developing technology for interactive advertising 

regional sports networks 

our regional sports networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet northwest portland comcast sports southwest houston and comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco these networks generate revenue from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising 

other revenue sources 

we also generate revenue from our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services 

sources of supply 

to offer our video services we license a substantial portion of our programming and the associated on demand offerings from broadcast and cable programming networks and we generally pay a monthly fee for such programming on a per video subscriber per channel basis we attempt to secure longterm programming licenses with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives from these programming networks we also license individual programs or packages of programs from programming suppliers for our on demand service generally under shorterterm agreements 

our video programming expenses depend on the number of our video customers the number of channels and programs we provide and the programming license fees we are charged we expect our video programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item and to increase in the future 

we purchase a significant number of settop boxes and network equipment and services that we use in providing our cable services from a limited number of suppliers 

for our highspeed internet portal comcastnet we license software products such as email and security software and content such as news feeds from a variety of suppliers under contracts in 

which we generally pay on a fixedfee basis on a per customer basis in the case of software product licenses or on a video advertising revenue share basis in the case of content licenses 

to offer our phone services we license software products such as voice mail from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts the fees we pay are based on the consumption of the related services 

we utilize two vendors to provide our subscriber billing 

customer and technical services 

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers call centers provide 247 callanswering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services group performs various tasks including installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

technology 

our cable systems employ a network architecture of hybrid fiber coax that we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements this network allows the twoway delivery of transmissions which is essential to providing interactive video services such as on demand and highspeed internet and phone services 

we continue to work on technology initiatives including 

 

  

  

  

 

  

   

  

 sales and marketing 

we offer our products and services directly to residential and commercial customers through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising television advertising internet advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets we also market our video highspeed internet and phone services individually and as bundled services 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment we compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and phone companies in 2009 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer in addition phone companies have continued to expand their service areas which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas these competitive factors have had an impact on and are likely to continue to negatively affect our results of operations in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment where the use of certain types of technology may provide our competitors with a competitive advantage and where new technologies are likely to increase the number of competitors we face for our cable services and our advertising business we expect advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to continue in the future and we are unable to predict what effects these developments may have on our businesses and operations 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

   

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings furthermore the fcc and various state governments have adopted measures that reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including phone companies certain of these franchising entry measures have already been adopted in many states in which we operate we believe that we have been and continue to be materially disadvantaged as a result of these fcc rules which apply less burdensome standards for certain types of our competitors see “legislation and regulation” below 

direct broadcast satellite systems 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to approximately 38 million customers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 250 channels of programming including video services substantially similar to those offered by our video services two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs customers 

highpower satellite service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outdoor antennas satellite systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their customers our digital video services are competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals currently delivered to customers by dbs providers 

federal law generally provides satellite systems with access to cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite dbs providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with the phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

phone companies 

certain phone companies in particular att and verizon have built and continue to build fiberopticbased networks to provide 

  

   

cable services similar to ours these phone companies now offer their video services in a substantial portion of our service areas in some areas this expansion has been accelerated by certain regulatory authorities adopting new rules designed to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new providers of video services and by some phone companies claiming that they can provide their video services without a local cable franchise see “legislation and regulation” below in some areas these phone companies also have marketing arrangements with dbs providers in which their highspeed internet and phone services are sold together with a dbs provider’s video services 

other wireline providers 

we operate our cable systems under nonexclusive franchises that are issued by a local governing body such as a city council or county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable services also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer customers both improved reception of local television broadcast stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv system operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and commercial developments 

other competitors 

our cable services also may compete to some degree for customers with other companies such as 

 

  

  

  

   

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of companies offering internet services many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

 digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems phone companies and certain other companies offer dsl service and several of these companies have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some phone companies such as att and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higher speed services in many of our service areas the fcc has reduced the obligations of phone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless phone companies are offering 3g and 4g wireless highspeed internet services in addition a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports offer wifi internet service numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and wimax internet access networks and commercial wimax offerings are being rolled out in some of our service areas by competing wireless providers 

phone services 

our phone services compete against wireline phone companies including competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” wireless phone service providers and other voip service providers certain phone companies such as att and verizon have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

advertising 

we compete for the sale of advertising against a wide variety of media including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional programming networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and internet sites 

  

   

programming segment 

 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks the table below presents a summary of our consolidated national programming networks 

 

  

revenue for our programming networks is primarily generated from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our programming networks the sale of advertising and the licensing of our programming internationally to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both our programming networks assist distributors with ongoing marketing and promotional activities to acquire and retain customers although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our programming networks by larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of such distributors could have a material adverse effect on our programming networks 

sources of supply 

our programming networks often produce their own television programs and broadcasts of live events this often requires us to acquire the rights to the content that is used in such productions such as rights to screenplays or sporting events in other cases our programming networks license the cable telecast rights to television programs produced by third parties 

competition 

our networks compete with other programming networks for distribution and programming in addition our programming networks compete for audience share with all other forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast networks local television broadcast stations pay and other cable networks home video payperview and video on demand services and internet sites finally our programming networks compete for advertising revenue with other national and local media including other television networks television stations radio stations newspapers internet sites and direct mail 

other businesses 

 

our other business interests include comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor comcast interactive media develops and 

operates our internet businesses focused on entertainment information and communication including comcastnet fancast the platform fandango plaxo and dailycandy comcast spectacor owns two professional sports teams the philadelphia 76ers and the philadelphia flyers and a large multipurpose arena in philadelphia the wachovia center and provides facilities management services including food services for sporting events concerts and other events 

we also own noncontrolling interests in certain networks and content providers including fearnet 33 in demand 54 mgm 20 music choice 12 pbs kids sprout 40 pittsburgh cable news channel 30 tv one 34 and sportsnet new york 8 in addition we have noncontrolling interests in wirelessrelated companies including clearwire communications llc 9 and spectrumco llc 64 

legislation and regulation 

our cable segment is subject to regulation by federal state and local governmental authorities under applicable laws and regulations as well as under agreements we enter into with franchising authorities the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable segment including cable system ownership video customer rates carriage of broadcast television stations how we sell our programming packages to customers access to cable system channels by franchising authorities and other parties the use of utility poles and conduits and the offering of our highspeed internet and phone services our programming segment is also subject to some governmental regulation 

federal regulation and regulatory scrutiny of our cable and programming segments have increased in recent years even as the cable industry has become subject to increasing competition from dbs providers phone companies and others for video highspeed 

  

   

internet and phone services meanwhile the fcc has provided regulatory relief and various regulatory advantages to our competitors examples of which are provided below further in some areas the communications act treats certain multichannel video programming distributors differently from others for example ownership limits pricing and packaging regulation mustcarry rules and franchising regulations are not applicable to our dbs competitors regulation continues to present significant adverse risks to our businesses 

it is possible that federal regulators will condition their approval of the nbc universal transaction on our agreeing to significant new regulatory obligations for our businesses or to limits on our business activities additionally if our transaction with nbc universal closes we would become subject to the array of broadcasting regulations and public interest obligations applicable to nbc universal’s broadcasting stations 

regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing rules or prescribe new ones for example some parties have proposed that the fcc subject our highspeed internet services to the kinds of regulations that apply to common carrier telecommunications services which would be a dramatic change from the regulatory approach that has applied to our highspeed internet services to date we are unable to predict how any such changes will ultimately affect the regulation of our businesses in addition we always face the risk that congress or one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our businesses such as proposed federal legislation that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization the following paragraphs describe existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements for our businesses 

video services 

 

ownership limits 

we currently serve approximately 24 of the multichannel video customers nationwide in august 2009 a federal appellate court struck down an fcc order that had established a 30 limit on the percentage of multichannel video customers that any single cable operator could serve nationwide while there is currently no limit on the number of video customers that a single cable operator can serve nationwide the fcc may initiate consideration of a new ownership limit however even without the adoption of a new ownership limit federal regulators including the fcc and the federal trade commission “ftc” andor the department of justice could refuse to approve certain transactions that increase the number of video customers we serve 

the fcc is assessing whether it should revise a limit on the number of affiliated programming networks that a cable operator may carry on its cable systems while the fcc’s previous limit of 

40 of the first 75 channels was struck down by a federal appellate court in 2001 the fcc continues to enforce the previous limit the percentage of affiliated programming networks we currently carry is well below the previous limit we expect to be able to comply with the previous limit if our transaction with nbc universal closes but compliance could become more difficult depending on what regulations the fcc adopts if any 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations and policies limit the prices that cable operators may charge for basic service whether transmitted in analog or digital equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition or where local or state franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates as a result 75 of our customers are not subject to rate regulation and as of december 31 2009 we have pending before the fcc additional petitions for determination of effective competition for systems covering another 12 of our customers from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings as discussed under “legal proceedings” in item 3 we and others are currently involved in litigation that could force us and other multichannel video programming distributors to offer programming networks on an a la carte basis additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for retransmission consent which may enable popular stations to demand cash payments or other significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks affiliated with the broadcaster as a condition of transmitting the tv broadcast signals that video customers expect to receive now that broadcasters have completed their transition from analog to digital technology cable operators generally are required to carry the primary digital programming stream of local broadcast stations as well as an analog version of the primary digital programming stream on systems that are not all digital these requirements are scheduled to last until june 12 2012 subject to possible extensions the fcc has provided a limited exemption from these requirements for cable systems with an activated channel capacity of 552 mhz or less under this exemption which applies to certain of our cable systems the operator is only obligated to carry an 

  

   

analog version of the broadcaster’s primary digital programming stream the fcc may consider expanding mustcarry rights in the future such expanded mustcarry obligations could affect our ability to allocate bandwidth to provide more hdtv programming and on demand services faster internet speeds and other services 

program accessprogram carriagelicense agreements 

the communications act and the fcc’s program access rules generally prevent video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video programming distributors such as dbs providers and phone companies that offer multichannel video services and limit the ability of such affiliated programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2012 we have joined a challenge to this fcc action in federal court in addition the communications act and the fcc’s program carriage rules prohibit cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is considering proposals to expand its program access and program carriage regulations the adoption of one or more of these proposals could have an adverse effect on our businesses in january 2010 the fcc adopted new rules that allow multichannel video programming distributors to file program access complaints to try to show that their lack of access to a terrestriallydelivered programming network has hindered significantly their ability to deliver video programming to subscribers the rules are not yet in effect and it is not yet clear whether and to what extent this will affect our terrestrially delivered regional sports network in philadelphia in addition under the fcc’s order that approved our acquisition of adelphia cable systems and related time warner transactions in july 2006 multichannel video programming distributors may invoke commercial arbitration against our regional sports networks as an alternative to filing a program access complaint with the fcc until july 2012 we have been and from time to time continue to be involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc and may continue to be subject to such disputes adverse decisions in any such future disputes could increase our costs and curtail our flexibility to deliver services to our customers 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator while we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access to date the fcc adopted rules in 2007 that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although the reduced rates initially will not apply to home shopping 

or infomercial programmers the fcc issued a further notice to determine if such programming should also have the benefit of the reduced rates implementation of these fcc rules however has been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and also has been blocked by the office of management and budget if implemented these rules could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such rules 

cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services these regulations prohibit cable operators from acquiring for deployment settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions as a result settop boxes that we purchase must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard which adds to the cost of settop boxes in addition the fcc has adopted rules aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets that can connect directly to a cable network and receive oneway analog and digital video services without the need for a settop box the fcc is also considering proposals to establish regulations for plugandplay retail devices that can access twoway cable services and may also examine proposals affecting the marketplace for retail devices that can deliver multichannel video programming distributors and internet content to consumers some of these alternative approaches if adopted could impose substantial costs on us and impair our ability to innovate in 2009 the fcc granted waivers of its separate security rule for certain settop box models of oneway standarddefinition dtas we believe that dtas are critical to our all digital conversion dtas enable us to convert analog channels to digital transmission which requires less bandwidth and to use the recaptured bandwidth capacity for more hdtv programming and on demand services faster internet speeds and other services the fcc order that established the waiver process for the dtas is subject to a petition for reconsideration at the fcc we cannot predict the extent to which any fcc reconsideration or other fcc action in this area may hinder our ability to continue deploying dtas 

mdus and inside wiring 

under an fcc order exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus or other private real estate developments are prohibited in may 2009 a federal appellate court upheld the fcc order which had been challenged by the national cable  telecommunications association the fcc is also considering proposals to extend these prohibitions to noncable multichannel video programming distributors and to expand the scope of the rules to prohibit exclusive marketing and bulk billing agreements the fcc’s order to abrogate the exclusivity provisions of those agreements could negatively affect 

  

   

our business as would adoption of new limits on exclusive marketing and bulk billing the fcc has also adopted rules facilitating competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such mdus these rules could also have an adverse impact on our business as they allow our competitors to use wiring we have deployed to reach potential customers more quickly and inexpensively 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rates that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole attachment rate standards the fcc or a state could increase pole attachment rates paid by cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we could face materially higher pole attachment costs in august 2009 utility companies initiated a proceeding at the fcc seeking to apply the telecommunications services pole rate to all poles over which cable operators provide phone services using interconnected voip technology which is the type of technology we use for our phone services if the fcc rules that the provision of such phone services requires application of the telecommunications services pole rate our payments for pole attachments would increase significantly in addition to the utility company proceeding the fcc separately has been considering establishing a new unified pole attachment rate that would apply to cable system attachments where the cable operator provides highspeed internet services and perhaps phone services as well the proposed rate would be higher than the current rate paid by cable operators but lower than the telecommunications services pole rate that the utility companies are seeking to apply to our pole attachments if adopted this proposal could materially increase our costs by increasing our existing payments for pole attachments 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions 

governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

over the past few years there has been considerable activity at both the federal and state levels addressing franchise requirements imposed on new entrants primarily directed at facilitating phone companies’ entry into cable services under fcc rules adopted in 2006 the franchising process and burdens for new entrants have been eased by among other things limiting the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants requiring franchising authorities to act on franchise applications by new entrants within 90 days and preempting certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements the fcc subsequently adopted more modest franchising relief for existing cable operators we believe that we have been and continue to be materially disadvantaged as a result of these fcc rules which apply less burdensome franchising standards to certain types of our competitors from time to time congress has also considered proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for phone companies and other new entrants we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what effect it would have on our business 

in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants thus relieving new entrants of many of the local franchising burdens faced by incumbent cable operators like us some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these state statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent cable operator’s franchise area however even in those states where incumbent cable operators are allowed to opt into a state franchise the incumbent cable operators often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the copyright office has issued a report to congress in which it recommended eliminating the compulsory copyright license in favor of free market negotiations between cable operators and copyright owners if adopted this 

  

   

proposal could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs in may 2008 the copyright office rejected a cable industry request to clarify that copyright fees associated with the retransmission of outofmarket broadcast signals should be limited to system customers who actually receive those signals the copyright office concluded it did not have authority under the governing statute to adopt that interpretation there is a risk that the copyright office’s determination on this issue could materially increase the copyright royalty fees that we and other cable operators pay to retransmit outofmarket broadcast signals further in june 2008 the copyright office issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in this notice the copyright office proposed to require royalty fees from cable operators for carriage of each digital multicast stream of programming from an outofmarket television broadcast station if adopted this proposal could increase our royalty fees for the carriage of outofmarket television stations currently we do not carry a significant number of multicast streams of programming from outofmarket stations although our carriage of such programming streams may increase in the future legislation is pending in congress that if passed would address each of the copyright office matters 

in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create including our cable segment’s local advertising and local origination programming and our programming segment’s original programs these licensing fees have been the source of litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future

we provide highspeed internet services over our cable systems in 2002 the fcc ruled that this was an interstate information service that is not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

the fcc has proposed adopting socalled “net neutrality” rules that would define certain rights for users of highspeed internet services and regulate or restrict some types of commercial agreements between service providers and providers of internet content in 2005 the fcc issued what was characterized at the time as a nonbinding policy statement identifying four “principles” of internet openness that would guide its policymaking regarding highspeed internet and related services in 2009 the fcc pro  

posed to convert these “principles” into enforceable regulations and expand them the proposed regulations would bar highspeed internet service providers such as us from preventing any consumer from i sending or receiving the lawful content of the consumer’s choice over the internet ii running the lawful applications or using the lawful services of the consumer’s choice iii connecting to and using on its network the consumer’s choice of lawful devices that do not harm the network and iv enjoying competition among network providers application providers service providers and content providers in addition the proposed regulations would add an obligation to treat lawful content applications and service in a nondiscriminatory manner and a duty to disclose such information concerning network management and other practices as is reasonably required for consumers and content application and service providers to enjoy the protections specified in the regulations the proposed regulations also would allow for reasonable network management by highspeed internet service providers such as us subject to fcc oversight the fcc also has raised the possibility of adopting additional rules that would govern or restrict our offering of “managed services” although the definition of such term and proposed scope of any such rules cannot yet be determined legislation has been introduced in congress that would impose similar requirements on our provision of highspeed internet services any net neutrality rules or statutes could limit our ability to manage not only our highspeed internet services but all of our cable services which could adversely affect our ability to provide video and phone services further any net neutrality rules or statutes could hinder our ability to obtain adequate value for use of our cable services or to respond to competitive conditions even in the absence of new net neutrality rules our highspeed internet services may be subject to ad hoc enforcement actions by the fcc for example in august 2008 the fcc found that we had violated “federal internet policies” by engaging in certain network management practices intended to address congestion on our highspeed internet network we are challenging that decision in federal court 

the fcc also is currently developing a “national broadband plan” which could result in new regulatory proposals for or new competition to our highspeed internet services meanwhile the departments of agriculture and commerce are awarding significant grants and loans to providers of internet services which may increase the competition we face 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on their revenue from their services in recent years approximately 11 of interstate revenue from our phone services into a fund the universal service fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers congress and the fcc are considering proposals that could result in our highspeed internet services being subject to universal service fees and that could 

  

   

also result in subsidies being provided to our internet and video competitors we cannot predict whether or how the universal service funding system might be extended to cover highspeed internet services or if that occurs how it will affect us 

in addition congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy consumer protection copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments have also adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are also considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

phone services 

 

we provide voice services by using interconnected voip technology which we refer to as our phone services in this annual report on form 10k the fcc has adopted a number of orders addressing regulatory issues relating to providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 calea and contributions to the federal universal service fund but has not yet ruled on the appropriate classification of phone services using interconnected voip technology the regulatory environment for our phone services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and the state levels until the fcc definitively classifies phone services using interconnected voip technology for state and federal regulatory purposes state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our phone services 

because the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of our phone services the precise scope of phone company interconnection rules applicable to us as a provider of nontraditional voice services is not entirely clear in light of this uncertainty providers of nontraditional voice services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs and through third party clecs while some traditional wireline phone companies have challenged our right to interconnect directly with them we have prevailed in almost all of these challenges if a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our clecs our ability to provide 

phone services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted 

it is uncertain whether the fcc or congress will adopt further rules regarding interconnection rights and arrangements and how such rules would affect our phone services 

in addition a few state public utility commissions are conducting proceedings that could lead to the imposition of state telephone regulations upon our phone services and we could incur additional costs in complying with any such regulations 

other areas 

 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable segment and limited aspects of our programming segment including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards political advertising indecent or obscene programming emergency alert system requirements for analog and digital services closed captioning requirements for the hearing impaired commercial restrictions on children’s programming origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator sponsorship identification equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable network and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and programming businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc rules we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video highspeed internet and phone services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors and other competitors that deliver their services over a highspeed internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are 

  

   

exceptions that permit the collection and disclosure of this information for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the telecommunications act of 1996 provides additional privacy protections for customer proprietary network information commonly known as cpni related to our digital phone services a handful of states and the district of columbia have enacted privacy laws that apply to cable services the ftc has begun to exercise greater authority over privacy protections generally using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive practices and other public proceedings to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers the fcc also is seeking public comments on how and whether it should address broadband privacy issues in a notice of inquiry for a national broadband plan further certain key congressional committees and lawmakers have expressed an intention to introduce legislation to expand privacyrelated regulation 

we are also subject to state and federal rules and laws regarding information security most of these rules and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft fortyfive states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach the ftc is applying the “red flag rules” in the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 to both financial institutions and creditors and the ftc’s interpretation of the rules considers us to be a creditor we intend to comply with these rules which are currently scheduled to become effective for us on june 1 2010 by using an identity theft prevention program to identify detect and respond to patterns practices or specific activities that could indicate identity theft 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 107000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 89000 were associated with our cable business and the remainder were associated with our programming and other businesses approximately 6000 of our employees including parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

  

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that those statements are only our predictions in evaluating those statements you should specifically consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “ risk factors” under item 1a and in other reports we file with the sec 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from our forwardlooking statements or as a result of any of such factors which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

our cable services currently face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we operate in intensely competitive industries we compete with a number of companies that provide a broad range of news and entertainment programming and information and communication services to consumers while competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and phone companies we also directly compete against other providers of cable services including companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities that we serve satellite master antenna television systems and other companies that offer programming and other communications services including highspeed internet and phone services to our customers and potential customers in 2009 phone companies continued to expand their service areas which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas and our primary competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer moreover in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted 

  

   

regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 for additional information in addition while we continue to seek ways to enhance and expand our existing products and services such as by employing addressable advertising and offering commercial services there can be no assurance that we can execute on these enhancements or expansions in a manner sufficient to compete successfully in the future also our ability to compete effectively is in part dependent upon our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies including our customers investors and governmental authorities our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

technological advances have increased and will likely continue to increase competition for our cable services which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we operate in a technologically complex environment where the use of certain types of technology may provide our competitors with a competitive advantage for example cable operators may employ different technologies in their efforts to recapture bandwidth to allow for more hdtv programming and on demand services faster internet speeds and other services for customers also in some cases phone companies are using ip technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future if we choose technology that is not as effective costefficient or attractive to customers as that employed by our competitors if we fail to employ technologies desired by our customers before our competitors do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

moreover new technologies have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and our advertising business for example new services and technologies that may compete with our video services include online services that offer internet video streaming downloading and distribution of movies television shows and other video programming and wireless and other emerging mobile technologies that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming newer services in wireless internet technology such as third and fourth generation wireless broadband services may compete with our highspeed internet services and our phone services are facing increased competition from wireless phone services as more people choose to replace their traditional wireline phone service with wireless phone service moreover some of our phone company competitors have their own wireless facilities which we do not have and have expanded or may expand their cable service bundle offerings to include wireless offerings which may adversely affect our growth business and results of operations the success of 

any of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

programming expenses are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future the multichannel video programming distribution industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers we incur increased programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations moreover as our programming contracts with programming providers expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands including demands for cash payments and other concessions by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our customers we cannot predict the magnitude of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we concede to certain of these demands or fail to obtain the required consents 

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose additional costs and restrictions 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and voip digital phone service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws congress is constantly considering new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business and results of operations 

in addition local franchising authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition of renewal or transfer and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in addition we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if phone companies that provide video services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us 

  

   

for example the fcc has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 and refer to the “franchising” discussion within that section 

we also face other risks related to federal state and local regulations for example congress and the fcc are also considering various forms of “net neutrality” regulation see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 and refer to the “highspeed internet services” discussion within that section for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with our regulation by federal state and local governments see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 

weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

weak economic conditions persisted during 2009 and a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions to the extent these weak economic conditions continue customers may reduce the advanced or premium services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be worsened by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as video streaming over the internet or substitute services such as wireless phones the weak economy negatively affected our net customer additions during 2009 and also had a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable and programming segments if these weak economic conditions continue or deteriorate our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we rely on network and information systems and other technology and a disruption or failure of such networks systems or technology may disrupt our business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to our network management and customer service operations are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our cable services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment and data these network and information systemsrelated events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital 

and other resources to remedy any such security breach the occurrence of any such network or information systemsrelated events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services moreover some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they otherwise cannot meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected in which case our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties to use our technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our business moreover because of the rapid pace of technological change we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those referred to in “legal proceedings” in item 3 and those arising in the ordinary course of business including regulatory and administrative proceedings claims and audits while we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will 

  

   

have a material effect on our financial condition an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be timeconsuming costly and injure our reputation further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial condition 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition in connection with our proposed nbc universal transaction with ge we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory and governmental approvals to consummate the transaction on acceptable terms or predict whether any conditions that may be imposed on our businesses in permitting the transaction to occur would have an adverse effect on our businesses further we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete a committed financing of nbc universal on currently contemplated terms including that the new company will receive an investment grade credit rating from the debt rating agencies moreover assuming the nbc universal transaction is consummated there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate our programming assets with those of nbc universal create popular programming develop new digital products and services or succeed in the highly competitive media industry 

also as noted in more detail in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we are required to pay to ge at the closing of this transaction 71 billion in cash less certain adjustments primarily based on the free cash flow generated by nbc universal between december 4 2009 and the closing and we have committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or common stock for each of two potential redemptions by ge for an aggregate of up to 575 billion with amounts not used for the first redemption to be available for the second redemption to the extent the new company cannot fund the redemptions there can be no assurance that the new company will be able to generate strong cash flows or attractive financial returns 

  

the loss of key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses while we maintain longterm and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our business 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other stockholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other stockholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock 

brian l roberts beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our operations and the ability subject to certain restrictions through november 17 2012 to transfer potential effective control by selling the class b common stock in addition under our articles of incorporation mr roberts is entitled to remain as our chairman chief executive officer and president until may 26 2010 unless he is removed by the affirmative vote of at least 75 of the entire board of directors or he is no longer willing or able to serve

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

 

we are a leading provider of video highspeed internet and phone services “cable services” offering a variety of entertainment information and communications services to residential and commercial customers as of december 31 2009 our cable systems served approximately 236 million video customers 159 million highspeed internet customers and 76 million phone customers and passed over 512 million homes and businesses in 39 states and the district of columbia we report the results of these operations as our cable segment which generates approximately 95 of our consolidated revenue our cable segment also includes the operations of our regional sports networks our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks during 2009 our operations generated consolidated revenue of approximately  358 billion 

our cable segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services in addition to cable services other cable segment revenue sources include the sale of advertising and the operation of our regional sports networks we market our cable services individually and in packages our video services range from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels on demand music channels and an interactive onscreen program guide digital video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services which consist of highdefinition television “hdtv” andor digital video recorders “dvr” our highspeed internet services provide internet access at downstream speeds of up to 50 mbps depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability our phone services provide local and longdistance calling and other features we also offer our cable services to small and mediumsized businesses “commercial services” 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks e golf channel versus g4 and style revenue from our programming segment is generated primarily from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers the sale of advertising and the licensing of our programming internationally 

our other business interests include comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor comcast interactive media develops and operates our internet businesses including comcastnet fancast theplatform fandango plaxo and dailycandy revenue from comcast interactive media is generated primarily from the sale of advertising comcast spectacor owns two professional sports teams the philadelphia 76ers and the philadelphia flyers and a 

large multipurpose arena in philadelphia the wachovia center and provides facilities management services including food services for sporting events concerts and other events comcast interactive media comcast spectacor and all other consolidated businesses not included in our cable or programming segments are included in “corporate and other” activities 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and phone companies in 2009 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer in addition a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions intensifying competition and the weak economy negatively affected our results of operations in 2009 and may continue to impact our results of operations in the future 

2009 developments 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

   

  

  

 nbc universal transaction

consolidated revenue 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated revenue for 2009 and 2008 our other business activities primarily consist of comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor cable segment revenue and programming segment revenue are discussed separately in “segment operating results” 

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for 2009 and 2008 the remaining changes related to our other business activities primarily comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor and approximately 20 million of transaction fees associated with the nbc universal 

transaction cable segment and programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses are discussed separately in “segment operating results” 

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

the increases in depreciation expense for 2009 and 2008 were primarily a result of increases in property and equipment associated with capital spending in recent years as well as the effects of cable system acquisitions in 2008 which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately 138 million 

the increase in amortization expense for 2009 was primarily due to an increase in software intangibles the decrease in amortization expense for 2008 was primarily due to intangible assets associated with the att broadband acquisition in 2002 being fully amortized partially offset by the amortization of similar intangible assets recorded in connection with other cable system acquisitions 

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information to measure the performance of our operating segments we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in 

  

   

business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss attributable to comcast corporation net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

  

cable segment overview 

 

our cable systems allow us to deliver video highspeed internet and phone services to our residential and commercial customers the majority of our cable segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to these cable services customers are billed monthly based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time while commercial customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts which typically have one to three year terms our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of continued demand for our services including our bundled and advanced service offerings and the effects of recent acquisitions as well as other factors discussed below intensifying competition and the weak economy negatively affected our results of operations in 2009 and may continue to impact our results of operations in the future 

  

 

cable segment results of operations 

 

 a reclassifications have been made to prior years to conform to classifications used in 2009 

  

   

cable segment revenue 

our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to approximately 118 in 2009 from approximately 111 in 2008 and approximately 102 in 2007 the increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer are primarily due to an increased number of customers receiving multiple services and a higher contribution from our commercial services business 

video 

we offer video services ranging from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels as of december 31 2009 approximately 46 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services as of december 31 2009 approximately 78 of those video customers subscribed to at least one of our digital video services compared to 70 and 63 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively digital video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services hdtv andor dvr as of december 31 2009 approximately 50 of our digital video customers subscribed to at least one of our advanced services 

our video revenue continued to grow in 2009 and 2008 due to rate adjustments customer upgrades to our digital and advanced services and in 2008 the effects of cable system acquisitions partially offset by declines in video customers in each of 2009 and 2008 during 2009 and 2008 the number of video customers decreased by approximately 623000 and 575000 respectively excluding the effects of cable system acquisitions in 2008 these decreases were primarily due to increased competition in our service areas as well as weakness in the economy during 2009 and 2008 we added or upgraded approximately 14 million and 15 million customers to our digital video service respectively including those customers added or upgraded in connection with our all digital conversion we expect continued competition and weak economic conditions to result in further declines in the number of video customers during 2010 in 2008 approximately 455 million of the increase in our video revenue was attributable to the effects of cable system acquisitions our average monthly 

video revenue per video customer increased to approximately 68 in 2009 from approximately 65 in 2008 and approximately 61 in 2007 

highspeed internet 

we offer highspeed internet services with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 50 mbps depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability these services also include our internet portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet services we provide our commercial highspeed internet service also includes a website hosting service and an online tool that allows customers to share coordinate and store documents as of december 31 2009 31 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services compared to 30 and 28 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our highspeed internet revenue increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential and commercial customers and in 2008 due to the effects of cable system acquisitions in 2008 approximately 157 million of the increase in revenue was attributable to the effects of cable system acquisitions average monthly revenue per highspeed internet customer has been relatively stable at approximately 42 from 2007 to 2009 

phone 

we offer phone services that provide local and longdistance calling and include features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting our commercial phone service also includes a business directory listing and the option to add multiple phone lines as of december 31 2009 our phone services were available to approximately 48 million or 95 of the homes in the areas we serve compared to 92 and 87 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 31 2009 approximately 16 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our phone services 

  

   

compared to 14 and 11 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our phone revenue increased in 2009 and 2008 as a result of increases in the number of residential and commercial phone customers in 2008 these increases were partially offset by the loss of approximately 170000 circuitswitched phone customers we phased out substantially all of our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 in 2008 approximately 43 million of the increase in our phone revenue was attributable to the effects of cable system acquisitions average monthly revenue per phone customer declined to approximately 39 in 2009 from approximately 40 in 2008 and approximately 42 in 2007 due to customers receiving service as part of a promotional offer or in a bundled service offering we expect the rates of customer and revenue growth to decline in 2010 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers in most cases the available advertising time is sold by our sales force in some cases we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects these interconnects establish a physical direct link between multiple providers for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator our prior practice had been to record the fees we pay to representation firms and other multichannel video providers as a revenue offset however since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements and as these coordination and interconnect activities are expected to grow in significance we have concluded that we should report the fees paid to representation firms and multichannel video providers as an operating expense rather than as a revenue offset accordingly we changed the presentation for these items for 2008 and 2007 

and classified approximately 167 million and 165 million respectively of the fees paid as operating expenses 

advertising revenue decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a decline in the overall television advertising market as a result of weak economic conditions in 2009 the decrease also resulted from a decline in political advertising while the decrease in 2008 was partially offset by an increase in political advertising and the impact of cable system acquisitions 

other 

we also generate revenue from our regional sports networks our digital media center commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees for other services our regional sports networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet northwest portland comcast sports southwest houston and comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco these networks generate revenue from programming license agreements with multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising 

franchise fees 

our franchise fee revenue represents the passthrough to our customers of the fees required to be paid to state and local franchising authorities under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the increases in franchise fees collected from our cable customers in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to increases in the revenue on which the fees apply 

cable segment expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margins operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 404 404 and 405 respectively 

  

   

cable segment operating expenses 

 

 a reclassifications have been made to prior years to conform to classifications used in 2009 

 

video programming expenses our largest operating expense are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we distribute to our video customers these expenses are affected by changes in the fees charged by programming networks the number of video customers we serve and the number of channels and programs we provide video programming expenses increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to rate increases additional digital customers and additional programming options offered the increase in 2009 was also due to fees for retransmission of broadcast networks the increase in 2008 was also due to additional customers as a result of our cable system acquisitions we anticipate that our video programming expenses will continue to increase in 2010 as the fees charged by programming networks increase as new fees for retransmission of broadcast networks are incurred and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our customers 

technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor to complete service call and installation activities in the home network operations fulfillment and provisioning costs these expenses increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to growth in the number of customers which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide inhome customer support as well as activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from 

analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion and in 2008 due to the effects of cable system acquisitions 

highspeed internet expenses and phone expenses include certain direct costs for providing these services but do not fully reflect the amount of operating expenses that would be necessary to provide these services on a standalone basis other related costs associated with providing these services are generally shared among all our cable services and are not allocated to these items the decreases in highspeed internet expenses in 2009 and 2008 and phone expenses in 2009 were primarily due to lower support service costs that were the result of operating efficiencies phone expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to an increase in the number of customers partially offset by operational efficiencies 

other operating expenses include franchise fees pole rentals plant maintenance vehiclerelated costs expenses related to our regional sports networks advertising representation and commission fees and expenses associated with our commercial services these expenses increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the continued expansion of commercial services an increase in franchise fees and in 2008 the effects of cable system acquisitions and the acquisitions in june 2007 of comcast sportsnet bay area and comcast sportsnet new england 

 

cable segment selling general and administrative expenses 

 

   

   

customer service expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission during the first half of the year and our all digital conversion customer service expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to growth in the number of customers 

marketing expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower costs and volume for media advertising partially offset by an increase in direct sales efforts marketing expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining customers as well as the effects of cable system acquisitions 

  

during 2009 and 2008 we implemented personnel and cost reduction programs that were focused on streamlining our cable operations in connection with these initiatives we recorded 81 million and 126 million of severance costs during 2009 and 2008 respectively administrative and other expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of the programs initiated in 2008 administrative and other expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to the effects of cable system acquisitions 

 

programming segment overview 

 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks the table below presents a summary of our consolidated national programming networks 

 

 we also own noncontrolling interests in certain networks and content providers including fearnet 33 in demand 54 mgm 20 pbs kids sprout 40 and tv one 34 the operating results of these entities are not included in our programming segment’s operating results because they are presented in equity in net income losses of affiliates 

programming segment results of operations 

 

  

programming segment revenue 

programming revenue increased in 2009 primarily due to growth in programming license fee revenue and a favorable adjustment to advertising revenue as a result of reduced reserves for ratings commitments programming revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to growth in advertising revenue programming license fee revenue and international revenue in 2009 2008 and 2007 advertising accounted for approximately 41 43 and 44 respectively of total programming revenue in 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 12 to 13 of our programming revenue was generated from our cable segment these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

  

programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses 

programming operating selling general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events the purchase of programming rights the marketing and promotion of our programming networks and administrative costs we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new and liveevent programming that will cause our programming expenses to increase in the future 

  

  

   

consolidated other income expense items 

 

 

 interest expense 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 interest expense included 175 million 64 million and 2 million respectively of early extinguishment losses net of early extinguishment gains associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity the decrease in interest expense for 2009 was primarily due to the decrease in our average debt outstanding and decreases in interest rates on our variable rate debt and on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements partially offset by an increase in early extinguishment costs in 2009 the increase in interest expense for 2008 was primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding and an increase in early extinguishment costs in 2008 partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates on our fixed to variable rate interest rate exchange agreements 

investment income loss net 

the components of investment income loss net for 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and substantially all of our investments accounted for as available for sale securities the differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements as presented in the table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

other income expense 

other expense for 2008 includes an impairment of approximately 600 million related to our investment in clearwire llc see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements partially offset by a gain of approximately 235 million on the sale of our 50 interest in the insight asset pool in connection with the insight transaction other income for 2007 consists primarily of a gain of approximately 500 million on the sale of our 50 interest in the kansas city asset pool in connection with the houston transaction 

income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2009 2008 and 2007 was 289 378 and 414 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions our 2009 income tax expense was reduced by approximately 566 million primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with settlements and adjustments of uncertain tax positions and related interest and certain subsidiary reorganizations impacting deferred state income taxes see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements our 2008 income tax expense was reduced by approximately 154 million primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position and the net impact of certain state tax law changes which primarily affected our deferred income tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and the future deductibility of certain deferred compensation arrangements our income tax expense may in the future continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in state tax laws we expect our 2010 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 40 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing 

we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities to meet our debt repayment obligations and to return capital to investors 

we traditionally maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2009 amounts available under all of our credit facilities totaled approximately 64 billion 

  

   

we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital we test our compliance with our credit facilities’ covenants on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in our 68 billion revolving credit facility due 2013 pertains to leverage ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2009 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin our ability to comply with this financial covenant in the future does not depend on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 

in connection with our nbc universal transaction we are required to make a cash payment to ge of 71 billion less certain adjustments primarily based on free cash flow generated by nbc universal between december 4 2009 and the closing of the nbc universal transaction we expect to fund this payment with cash on hand and through a combination of available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and issuance of debt to the public or third party lenders any future redemptions of ge’s stake in the new company are expected to be funded primarily through cash flows and borrowing capacity of the new company if any borrowings by the new company to fund either of ge’s two potential redemptions would result in the new company exceeding a certain leverage ratio or the new company losing investment grade status or if the new company cannot otherwise fund such redemptions we are committed to fund up to 2875 billion in cash or common stock for each of the two potential redemptions for an aggregate of up to 575 billion with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption 

  

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 the increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2009 relates to an increase in accounts receivable and the timing of payments of operating items and payroll 

the decrease in interest payments in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements the effects of our debt repayments and to the maturity of certain higher rate debt in 2008 the increases in interest payments in 2008 were primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding 

the increase in income tax payments in 2009 was primarily due to higher 2009 taxable income the settlements of uncertain tax positions and a tax payment made in 2009 that related to 2008 partially offset by the net benefits of approximately 341 million from the 2008 and 2009 economic stimulus legislation the decrease in income tax payments in 2008 was primarily due to the 2008 economic stimulus legislation which resulted in a reduction in our tax payments of approximately 600 million 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures intangible assets acquisitions and investments 

  

   

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable segment and we expect that this will continue in the future a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment from 2007 through 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 cable capital expenditures decreased 92 and 75 in 2009 and 2008 respectively primarily due to fewer residential unit additions and improved equipment pricing partially offset by an increased investment in our commercial services and strategic initiatives like our all digital conversion and docsis 30 wideband technology line extensions decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the slowdown in the housing market 

capital expenditures in our programming segment were not significant in 2009 2008 or 2007 in 2008 and 2007 our other 

business activities included approximately 137 million and 110 million respectively of capital expenditures related to the consolidation of offices and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 

capital expenditures for 2010 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services 

acquisitions 

our 2009 acquisitions were not significant in 2008 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisition of an additional interest in comcast sportsnet bay area our acquisition of the remaining interest in g4 that we did not already own and our acquisitions of plaxo and dailycandy in 2007 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisitions of patriot media fandango comcast sportsnet new england and an interest in comcast sportsnet bay area 

proceeds from sales of investments 

in 2008 proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of availableforsale debt securities in 2007 proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of our ownership interests in time warner inc 

purchases of investments 

in 2009 purchases of investments consist primarily of our additional investment in clearwire in 2008 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the funding of our initial investment in clearwire in 2007 purchases of investments consisted primarily of an additional investment in insight midwest lp and the purchase of availableforsale debt securities 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of our debt repayments our repurchases of our class a and class a special common stock and dividend payments partially offset by our proceeds from borrowings proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments 

in july 2009 we completed a cash tender to purchase approximately 13 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes for approximately 15 billion we recognized additional interest expense of approximately 180 million primarily associated with the premiums incurred in the tender offer the premiums related to the tender offer are included in other financing activities 

we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions in 2009 

  

   

and 2008 we made 1616 billion and 307 million respectively of optional purchases of our outstanding public bonds and zones debt see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

  

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced services and highspeed internet and phone services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed its fair value “impairment testing” we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information 

if we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights is less than the carrying amount we would recognize an impairment for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our cable divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level 

since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairments as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment 

we could also record impairments in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual 

impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from 

  

   

those determined in the july 1 2009 annual impairment testing the table below illustrates the impairment related to our cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing 

 

 income taxes 

we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty in these cases we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including 

consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period as of december 31 2009 our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were approximately 1185 billion and 519 million respectively 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of december 31 2009 approximately 997 of our total debt of 291 billion was at fixed rates with the remaining debt at variable rates we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

  

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which can include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 997 to 869 as of december 31 2009 in 2009 and 2008 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of approximately 104 million and 34 million respectively in 2007 the effect was an increase in our interest expense of approximately 43 million interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

  

 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2009 

 

   

   

we use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the payments necessary or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate “libor” for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2009 plus the applicable margin in effect on december 31 2009 

as a matter of practice we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of 26 million and an asset of 44 million respectively the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time 

  

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments 

except as described above in “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading or available for sale securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 6 and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our derivative financial instruments

general developments of our businesses 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses in 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

   

 we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and phone companies in 2008 our competitors continued to add features 

and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer and the local phone companies have continued to expand their service areas a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net customer additions in 2008 and may if these conditions continue adversely impact our results of operations in the future 

 

description of our businesses 

cable segment 

 

the table below summarizes certain customer and penetration data for our cable operations as of december 31 

 

 basis of presentation information related to cable system acquisitions is included from the date acquired information related to cable systems sold or exchanged is excluded for all periods presented all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

  

  

  

  

   

   

cable services 

we offer a variety of services over our cable systems including video highspeed internet and phone services “cable services” and market these services individually and in packages substantially all of our customers are residential customers we have traditionally offered our video services to restaurants and hotels and we are now offering our cable services to small and mediumsized businesses monthly subscription rates and related charges vary according to the service selected and the type of equipment the customer uses and customers typically pay us on a monthly basis while residential customers may discontinue services at any time business customers may only discontinue their services in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts which typically have one to three year terms 

we are focusing our technology initiatives on extending the capacity and efficiency of our networks increasing the capacity and functionality of advanced settop boxes developing and integrating crossservice features and functionality and developing interactive services 

video services 

our video service offerings range from a limited analog service to a full digital service as well as advanced services including highdefinition television “hdtv” and digital video recorder “dvr” we tailor our channel offerings for each system serving a particular geographic area according to applicable local and federal regulatory requirements programming preferences and demographics 

our video services consist of a limited analog service which generally includes access to between 20 and 40 channels of programming an expanded analog service which generally includes access to between 60 and 80 channels of programming and digital video services with access to over 250 channels depending on the level of service selected our video services generally include programming provided by national and local broadcast networks national and regional cable networks and governmental and public access programming our digital video services generally include access to multiple music channels our on demand service and an interactive onscreen program guide we also offer some specialty tiers with sports family or international themes 

our video customers may also subscribe to premium channel programming premium channels include cable networks such as hbo showtime starz and cinemax which generally offer without commercial interruption movies original programming live and taped sporting events concerts and other special features 

our on demand service allows our digital video customers the opportunity to choose from a selection of more than 10000 standarddefinition and highdefinition programs over the course of a month start the programs at whatever time is convenient and pause rewind and fastforward the programs the majority of our 

on demand content is available to our digital video customers at no additional charge with additional content available on a payperview basis digital video customers subscribing to premium channels generally have access to the premium channel’s on demand content without additional fees our payperview on demand service allows our video customers to order for a separate fee individual new release and library movies and specialevent programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts we are continuing to expand the number of on demand choices including hdtv programming 

video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services hdtv and dvr our hdtv service provides our video customers with improved highresolution picture quality improved audio quality and a widescreen format our hdtv service offers our digital video customers a broad selection of highdefinition programming including most major broadcast networks leading national cable networks premium channels and regional sports networks in addition our on demand service provides over 1000 hdtv programming choices we are continuing to expand our hdtv programming choices our dvr service lets digital video customers select record and store programs and play them at whatever time is convenient our dvr service also provides the ability to pause and rewind “live” television 

highspeed internet services 

we offer highspeed internet services with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 24 mbps depending on the service selected and up to 50 mbps with the introduction of docsis 30 technology also referred to as wideband based on geographic market availability these services also include our interactive portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet services we provide 

phone services 

we offer a voice over internet protocol “voip” digital phone service that provides either usagebased or unlimited local and domestic longdistance calling including features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting we phased out substantially all of our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we often receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects these interconnects establish a physical direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable company we are also in the process of developing technology for interactive advertising 

  

   

regional sports networks 

our regional sports networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet northwest portland and comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco these networks generate revenue from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising time 

other revenue sources 

we also generate revenue from our digital media center installation services commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services 

sources of supply 

to offer our video services we license from programming networks the substantial majority of the programming channels and the associated on demand offerings we distribute and we generally pay a monthly fee for such programming on a per video subscriber per channel basis we attempt to secure longterm programming licenses with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives we also license individual programs or packages of programs from programming suppliers for our on demand service generally under shorterterm agreements 

our video programming expenses depend on the number of our video customers the number of channels and programs we provide and the programming license fees we are charged we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item and to increase in the future 

we purchase a significant number of the settop boxes and network equipment from a limited number of suppliers that we use in providing our video services 

for our highspeed internet portal comcastnet we license software products such as email and security software and content such as news feeds from a variety of suppliers under contracts in which we generally pay on a fixedfee basis or on a per customer basis in the case of software product licenses or on a video advertising revenue share basis in the case of content licenses 

to offer our phone services we license software products such as voice mail from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts the fees we pay are based on the consumption of the related services 

in connection with our provision of cable services we license all of our billing software from two vendors 

  

customer and technical services 

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers these call centers provide 247 callanswering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services group performs various tasks including installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

technology 

our cable systems employ a network architecture of hybrid fiber coax that we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future requirements this network allows the twoway delivery of transmissions which is essential to providing interactive video services such as on demand and highspeed internet and digital phone services 

we continue to work on technology initiatives including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

   

sales and marketing 

we offer our products and services directly to customers through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising television advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets we also market our video highspeed internet and digital phone services individually and as bundled services 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment we compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and local phone companies in 2008 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer and the local phone companies have continued to expand their service areas these competitive factors have had an impact on and are likely to continue to affect our results of operations in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment where it is likely that new technologies will further increase the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and for our advertising business we expect advances in communications technology such as video streaming over the internet to continue in the future and we are unable to predict what effects these developments will have on our businesses and operations 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news sports information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by local phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings furthermore the fcc and various state governments have adopted measures that reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including local phone companies certain of these franchising entry measures have already been adopted in many states in which we operate we could be materially disadvantaged if fcc and state franchising rules continue to set a different less burdensome standard for some of our competitors than for ourselves see “legislation and regulation” below 

direct broadcast satellite systems 

according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to over 35 million customers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 250 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and dish network provide service to substantially all of these dbs customers 

highpower satellite service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outdoor antennas satellite systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their customers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals currently delivered to customers by dbs providers 

federal legislation establishes among other things a compulsory copyright license that permits satellite systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to customers who reside in the local television station’s market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we serve additionally federal law generally provides satellite systems with access to cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite dbs providers also have arrangements with local phone companies in which the dbs provider’s video services are sold together with a local phone company’s highspeed internet and phone services 

  

   

local phone companies 

local phone companies in particular att and verizon have built and continue to build fiberopticbased networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas these local phone companies have continued to offer video services in an increasing number of our service areas and we anticipate that local phone companies’ video services will be offered in a substantial portion of our service areas in the near future in certain areas video services are being offered in addition to joint marketing arrangements local phone companies have entered into with dbs providers local phone companies have taken various positions on the question of whether they need a local cable television franchise to provide video services some like verizon have applied for local cable franchises while others like att claim that they can provide their video services without a local cable franchise notwithstanding their positions both att and verizon have filed for video service franchise certificates under state franchising laws see “legislation and regulation” below 

other providers 

we operate our cable systems under nonexclusive franchises that are issued by a local community governing body such as a city council or county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to local phone companies various other companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services these and other cable systems offer cable services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems 

our cable systems also compete for customers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer customers both improved reception of local television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and commercial developments 

local broadcast services 

local broadcast stations have the ability to broadcast multiple streams of free programming in their digital broadcast spectrum and some broadcasters are providing such services in markets that we serve the increasing use of such free multicast services could present competitive challenges to our cable service 

  

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of other companies many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

 digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to customers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems local phone companies and other companies offer dsl service and several of them have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some local phone companies such as att and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higher speed services in many of our markets the fcc has reduced the obligations of local phone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless phone companies are offering wireless highspeed internet services in addition in a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports wifi internet service is available numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and wimax internet access networks and commercial wimax offerings are being rolled out 

the fcc has adopted an order that prohibits us from engaging in certain highspeed internet network management practices and congress and the fcc are considering creating certain rights for internet content providers and for users of highspeed internet services by imposing “net neutrality” requirements on service providers these requirements as well as any other measures adopted by congress or the fcc that impose additional obligations on highspeed internet service providers could adversely affect our highspeed internet business see “legislation and regulation” below 

  

   

phone services 

our digital phone service competes against local phone companies wireless phone service providers competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other voip service providers the local phone companies have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

  

advertising 

we compete for the sale of advertising against a wide variety of media including local broadcast stations national broadcast networks national and regional programming networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and internet sites 

 

programming segment 

 

the table below presents a summary of our most significant consolidated national programming networks as of december 31 2008 

 

  

revenue for our programming networks is primarily generated from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our programming networks to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both our programming networks assist distributors with ongoing marketing and promotional activities to retain existing customers and acquire new customers although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our programming networks by larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of such distributors could have a material adverse effect on our programming networks 

sources of supply 

our programming networks often produce their own television programs and broadcasts of live events this often requires us to acquire the rights to the content that is used in such productions such as rights to screenplays or sporting events in other cases our programming networks license the cable telecast rights to television programs produced by third parties 

competition 

our programming networks compete with other television programming services for distribution and programming in addition our programming networks compete for audience share with 

all other forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast networks local broadcast stations pay and other cable networks home video payperview and video on demand services and internet sites finally our programming networks compete for advertising revenue with other national and local media including other television networks television stations radio stations newspapers internet sites and direct mail 

other businesses 

 

our other business interests include comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor comcast interactive media develops and operates comcast’s internet businesses focused on entertainment information and communication including comcastnet fancast theplatform fandango plaxo and dailycandy comcast spectacor owns two professional sports teams and two large multipurpose arenas and manages other facilities for sporting events concerts and other events 

we also own noncontrolling interests in certain networks and content providers including mgm in demand tv one pbs kids sprout fearnet new england cable news pittsburgh cable news channel music choice and sportsnet new york in addition we have noncontrolling interests in wirelessrelated companies including clearwire and spectrumco llc 

  

   

legislation and regulation 

our cable segment is subject to regulation by federal state and local governmental authorities under federal and state laws and regulations as well as agreements we enter into with franchising authorities the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” or “act” and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable segment including cable system ownership video customer rates carriage of broadcast television stations the way we sell our programming packages to customers access to cable system channels by franchising authorities and other parties the use of utility poles and conduits and the offering of our highspeed internet and phone services our programming segment is subject to more limited governmental regulation 

federal regulation and regulatory scrutiny of our cable and programming segments have increased over the last three years even as the cable industry is subject to increasing competition from dbs providers phone companies and others for video highspeed internet and phone services meanwhile the fcc has provided regulatory relief and various regulatory advantages to our competitors examples of which are provided below further in some areas the communications act treats certain multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” differently from others for example ownership limits pricing and packaging regulation mustcarry and franchising are not applicable to our dbs competitors regulation continues to present significant adverse risks to our businesses 

regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing rules or prescribe new ones the transition to a new administration under president obama will likely lead to turnover in the leadership of many federal agencies including the fcc we are unable to predict how new leadership in these agencies will ultimately affect regulation of our businesses in addition we always face the risk that congress or one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our businesses such as proposed federal legislation referred to as the employee free choice act which would substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization 

the following paragraphs describe existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements for our businesses 

video services 

 

ownership limits 

the fcc adopted an order in 2007 establishing a 30 limit on the percentage of multichannel video customers that any single cable 

provider can serve nationwide because we currently serve approximately 26 of multichannel video customers nationwide the 30 ownership limit constrains our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities a federal appellate court struck down a similar 30 limit in a 2001 decision and we have appealed the new limit in court the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate a limit on the number of affiliated programming networks a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels was also struck down by the federal appellate court in the 2001 decision the percentage of affiliated programming networks we currently carry is well below the previous 40 limit it is uncertain when the fcc will rule on this issue or how any regulation it adopts might affect us 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations and policies limit the prices that cable operators may charge for limited basic service equipment and installation as well as the manner in which cable operators may package premium or payperview services with other tiers of service these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition the fcc has made this determination for systems covering 33 of our customers and as of december 31 2008 we have pending before the fcc additional petitions for determination of effective competition for systems covering another 12 of our customers an additional 35 of our customers are not subject to rate regulation because numerous local franchising authorities have chosen not to make the fcc certification filing necessary to regulate rates from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming networks on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings as discussed under “ legal proceedings ” in item 3 we and others are currently involved in litigation that could force us and other mvpds to offer programming networks on an a la carte basis additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing customers or regain those we have lost in october 2008 the fcc initiated several inquiries regarding the cable industry’s transition from analog to digital transmission and the potential impact of these transition efforts on pricing and packaging for customers who lack the equipment necessary to receive digital programming we believe that our product and service offerings will improve as we deliver more of our programming through digital transmission because we will be able to provide more highdefinition programming and video on demand services better picture quality of our video services faster internet speeds and other services there is a risk that the fcc could pursue regulatory or enforcement actions in this area which could complicate or delay our transition to digital technology and could have an adverse effect on our business

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for retransmission consent which may enable popular stations to demand cash payments or other significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks affiliated with the broadcaster as a condition of transmitting the tv broadcast signals that video customers expect to receive as part of the transition from analog to digital broadcast transmission congress and the fcc gave each local broadcast station a digital channel capable of carrying multiple programming streams in addition to its current analog channel after the broadcasters’ transition to digital the current transition date is june 12 2009 although broadcasters have the option of making the transition earlier cable operators will have to carry the primary digital programming stream of local broadcast stations as well as an analog version of the primary digital programming stream these requirements will last for at least three years from the date of the digital transition the fcc has provided a limited exemption from these requirements for cable systems with an activated channel capacity of 552 mhz or less under this exemption which applies to certain of our cable systems the operator is only obligated to carry the analog version of the broadcaster’s primary digital programming stream the fcc is also considering proposals to require cable operators to carry after the 2009 transition date some or all of the multiple programming streams transmitted in the broadcaster’s digital signal such expanded mustcarry obligations would further constrain our ability to allocate bandwidth to more highdefinition channels faster internet speeds and other services in addition the fcc is considering proposals that would require cable operators to carry certain low power broadcast television stations that under current regulations generally lack mustcarry rights 

program accessprogram carriagelicense agreements 

the communications act and the fcc’s program access rules generally prevent video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds such as dbs providers and limit the ability of such affiliated programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2012 we have challenged this fcc action in federal court in addition the communications act and the fcc’s program carriage rules prohibit cable operators and other mvpds from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is considering proposals to expand its program access and program carriage regulations that if adopted could have an adverse effect on our businesses in addition under the fcc’s july 2006 order approving our acquis 

ition of adelphia cable systems and related time warner transactions until july 2012 our regional sports networks are generally covered by the program access rules and mvpds may invoke commercial arbitration against such regional sports networks as an alternative to filing a program access complaint with the fcc in addition we are a party to program carriage disputes at the fcc involving three programming networks nfl network wealthtv and midatlantic sports network adverse decisions in these disputes could increase our costs and curtail our flexibility to deliver services to our customers 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator to date we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access however the fcc adopted rules in 2007 that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although the lower rates initially will not apply to home shopping or infomercial programmers the fcc has issued a further notice to determine if such programming should also have the benefit of the lower rates these new fcc rules which have been stayed by a federal court pending the outcome of a challenge brought by us and other cable operators and which also have been blocked by the office of management and budget could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such rules 

cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services effective july 2007 cable operators were prohibited from acquiring for deployment settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions settop boxes purchased after that date must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard which adds to the cost of settop boxes in addition the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets that can connect directly to a cable network and receive oneway analog and digital video services without the need for a settop box the fcc is also considering proposals to establish regulations for plugandplay retail devices that can access twoway cable services some of the proposals if adopted would impose substantial costs on us and impair our ability to innovate in april 2008 we joined major consumer electronics companies information technology companies and other major cable operators in an agreement to use certain technology to enable retail devices to access twoway cable services we believe that this interindustry agreement makes it less likely the fcc will adopt twoway plugandplay requirements in the near future 

  

   

mdus and inside wiring 

in october 2007 the fcc adopted an order prohibiting the enforcement of exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus and other private real estate developments the order also prohibits the execution of new exclusive access agreements the order has been appealed by the national cable  telecommunications association “ncta” the cable industry’s trade organization the fcc is also considering proposals to extend these prohibitions to noncable mvpds and to expand the scope of the rules to prohibit exclusive marketing and bulk billing agreements because we have a significant number of exclusive access agreements the fcc’s order to abrogate the exclusivity provisions of those agreements could negatively affect our business as would adoption of new limits on exclusive marketing and bulk billing the fcc has also adopted rules facilitating competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such mdus these rules could also have an adverse impact on our business as they allow our competitors to use wiring we have deployed to reach potential customers more quickly and inexpensively 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rate that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole rate standards the fcc or a state could increase pole attachment rates paid by cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we could face materially higher pole attachment costs in november 2007 the fcc initiated a proceeding to consider whether to modify its rules governing prices for pole attachments among other issues the fcc is considering establishing a new unified pole attachment rate that would apply to cable system attachments where the cable operator provides highspeed internet services and perhaps phone services as well the proposed rate would be higher than the current rate paid by cable service providers but lower than the rate that applies to attachments used to provide telecommunications services if adopted this proposal could materially increase our costs by increasing our existing payments for pole attachments 

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and 

meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and many of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

there has been considerable activity at both the federal and state levels addressing franchise requirements imposed on new entrants this activity is primarily directed at facilitating local phone companies’ entry into cable services in december 2006 the fcc adopted new rules designed to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants by among other things limiting the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants requiring franchising authorities to act on franchise applications by new entrants within 90 days and preempting certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements the fcc subsequently adopted more modest franchising relief for existing cable operators we could be materially disadvantaged if the rules continue to set a different less burdensome standard for some of our competitors than for ourselves from time to time congress has also considered proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for local phone companies and other new entrants we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what effect it would have on our business 

in addition approximately half of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants thus relieving new entrants of many of the local franchising burdens faced by incumbent operators some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the applicant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the applicant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these state statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent’s franchise area however even in those states where incumbent cable operators are allowed to opt into a state franchise we often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or 

  

   

elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review in june 2008 the copyright office issued a report to congress in which it recommended eliminating the compulsory copyright license in favor of free market negotiations between cable operators and copyright owners if adopted this proposal could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs in may 2008 the copyright office rejected a cable industry request to clarify that copyright fees associated with the retransmission of outofmarket broadcast signals should be limited to system customers who actually receive those signals the copyright office concluded it did not have authority under the governing statute to adopt that interpretation there is a risk that the copyright office’s determination on this issue could materially increase the copyright royalty fees that we and other cable operators pay to retransmit outofmarket broadcast signals further in june 2008 the copyright office issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in this notice the copyright office proposed to require royalty fees from cable operators for carriage of each digital multicast stream of programming from an outofmarket television broadcast station if adopted this proposal could significantly increase our royalty fees for the carriage of outofmarket television stations in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create including our cable segment’s local advertising and local origination programming and our programming segment’s original programs these licensing fees have been the source of litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 

highspeed internet services 

 

we provide highspeed internet services by means of our existing cable systems in 2002 the fcc ruled that this was an interstate information service that is not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

several parties are advocating that congress and the fcc adopt socalled “net neutrality” rules that would define certain rights for users of highspeed internet services and regulate or restrict some types of commercial agreements between service providers and providers of internet content in 2005 the fcc issued what was characterized at the time as a nonbinding policy statement identifying four principles that will guide its policymaking regarding high 

speed internet and related services these principles provide that consumers are entitled to i access lawful internet content of their choice ii run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement iii connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and iv enjoy competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers some have proposed that congress and the fcc adopt these principles as formal rules and also impose nondiscrimination and disclosure requirements on highspeed internet service providers congress has rejected similar proposals in the past but such proposals may be revisited and possibly broadened any such rules or statutes could limit our ability to manage our cable systems including use for other services obtain value for use of our cable systems or respond to competitive conditions we cannot predict whether “net neutrality” rules or statutes will be adopted 

all networks must be managed to provide highquality consistent and safe highspeed internet services in august 2008 the fcc found that we had violated “federal internet policies” by engaging in certain network management practices intended to address congestion on our highspeed internet network as a result we were ordered to disclose certain information about our network management practices to the fcc and to cease the practices at issue by december 31 2008 we are challenging that decision in federal court in the interim we complied with the disclosure requirements imposed by the fcc in addition as of december 31 2008 we stopped using our earlier techniques in favor of a new set of protocolagnostic network management congestion practices and we have so informed the fcc continued fcc regulation of our highspeed internet network management practices could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to manage our network efficiently 

a federal program known as the universal service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on their revenue from telecommunications services in recent years roughly 10 of revenue into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers congress is considering proposals that could result in highspeed internet services being subject to universal service fees we cannot predict whether or how the universal service funding system might be extended to cover highspeed internet services or if that occurs how it will affect us 

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments have also adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain state and local governments are also considering proposals to impose customer 

  

   

service quality of service taxation child safety privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

phone services 

 

we currently offer phone services using interconnected voip technology upon receipt of requested approvals for two remaining service areas we will no longer provide circuitswitched phone service the fcc has adopted a number of orders addressing regulatory issues relating to providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours including regulations relating to customer proprietary network information local number portability duties and benefits disability access e911 calea and contributions to the federal universal service fund but has not yet ruled on the appropriate classification of the specific type of voice services that we provide the regulatory environment for interconnected voip services therefore remains uncertain at both the federal and state level until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip services for state and federal regulatory purposes state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on such services 

we and two other cable operators filed a complaint with the fcc against verizon in 2008 claiming that verizon had violated a statutory carrier proprietary information requirement in processing requests from us to transfer verizon customers who had selected us to be their voice provider the fcc subsequently upheld the complaint and a federal appellate court rejected verizon’s appeal of the fcc’s order verizon could seek additional judicial review and if the order were overturned on further appeal our ability to increase our voice services customer base could be adversely affected 

the fcc and congress also are considering how nontraditional voice services should interconnect with local phone companies’ phone networks since the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of these services the precise scope of local phone company interconnection rules applicable to providers of nontraditional voice services is not entirely clear as a result some local phone companies may resist interconnecting directly with these providers in light of these concerns providers of these services typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to local phone company networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right as a telecommunications carrier to request and obtain interconnection with local phone companies is set forth in the communications act we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs and through third party clecs however certain parties have chal 

lenged our interconnection rights at the fcc and various state commissions and these proceedings remain unresolved 

it is uncertain whether and when the fcc or congress will adopt further rules regarding interconnection rights and arrangements and how such rules would affect our voice services 

other areas 

 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable segment and limited aspects of our programming segment including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards political advertising indecent or obscene programming emergency alert system requirements for analog and digital services closed captioning requirements for the hearing impaired commercial restrictions on children’s programming origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator sponsorship identification equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing technical standards relating to operation of the cable network and regulatory fees we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and programming businesses in addition while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with fcc rules we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the fcc which can result in our having to pay fines to the agency 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes or fees are computed these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video and voice services we and other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes through administrative and court proceedings in addition in some situations our dbs competitors do not face similar state tax and fee burdens congress has also considered and may consider again proposals to bar states from imposing taxes on dbs providers that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay 

privacy and security regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information by cable operators there are exceptions that permit the collection and disclosure of this information for rendering service conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests the telecommunications act of 1996 provides additional privacy protections for customer proprietary network information commonly known as cpni related to our digital phone services 

  

   

a handful of states and the district of columbia have enacted privacy laws that apply to cable services 

we are also subject to state and federal rules and laws regarding information security most of these rules and laws apply to customer information that could be used to commit identity theft fortyfive states and the district of columbia have enacted security breach notification laws these laws generally require that a business give notice to its customers whose financial account information has been disclosed because of a security breach the federal trade commission “ftc” is applying the “red flag rules” in the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 to both financial institutions and creditors because we permit customers to pay us for services usually 30 days after they receive them we are considered a creditor according to the ftc’s interpretation of the rules we intend to comply with these rules which become effective for us on may 1 2009 by using an identity theft prevention program to identify detect and respond to patterns practices or specific activities that could indicate identity theft 

we are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails additional and more restrictive requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy or security standards or if congress enacts new privacy or security legislation 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 100000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 89000 were associated with our cable business and the remainder were associated with our programming and other businesses approximately 6000 of our employees including parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

caution concerning forwardlooking 

statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” 

“potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that those statements are only our predictions in evaluating those statements you should specifically consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “ risk factors ” under item 1a and in other reports we file with the sec actual events or our actual results may differ materially from any of our forwardlooking statements 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations because of changes in such factors other factors and risks could adversely affect our operations business or financial results of our businesses in the future and could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

all of the services offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers we compete directly with other programming distributors including dbs companies phone companies companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve and companies that offer programming and other communications services to our customers and potential customers including highspeed internet and voice service providers our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 

we may face increased competition because of technological advances and new regulatory requirements which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

in addition to marketing dbs services in certain areas local phone companies have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberopticbased networks and in some cases are using ip technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas local phone companies and various other companies also offer dsl and other internet services we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future if we choose technology that is not as 

  

   

effective costefficient or attractive to customers as that employed by our competitors our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

further new technologies and services have been developed such as video streaming over the internet and may continue to be developed that compete with services that our cable systems offer and such services may not be regulated in the same manner or to the same extent as our services the success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors 

programming expenses are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future the mvpd industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming in addition as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers we face increased programming expenses if we are unable to raise our customers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands including demands for cash payments and other concessions by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our customers we cannot predict the magnitude of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we concede to certain of these demands or fail to obtain the required consents 

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose additional costs and restrictions 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet service and digital phone service industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases adversely affect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations 

in addition local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these 

franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition of renewal or transfer and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in addition we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if local phone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us for example the fcc has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 and refer to the “ franchising ” discussion within that section 

we also face other risks related to federal state and local regulations for example congress and the fcc are also considering various forms of “net neutrality” regulation see “legislation and regulation” in item 1 and refer to the “ highspeed internet services ” discussion within that section for a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with our regulation by federal state and local governments see “ legislation and regulation ” in item 1 

weakening economic conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

during 2008 the global financial markets were in turmoil and the equity and credit markets experienced extreme volatility which caused already weak economic conditions to worsen a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions to the extent these conditions continue customers may reduce the advanced or premium services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable services this risk may be worsened by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services such as video streaming over the internet or substitute services such as wireless phones the weakening economy affected our net customer additions during 2008 and also had a negative impact on the advertising revenue of our cable segment if these economic conditions continue to deteriorate the growth of our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

further because of the turmoil in the global financial markets some financial and other institutions have experienced and continue to experience significant financial distress although we have attempted to be prudent in our investment strategy it is not possible to predict how the financial market turmoil and the deteriorating economic conditions may affect our financial position additional financial institution failures could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities could cause losses to the extent cash amounts or the value of securities exceed government deposit insurance limits and could restrict our access to the public equity and debt markets 

  

   

we rely on network and information systems and other technology and a disruption or failure of such networks systems or technology may disrupt our business 

network and information systems and other technologies are critical to our business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing or power outages natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events could result in a degradation or disruption of our cable services excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment and data these network and information systemsrelated events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future further any security breaches such as misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach the occurrence of any such network or information systemrelated events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support 

we depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services moreover some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products while we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or if demand exceeds their capacity or they cannot otherwise meet our specifications our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected in which case our business results of operation and financial position may be adversely affected 

our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 

we rely on our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties to use our technologies conduct our operations and sell our products and services legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur substantial monetary 

liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even if we believe any such claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our business moreover because of the rapid pace of technological change we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those described under the caption “ legal proceedings ” in item 3 and those arising in the ordinary course of business including regulatory and administrative proceedings claims and audits while we do not expect the final disposition of any of these litigation matters will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period and any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings could be time consuming costly and injure our reputation further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our financial position 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common

 item 2 properties 

we believe that substantially all of our physical assets are in good operating condition 

cable 

 

our principal physical assets consist of operating plant and equipment including signal receiving encoding and decoding devices headends and distribution systems and equipment at or near our customers’ homes the signal receiving apparatus typically includes a tower antenna ancillary electronic equipment and earth stations for reception of satellite signals headends consist of electronic equipment necessary for the reception amplification and 

modulation of signals and are located near the receiving devices our distribution system consists primarily of coaxial and fiberoptic cables lasers routers switches and related electronic equipment our cable plants and related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities although in some areas the distribution cable is buried in underground ducts or trenches customer premises equipment “cpe” consists primarily of settop boxes and cable modems the physical components of cable systems require periodic maintenance and replacement

patent litigation 

 

we are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses in certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants and also in certain of these cases we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions 

   

  

   

we believe the claims in each of the actions described above in this item are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously although we cannot predict the outcome of any of the actions described above or how the final resolution of any such actions would impact our results of operations or cash flows for any one period or our consolidated financial condition the final disposition of any of the above actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period 

other 

 

we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business while the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time consuming costly and injure our reputation

 item 7 management’s discussion and 

analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

 

we are the nation’s leading provider of cable services offering a variety of entertainment information and communications services to residential and commercial customers as of december 31 2008 our cable systems served approximately 242 million video customers 149 million highspeed internet customers and 65 million phone customers and passed over 506 million homes in 39 states and the district of columbia we report the results of these operations as our cable segment which generates approximately 95 of our consolidated revenue our cable segment also includes the operations of our regional sports networks our other reportable segment programming consists primarily of our national programming networks during 2008 our operations generated consolidated revenue of approximately 343 billion 

our cable segment generates revenue primarily through subscriptions to our video highspeed internet and phone services “cable services” we market our cable services individually and in packages to residential customers and to small and mediumsized businesses our video services range from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels on demand music channels and an interactive onscreen program guide digital video customers may also subscribe to advanced digital video services including digital video recorder “dvr” and highdefinition television “hdtv” as of december 31 2008 approximately 48 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video service and approximately 70 of those video customers subscribed to at least one of our digital video services our highspeed internet services provide internet access at downstream speeds of up to 24 mbps depending on the service selected and up to 50 mbps with the introduction of docsis 30 technology also referred to as wideband based on geographic market availability as of december 31 2008 approximately 30 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet services our digital phone services provide local and longdistance calling and other features as of december 31 2008 approximately 14 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our digital phone services in addition to cable services other cable segment revenue sources include advertising and the operation of our regional sports networks 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks including e golf channel versus g4 and style revenue from our programming segment is generated primarily from the sale of advertising from monthly 

per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers and from licensing our programming internationally 

our other business interests include comcast interactive media and comcast spectacor comcast interactive media develops and operates comcast’s internet businesses including comcastnet fancast theplatform fandango plaxo and dailycandy revenue from comcast interactive media is generated primarily from the sale of advertising comcast spectacor owns two professional sports teams and two large multipurpose arenas in philadelphia and manages other facilities for sporting events concerts and other events comcast interactive media comcast spectacor and all other consolidated businesses not included in our cable or programming segments are included in “corporate and other” activities 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and phone companies in 2008 our competitors continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer and the local phone companies have continued to expand their service areas a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net customer additions in 2008 and may if these conditions continue adversely impact our results of operations in the future 

2008 developments 

  

  

  

  



  

   

  

  



  

  

  



 

 

the areas we serve 

the map below highlights our 40 major markets with emphasis on our operations in the top 25 us tv markets 

  

   

consolidated operating results 

 

the comparability of our results of operations and customer data is impacted by the effects of cable system acquisitions we made in 2008 2007 and 2006 resulting from the insight transaction the houston transaction the acquisition of patriot media the adelphia and time warner transactions and the acquisition of susquehanna communications which we collectively refer to as the “newly acquired cable systems”  see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements as a result of transferring our previously owned cable systems located in los angeles cleveland and dallas the “comcast exchange systems” as part of the adelphia and time warner transactions in july 2006 the operating results of the comcast exchange systems are reported as discontinued operations for 2006 

 

 all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

consolidated revenue 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated revenue for 2008 and 2007 additional increases of approximately 129 million and approximately 103 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively related to our other business activities primarily growth in comcast interactive media and revenue generated in 2008 by comcast spectacor’s professional sports teams cable segment revenue and programming segment revenue are discussed separately in “segment operating results” 

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 additional increases of approximately 103 million and approximately 210 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively related to our other business activities including the continued expansion of our comcast interactive media business comcast spectacor and litigation expense incurred in 2007 cable segment and programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses are discussed separately in “segment operating results” 

  

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

the increases in depreciation expense for 2008 and 2007 were primarily a result of an increase in property and equipment associated with capital spending in recent years which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately 210 million and 700 million respectively and the newly acquired cable systems which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately 138 million and 530 million respectively 

the decrease in amortization expense for 2008 was primarily due to intangible assets associated with the att broadband acquisition in 2002 being fully amortized partially offset by the amortization of similar intangible assets recorded in connection with our newly acquired cable systems the increase in amortization expense for 2007 was primarily a result of the increases in the amortization of our intangible assets associated with our newly acquired cable systems purchases of softwarerelated intangibles and the writedown of intangible assets of approximately 30 million in 2007 related to the shutdown of the azn network 

  

   

segment operating results 

 

our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information to measure the performance of our operating segments we use operating income loss before depreciation and amortization excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations additionally it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements  see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

cable segment overview 

 

our cable systems simultaneously deliver video highspeed internet and phone services to our customers the majority of our 

cable segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to these cable services customers are billed monthly based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use while residential customers may discontinue service at any time business customers may only discontinue their service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts which typically have one to three year terms our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of the effects of our recent acquisitions continued demand for our services including our bundled and advanced service offerings as well as other factors discussed below 

of our total customers in 2008 the newly acquired cable systems accounted for 696000 video customers 370000 highspeed internet customers and 74000 phone customers in 2007 they accounted for 81000 video customers 58000 highspeed internet customers and 16000 phone customers in 2006 they accounted for 35 million video customers 17 million highspeed internet customers and 173000 phone customers in 2008 and 2007 the newly acquired cable systems accounted for approximately 742 million and 26 billion of the increases in revenue respectively intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net customer additions in 2008 and may if these conditions continue adversely impact our results of operations in the future 

 

cable segment results of operations 

 

   

   

cable segment revenue 

our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to approximately 110 in 2008 from approximately 102 in 2007 and approximately 95 in 2006 the increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer are primarily due to an increased number of customers receiving multiple services 

 

video 

we offer video services ranging from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels including premium and payperview channels digital video customers may also subscribe to advanced digital video services including dvr and hdtv as of december 31 2008 70 of our video customers subscribed to at least one of our digital video services compared to 63 and 52 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our video revenue continued to grow in 2008 and 2007 due to customer growth in our digital video services including the demand for digital features such as on demand dvr and hdtv rate adjustments and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems during 2008 and 2007 we added approximately 15 million and 25 million digital video customers respectively during 2008 and 2007 the number of video customers decreased by approximately 575000 and 180000 respectively excluding the impact of the newly acquired cable systems primarily due to increased competition in our service areas as well as weakness in the overall economy continued competition and weak economic conditions are expected to result in further declines in the number of video customers during 2009 in 2008 approximately 455 million of the increase in our video revenue was attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2007 the amount was approximately 16 billion our average monthly video revenue per video customer increased to approximately 64 in 2008 from approximately 61 in 2007 and approximately 57 in 2006 

highspeed internet 

we offer highspeed internet services with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 24 mbps depending on the service 

selected and up to 50 mbps with the introduction of docsis 30 technology also referred to as wideband based on geographic market availability these services also include our internet portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of proprietary content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed our services provide 

revenue increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to an increase in the number of customers and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems as of december 31 2008 30 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet service compared to 28 and 25 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 approximately 157 million of the increase in revenue was attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2007 the amount was approximately 640 million average monthly revenue per highspeed internet customer has remained relatively stable between 42 and 43 from 2006 to 2008 we expect the rates of customer and revenue growth to slow in 2009 due to the market maturing increased competition and weak economic conditions continuing 

phone 

we offer digital phone services that provide local and longdistance calling and include features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting as of december 31 2008 our digital phone services were available to approximately 47 million or 92 of the homes in the areas we serve 

revenue increased significantly in 2008 and 2007 as a result of increases in the number of digital phone customers these increases were partially offset by the loss of approximately 170000 and 470000 circuitswitched phone customers in 2008 and 2007 respectively we phased out substantially all of our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 in 2008 approximately 43 million of the increase in our phone revenue was attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2007 the amount was approximately 100 million average monthly revenue per 

  

   

customer for our digital phone service has declined to approximately 39 in 2008 from approximately 42 in 2007 and approximately 45 in 2006 due to customers receiving service as part of a promotional offer or in a bundled service offering we expect the rates of customer and revenue growth to slow in 2009 because we do not expect to launch any significant new service areas in 2009 and due to weak economic conditions continuing 

 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects these interconnects establish a physical direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator 

advertising revenue decreased in 2008 primarily due to a decline in the television advertising market including the automotive and housing sectors offset by an increase in political advertising and the addition of the newly acquired cable systems advertising revenue increased in 2007 as a result of our newly acquired cable systems absent the growth from the newly acquired cable systems advertising revenue decreased slightly in 2007 reflecting weakness across the television advertising market a lower level of political advertising and one less week in the broadcast calendar during 2007 compared to 2006 we expect our advertising revenue to decline in 2009 due to a deteriorating advertising market less political advertising and weak economic conditions continuing 

  

other 

we also generate revenue from our regional sports networks our digital media center onscreen guide advertising commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees for other services our regional sports networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimore washington cable sports southeast comcast sportsnet chicago comcast sportsnet california sacramento comcast sportsnet northwest portland comcast sportsnet new england boston comcast sportsnet bay area san francisco and mountainwest sports network these networks generate revenue through programming license agreements with multichannel video providers and the sale of advertising time 

other revenue increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of our acquisitions in june 2007 of comcast sportsnet bay area and comcast sportsnet new england and our acquisitions of the newly acquired cable systems 

franchise fees 

our franchise fee revenue represents the passthrough to our customers of the fees required to be paid to state and local franchising authorities under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue the increases in franchise fees collected from our cable customers in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to increases in the revenue on which the fees apply 

cable segment expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margins operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 were 406  407 and 402 respectively 

  

  

   

cable segment operating expenses 

 

  

video programming expenses our largest operating expense are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we package offer and distribute to our video customers these expenses are affected by changes in the fees charged by programming networks the number of our video customers and the number of programming options we offer video programming expenses increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to rate increases additional digital customers an additional number of programming options and additional customers from our newly acquired cable systems we anticipate that our video programming expenses will continue to increase in 2009 and in the future as the fees charged by programming networks increase as new fees for retransmission of broadcast networks are incurred and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our customers 

technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor to complete service call and installation activities in the home network operations fulfillment and provisioning costs these expenses increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to growth in the number of customers which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide inhouse customer support and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems 

  

highspeed internet expenses and phone expenses include certain direct costs identified by us for providing these services other related costs associated with providing these services are generally shared among all our cable services and are not allocated to these captions the decrease in highspeed internet expenses in 2008 was primarily driven by lower support service costs that were the result of our entering into new contracts with lower cost providers and renegotiating existing contracts highspeed internet expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to growth in the number of customers receiving these services and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems phone expenses grew at a lower rate in 2008 due to efficiencies associated with an increased number of customers as well as the leastcost routing of call traffic and lower support service costs that were the result of our entering into new contracts with lower cost providers and renegotiating existing contracts phone expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to growth in the number of customers receiving these services and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems 

other operating expenses include franchise fees pole rentals plant maintenance and vehiclerelated costs including fuel as well as expenses related to our regional sports networks these expenses increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the addition of our newly acquired cable systems and the acquisitions in june 2007 of comcast sportsnet bay area and comcast sportsnet new england 

 

cable segment selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 customer service expenses remained relatively flat in 2008 primarily due to achieving operational efficiencies and the slower growth in customers customer service expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to growth in the number of customers and services offered 

marketing expenses increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining customers as well as the addition of the newly acquired cable systems 

administrative and other expenses increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the addition of our newly acquired cable systems and the acquisitions in june 2007 of comcast sportsnet bay area and comcast sportsnet new england administrative and other expenses in 2008 also include severance costs of approximately 126 million primarily related to approximately 3300 personnel reductions a portion of which resulted from a divisional reorganization 

  

   

programming segment overview 

 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks the table below presents a summary of our most significant consolidated national programming networks

programming segment results of operations 

 

  

 

programming segment revenue 

programming revenue for 2008 and 2007 increased as a result of continued growth in advertising revenue programming license fee revenue and international revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 advertising accounted for approximately 43 44 and 45 respectively of total programming revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 11 to 13 of our programming revenue was generated from our cable segment these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses 

programming operating selling general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events the purchase of programming rights the marketing and promotion of our programming networks and administrative costs programming expenses increased significantly in 2007 primarily due to the programming rights costs for the pga tour on golf channel as well as a corresponding increase in marketing expenses for this programming we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new and liveevent programming that will cause our programming expenses to increase in the future 

  

consolidated other income expense items 

 

 

 interest expense 

the increase in interest expense for 2008 was primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding and an increase in early extinguishment costs of approximately 61 million associated with the repayment and redemption of certain debt obligations prior to their maturity partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates in 2008 on our fixed to variable rate interest rate exchange agreements the increase for 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding 

investment income loss net 

the components of investment income loss net for 2008 2007 and 2006 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of all of 

  

   

our investments accounted for as trading securities the differences between the unrealized gains losses on trading securities and the mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities as presented in the table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 other income expense 

other expense for 2008 includes an impairment of approximately 600 million related to our investment in clearwire see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements partially offset by a gain of approximately 235 million on the sale of our 50 interest in the insight asset pool in connection with the insight transaction other income for 2007 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately 500 million on the sale of our 50 interest in the kansas city asset pool in connection with the houston transaction other income for 2006 consisted primarily of 170 million of gains on the sale of nonoperating assets partially offset by a 59 million impairment related to one of our equity method investments 

income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2008 2007 and 2006 was 378 414 and 375 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions our 2008 income tax expense was reduced by approximately 154 million 80 million of which is due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position  see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and the net impact of certain state tax law changes that primarily affected our deferred income tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and the balance of which is primarily due to the future deductibility of certain deferred compensation arrangements our tax rate in 2006 was impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions which were primarily due to the favorable resolution of issues and revised estimates of 

the outcome of unresolved issues with various taxing authorities we expect our 2009 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 40 to 45 

discontinued operations 

 

the operating results of our previously owned cable systems located in los angeles dallas and cleveland which were reported as discontinued operations for 2006 included 7 months of operations in 2006 because the closing date of the transaction was july 31 2006 as a result of the exchange of these systems in the adelphia and time warner transactions we recognized a gain of 195 million net of tax of 541 million in 2006  see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements the effective tax rate on the gain is higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the nondeductible amounts attributed to goodwill 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities through existing cash cash equivalents and investments through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and through our ability to obtain future external financing 

we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to fund our capital expenditures to invest in business opportunities to meet our debt repayment obligations and to return capital to investors 

the global financial markets have been and continue to be in turmoil with extreme volatility in the equity and credit markets and with some financial and other institutions experiencing significant financial distress as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 55 billion remaining availability under our credit facilities and no outstanding commercial paper obligations from 2009 to 2011 our scheduled debt maturities total approximately 53 billion in addition neither our access to nor the value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments have been negatively affected by the recent liquidity problems of financial institutions although we have attempted to be prudent in our investment strategy it is not possible to predict how the financial market turmoil and the deteriorating economic conditions may affect our financial position additional financial institution failures could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities could cause losses to the extent cash amounts or the value of securities exceed government deposit insurance limits and could restrict our access to the public equity and debt markets 

  

   

operating activities 

components of net cash provided by operating activities 

 

  

the increases in interest payments in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding 

the decrease in tax payments in 2008 was primarily due to the economic stimulus act of 2008 which resulted in a reduction in our tax payments of approximately 600 million the increase in tax payments in 2007 was primarily due to the effects of increases in income sales of investments and the settlement of federal and state tax audits of 376 million 

  

financing activities 

net cash provided by used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings offset by our debt repayments our repurchases of our class a and class a special common stock and dividend payments proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions in 2008 we made 307 million of optional public bond repurchases see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings 

available borrowings under credit facilities 

we traditionally maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements in january 2008 we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility that may be used for general corporate purposes this amendment increased the size of the credit facility from 50 billion to 70 billion and extended the maturity of the loan commitment from october 2010 to january 2013 under our credit facility other lenders are not obligated to fund a defaulting lender’s commitment although another lender could agree to fund the defaulting lender’s commitment however nondefaulting lenders are not able to use a default by another bank to avoid their own commitments in december 2008 we terminated a 200 million commitment to our credit facility by lehman brothers bank fsb “lehman” as a result of lehman’s default under a borrowing request at a discounted value we repaid lehman’s portion of our outstanding credit facility along with accrued interest and fees subsequent to this termination the size of our credit facility is 68 billion as of december 31 2008 amounts available under all of our credit facilities totaled approximately 55 billion 

debt covenants 

we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities  see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital our credit facilities’ covenants are tested on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in our 68 billion revolving credit 

  

   

facility due 2013 relates to leverage ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2008 we met this financial covenant by a significant margin our ability to comply with this financial covenant in the future does not depend on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 

share repurchase and dividends 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 41 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization we have previously indicated our plan to fully use our remaining share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009 subject to market conditions however as previously disclosed due to difficult economic conditions and instability in the capital markets it is unlikely that we will complete our share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009 as previously planned 

 

our board of directors declared a dividend of 00625 per share for each quarter in 2008 totaling approximately 727 million we paid approximately 547 million of dividends in 2008 we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends though each subsequent dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors we did not declare or pay any cash dividends in 2007 or 2006 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures acquisitions and investments partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments 

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable segment and we expect that this will continue in the future a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment from 2006 through 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  



  

   

cable capital expenditures decreased 75 in 2008 primarily due to lower spending in residential cable services line extensions decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the slowdown in the housing market cable capital expenditures increased 412 in 2007 primarily as a result of the continued rollout of our digital phone service and an increase in demand for advanced settop boxes including dvr and hdtv and highspeed internet modems these increases were accelerated by the success of our triple play bundle and as a result of regulatory changes in 2007 we also incurred additional capital expenditures in our newly acquired cable systems and continued to improve the capacity and reliability of our network in 2007 in order to handle the additional volume and advanced services 

capital expenditures in our programming segment were not significant in 2008 2007 and 2006 in 2008 and 2007 our other business activities included approximately 137 million and 110 million respectively of capital expenditures related to the consolidation of offices in pennsylvania and the relocation of our corporate headquarters capital expenditures for 2009 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services our 2009 capital expenditures will include the purchase of settop boxes associated with our migration to all digital transmission for certain analog channels 

  

acquisitions 

in 2008 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisition of an additional interest in comcast sportsnet bay area our acquisition of the remaining interest in g4 that we did not already own and our acquisitions of plaxo and dailycandy in 2007 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisitions of patriot media fandango comcast sportsnet new england and an interest in comcast sportsnet bay area in 2006 acquisitions were primarily related to the adelphia and time warner transactions the acquisition of the cable systems of susquehanna communications and the acquisition of our additional interest in e entertainment television 

proceeds from sales of investments 

in 2008 proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of availableforsale debt securities in 2007 and 2006 proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of our ownership interests in time warner inc 

purchases of investments 

in 2008 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the funding of our investment in clearwire in 2007 purchases of investments consisted primarily of an additional investment in insight midwest lp and the purchase of availableforsale debt securities in 2006 purchases of investments consisted primarily of the purchase of our interest in spectrumco llc and our additional investment in texas and kansas city cable partners 

 

contractual obligations 

 

our unconditional contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 which consist primarily of our debt obligations and the associated payments due in future periods are presented in the table below 

 refer to note 9 longterm debt and note 15 commitments to our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

  

  

   

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements we had previously disclosed that the accounting judgments and estimates related to our legal contingencies were critical in the preparation of our financial statements this identification was based in large part on the fact that significant amounts were included in our consolidated balance sheet representing management’s estimates of the ultimate outcome of these legal contingencies as substantially all of the contingencies to which these balance sheet estimates have been resolved and there are no significant estimates recorded for current legal contingencies as they are either not probable estimable or both estimates related to our legal contingencies are not critical in the preparation of our financial statements at december 31 2008 management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services such as advanced digital video services and highspeed internet and phone services in a 

particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6400 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed its fair value “impairment testing” in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” 

we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by underlying assets current market transactions and profitability information in analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models 

if we were to determine the value of our cable franchise rights is less than the carrying amount we would recognize an impairment for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for purposes of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our cable divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level  see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

since the adoption of sfas no 142 in 2002 we have not recorded any significant impairments as a result of our impairment testing a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment 

we could also record impairments in the future if there are changes in longterm market conditions in expected future operating results or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights assumptions made about increased competition and a further slowdown in the economy on a longerterm basis could impact the valuations to be used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the july 1 2008 annual impairment testing “july 1 testing” such assumptions and fair values will not be determined until the july 1 2009 annual impairment testing is performed our july 1 testing which included assumptions related to the weakening economy 

  

   

indicated that the estimated fair value of our cable franchise rights exceeded the carrying value “headroom” for each of our units of accounts by a significant amount see table below given the significant headroom that existed on july 1 2008 we do not believe the current economic environment regulatory changes or the decline in our market capitalization since our july 1 testing represent events or changes in circumstances that are indicative of an impairment of value at december 31 2008 the table below illustrates the impairment related to our various cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing 

 

  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

on january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” we evaluate our tax positions using the 

recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with this interpretation from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved 

we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent the effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved either individually or in the aggregate differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative 

disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of december 31 2008 approximately 93 of our total debt of 325 billion was at fixed rates with the remaining debt at variable rates we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 

  

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which can include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 93 to 82 as of december 31 2008 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments decreased increased our interest expense by approximately 34 million 43 million and 39 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future including as a result of proposed changes in accounting for these instruments 

 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2008 

 

 we use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the payments necessary or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate “libor” for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2008 plus the applicable margin in effect on december 31 2008 

as a matter of practice we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of 44 million and a liability of 3 million respectively the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time 

  

   

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sales agreements and indexed debt instruments 

except as described above in “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 6 and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussions of our derivative financial instruments

our cable systems employ a network architecture of hybrid fiber coax that we believe is sufficiently flexible to support our current and future requirements this network allows the twoway delivery of broadband transmissions which is essential to providing advanced video services such as video on demand and dvr and highspeed internet and digital phone services in order to continue to take advantage of growing video offerings as well as future crossplatform features that will integrate all of our services we will need to be more efficient in our use of bandwidth available in our network we believe this can be achieved by delivering our current video services using less bandwidth to that end we are moving certain of our video programming from the analog tier to the digital tier which allows us to deliver the same programming using less bandwidth and we are using advanced encoding to deliver hdtv content in a more bandwidth efficient manner without a loss in picture quality in certain areas we have begun the deployment of a technology called switched digital video which enables us to stream a channel to a subscriber’s home only when they request it all of these measures will free up bandwidth capacity that can be made available for other uses 

in support of our bundled services strategy we are developing features that operate across two or more of our services for example we are developing an online application that integrates key features of our video highspeed internet and digital phone services 

  

   

historically we have relied on thirdparty hardware and software vendors for many of the technologies needed for the operation of our businesses for the addition of new features to existing services and for the development and commercialization of new service offerings in recent years we have begun developing strategically important software and technologies internally and developing technology specifications that integrate thirdparty software we are also expanding the use of open technology solutions that allow multiple vendors to more easily integrate with our technology we have arranged for longterm access rights to national fiberopticbased networks that we actively manage to interconnect our local and regional distribution systems and to facilitate the efficient delivery of our services we expect these efforts to continue and to expand in the future our internal development efforts require greater initial expenditures than would be required if we continued to purchase or license products and services from third parties 

we have purchased wireless spectrum both directly and through a consortium and we are exploring strategies that would use this spectrum to enhance our existing service offerings and to offer new services 

sales and marketing 

we offer our products and services directly to customers through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising television advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets we also market our video highspeed internet and digital phone services individually and as bundled services 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment we compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite “dbs” operators and telephone companies in 2007 many of these competitors expanded their service areas added features and adopted aggressive pricing and packaging for services and features that are comparable to the services and features we offer these competitive factors have impacted and are likely to continue to impact our results of operations in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment where it is likely new technologies will further increase the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and for our advertising business we expect advances in communications technology to continue in the future and we are unable to predict what effects these developments will have on our businesses and operations 

  

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by ilecs in networks capable of distributing video 

  

   

programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings furthermore congress and various state governments are considering measures that would reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including ilecs certain of these franchising entry measures have already been adopted by the fcc and in many states in which we operate we could be significantly disadvantaged if proposals to change franchising rules for our competitors but not for cable operators are approved and implemented see “ legislation and regulation ” below 

direct broadcast satellite systems according to recent government and industry reports conventional mediumpower and highpower satellites provide video programming to over 30 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 300 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and echostar provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

highpower satellite service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outdoor antennas satellite systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals currently delivered to subscribers by dbs providers 

federal legislation establishes among other things a compulsory copyright license that permits satellite systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who reside in the local television station’s market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we serve additionally federal law generally provides satellite systems with access to cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite these dbs providers are also attempting to expand their service offerings to include among other things highspeed internet services they have also entered into marketing arrangements with ilecs in which the dbs providers’ video services are promoted and sold together with an ilec’s highspeed internet and phone services 

incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs in particular att and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas these ilecs have begun to offer video services in an increasing number of our service areas and in certain areas video services are being offered in addition to joint marketing arrangements ilecs have entered into with dbs providers ilecs have taken various positions on the question of whether they need 

a local cable television franchise to provide video services some like verizon have applied for local cable franchises while others like att claim that they can provide their video services without a local cable franchise notwithstanding their positions both att and verizon have filed for video service franchise certificates under recent state franchising legislation see “legislation and regulation” below 

other wireline providers we operate our cable systems under nonexclusive franchises that are issued by a local community governing body such as a city council or county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to ilecs various companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing communications services these and other wireline communications systems offer video and other communications services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

satellite master antenna television systems our cable systems also compete for subscribers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv operators offer packages of video internet and phone services to residential and commercial developments 

broadcast subscription services local television broadcasters in a few of our service areas sell digital subscription services these services typically include a limited number of video programming services for a monthly fee 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of other companies many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  



  

   

the deployment of digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to subscribers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dialup modems ilecs and other companies offer dsl service and several of them have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some ilecs such as att and verizon have built and are continuing to build fiberopticbased networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering these higher speed services in many of our markets the fcc has reduced the obligations of ilecs to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless phone companies are offering wireless highspeed internet services in addition in a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports wireless wifi and wimax internet service is available numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and wimax internet access networks 

a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we reached access agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps although to date these isps have made limited use of their rights we cannot provide any assurance however that regulatory authorities will not impose socalled “open access” or similar requirements on us as part of an industrywide requirement additionally congress and the fcc are considering creating certain rights for internet content providers and for users of highspeed internet services by 

imposing “net neutrality” requirements on service providers these requirements could adversely affect our highspeed internet business see “ legislation and regulation ” below 

we expect competition for highspeed internet service subscribers to remain intense with companies competing on service availability price product features customer service transmission speeds and bundled services 

phone services 

our digital phone service and our circuitswitched local phone service compete against ilecs wireless phone service providers competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other voip service providers the ilecs have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

we anticipate that by the end of 2008 approximately 91 of our homes passed will have access to our digital phone service we expect some of our circuitswitched phone subscribers to migrate to our digital phone service as we phase out our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 the competitive nature of the phone business may negatively affect demand for and pricing of our phone services 

advertising 

we compete against a wide variety of media for the sale of advertising including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional cable television networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and internet sites 

 

programming segment 

 

the table below presents a summary of our most significant consolidated national programming networks as of december 31 2007 

 

  

revenue for our programming networks is primarily generated from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by mvpds that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our programming networks to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both our programming networks assist distributors with ongoing marketing and promotional activities to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our programming networks by larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of such distributors could have a material adverse effect on our programming networks 

  

   

sources of supply 

our programming networks often produce their own television programs and broadcasts of live events this often requires us to acquire the rights to the content that is used in such productions such as rights to screenplays or sporting events in other cases our programming networks license the cable telecast rights to television programs produced by third parties 

competition 

our programming networks compete with other television programming services for distribution and programming in addition our programming networks compete for audience share with all other forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast networks local broadcast stations pay and other cable networks home video payperview and video on demand services and internet sites finally our programming networks compete for advertising revenue with other national and local media including other television networks television stations radio stations newspapers internet sites and direct mail 

other businesses 

 

our other business interests include comcast spectacor and comcast interactive media comcast spectacor owns the philadelphia flyers the philadelphia 76ers and two large multipurpose arenas in philadelphia and manages other facilities for sporting events concerts and other events comcast interactive media develops and operates comcast’s internet businesses focused on entertainment information and communication including comcastnet fancast theplatform and fandango 

we also own noncontrolling interests in mgm in demand tv one pbs kids sprout fearnet new england cable news pittsburgh cable news channel music choice and sterling entertainment sportsnet new york 

legislation and regulation 

our cable segment is subject to regulation by federal state and local governmental authorities under federal and state laws and regulations as well as agreements we enter into with franchising authorities the communications act and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable segment including cable system ownership video subscriber rates carriage of broadcast television stations the way we sell our programming packages to subscribers access to cable system channels by franchising authorities and other parties the use of utility poles and conduits and the offering of our highspeed internet and phone services our programming segment is subject to more limited governmental regulation 

federal regulation and regulatory scrutiny of our cable and programming segments has been increasing under the current fcc 

even as the cable industry is subject to increasing competition from dbs providers telephone companies and others for video highspeed internet and phone services meanwhile the fcc has provided regulatory relief and other regulatory advantages to our competitors regulatory policies present significant adverse risks to our businesses 

the most significant regulatory developments during 2007 were the adoption of a cable ownership limit the implementation of fcc regulations constraining our provision of settop boxes the expansion of mustcarry and leased access obligations the extension of program access obligations the abrogation of exclusivity provisions in our access contracts with mdus and other private real estate developments the enactment of legislation by several states to provide statewide or simplified local franchising and the enactment or application by several states of new or additional taxes in addition there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals pending that could adversely affect our cable business including proposed rules on twoway plugandplay equipment expanded obligations for program access and program carriage further mustcarry requirements and increased pole attachment rates 

video services 

 

ownership limits 

the fcc has adopted an order establishing a 30 limit on the percentage of multichannel video subscribers that any single cable provider can serve nationwide because we currently serve approximately 26 of multichannel video subscribers nationwide the 30 ownership limit constrains our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities a federal appellate court struck down a similar 30 limit in a 2001 decision and we expect to appeal the new limit in court the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate a limit on the number of affiliated programming networks a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the fcc’s previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels was also struck down by the federal appellate court in the 2001 decision the percentage of affiliated programming networks we currently carry is well below the previous 40 limit it is uncertain when the fcc will rule on this issue or how any regulation it adopts might affect our cable segment 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and fcc regulations and policies limit the prices that cable operators may charge for limited basic service equipment and installation as well as the manner in which cable operators may package premium or payperview services with other tiers of service these rules do not apply to cable systems that the fcc determines are subject to effective competition but to date the fcc has made this determination for only a few of our cable systems we currently have pending before the fcc many petitions for determination of effective competition from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new 

  

   

pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals that would require cable operators to offer programming services on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings as discussed under “ legal proceedings ” in item 3 we are currently involved in litigation that could force us to offer programming services on an a la carte basis additionally uniform pricing requirements under the communications act may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for retransmission consent which may enable popular stations to demand cash payments or other significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks affiliated with the broadcaster as a condition of transmitting the tv broadcast signals that video subscribers expect to receive as part of the transition from analog to digital broadcast transmission congress and the fcc gave each local broadcast station a digital channel capable of carrying multiple programming streams in addition to its current analog channel after the broadcasters’ transition to digital on february 17 2009 cable operators will have to carry the primary digital programming stream of local broadcast stations and under recently adopted rules will also have to carry an analog version of the primary digital programming stream through at least february 17 2012 these new rules have been challenged in federal court the fcc is also considering proposals to require cable operators to carry after the 2009 transition date some or all of the multiple programming streams transmitted in the broadcaster’s digital signal such expanded mustcarry obligations would further constrain our ability to allocate cable bandwidth to more highdefinition channels faster internet speeds and other services in addition the fcc is considering proposals that would require cable operators to carry certain low power broadcast television stations that under current regulations generally lack mustcarry rights 

program accesslicense agreements 

the communications act and the fcc’s program access rules generally prevent video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds such as dbs providers and limit the ability of such affiliated programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2012 we have challenged this fcc action in federal court in addition the communications act and the fcc’s program carriage rules prohibit cable operators and other mvpds from requiring a financial interest in or exclusive distribution rights for any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated program 

ming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is considering proposals to expand its program access and program carriage regulations that if adopted could have an adverse effect on our businesses in addition under the fcc’s july 2006 order approving our acquisition of adelphia cable systems and related time warner transactions until july 2012 our regional sports networks are generally covered by the program access rules regardless of the means of delivery and mvpds may invoke commercial arbitration against such regional sports networks as an alternative to filing a program access complaint at the fcc the adelphia order also authorized unaffiliated regional sports networks to submit carriage claims against us to commercial arbitration but the fcc subsequently suspended that condition in light of its rulemaking to consider industrywide modifications to the program carriage rules 

leased access 

the communications act requires a cable system to make available up to 15 of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator to date we have not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access however the fcc recently adopted rules that dramatically reduce the rates we can charge for leased access channels although the lower rates initially will not apply to home shopping or infomercial programmers the fcc has issued a further notice to determine if such programming should also have the benefit of the lower rates these new fcc rules could adversely affect our business by significantly increasing the number of cable system channels occupied by leased access users and by significantly increasing the administrative burdens and costs associated with complying with such rules 

cable equipment 

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services effective july 2007 cable operators were prohibited from acquiring for deployment settop boxes that perform both channel navigation and security functions settop boxes purchased after that date must rely on a separate security device known as a cablecard which adds to the cost of settop boxes we sought a waiver from this regulation for certain lowcost limitedcapability settop boxes the fcc denied the waiver request and we have appealed that decision in court denial of the waiver request impedes our ability to transition analog customers to digital and reclaim analog spectrum for new hdtv channels and other innovative services in addition the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of plugandplay tv sets that can connect directly to a cable network and receive oneway analog and digital video services without the need for a settop box we believe that we are substantially in compliance with these oneway plugandplay requirements the 

  

   

fcc is also considering proposals to establish regulations for plugandplay retail devices that can access twoway cable ser vices some of the proposals if adopted would impose substantial costs on us and impair our ability to innovate 

mdus and inside wiring 

the fcc adopted an order prohibiting the enforcement of exclusive video service access agreements between cable operators and mdus and other private real estate developments the order also prohibits the execution of new exclusive access agreements the order has been appealed by the national cable  telecommunications association “ncta” our trade organization the fcc is also considering proposals to extend these prohibitions to noncable mvpds and to expand the scope of the rules to prohibit exclusive marketing and bulk billing agreements because we have a significant number of exclusive access agreements the fcc’s order to abrogate the exclusivity provisions of those agreements could negatively affect our business as would adoption of new limits on exclusive marketing and bulk billing the fcc has also adopted rules facilitating competitors’ access to the cable wiring inside such mdus this order which has also been appealed by the ncta could also have an adverse impact on our business as it allows our competitors to use wiring we have deployed to reach potential customers more quickly and inexpensively 

pole attachments 

the communications act permits the fcc to regulate the rate that poleowning utility companies with the exception of municipal utilities and rural cooperatives charge cable systems for attachments to their poles states are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the terms of attachments themselves and many states in which we operate have done so most of these states have generally followed the fcc’s pole rate standards the fcc or a state could increase pole attachment rates paid by cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we could face materially higher pole attachment costs in november 2007 the fcc initiated a proceeding to consider whether to modify its rules governing prices for pole attachments among other issues the fcc is considering establishing a new unified pole attachment rate that would apply to cable system attachments where the cable operator provides highspeed internet services and perhaps phone services as well the proposed rate would be higher than the current rate paid by cable service providers but lower than the rate that applies to attachments used to provide telecommunications services if adopted this proposal could materially increase our costs by increasing our existing payments for pole attachments 

  

franchising 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act permits franchising authorities to establish reasonable requirements for public educational and governmental access programming and many of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

there has been considerable activity at both the federal and state levels addressing franchise requirements imposed on new entrants this activity is primarily directed at facilitating ilec entry into cable service in december 2006 the fcc adopted new rules designed to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants by among other things limiting the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants requiring franchising authorities to act on franchise applications by new entrants within 90 days and preempting certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements these rules are the subject of an appeal filed by franchising authorities and ncta in federal court the fcc has adopted more modest franchising relief for existing cable operators we could be materially disadvantaged if the rules continue to set a different less burdensome standard for some of our competitors than for ourselves from time to time congress has also considered proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for ilecs and other new entrants we cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what effect it would have 

in addition many of the states in which we operate have enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants thus relieving new entrants of many of the local franchising burdens faced by incumbent operators some of these statutes also allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations for instance by not requiring that the applicant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the applicant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve certain of these state statutes allow incumbent cable operators to opt into the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent’s franchise area however even in those states where incumbent cable operators are allowed to opt into a state franchise we often are required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise 

  

   

copyright regulation 

in exchange for filing reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs the us copyright office has issued a notice of inquiry on issues relating to the calculation of compulsory license fees that could significantly affect the amount we pay further the us copyright office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create including our cable segment’s local advertising and local origination programming and our programming segment’s original programs these licensing fees have been the source of litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 

highspeed internet services 

 

we provide highspeed internet services by means of our existing cable systems in 2002 the fcc ruled that this was an interstate information service that is not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation however our highspeed internet services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations including compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” requirement that highspeed internet service providers must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity 

in addition congress and the fcc are considering defining certain rights for users of highspeed internet services and regulating or restricting some types of commercial agreements between service providers and providers of internet content these proposals are generally referred to as “net neutrality” in august 2005 the fcc issued a nonbinding policy statement identifying four principles that will guide its policymaking regarding highspeed internet and related services these principles provide that consumers are entitled to i access lawful internet content of their choice ii run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement iii connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and iv enjoy competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers several parties are advocating that the fcc adopt these principles as formal rules in addition some parties have alleged that our highspeed internet network management practices violate the fcc’s “net neutrality” principles and requested that the 

fcc adopt rules declaratory rulings or even penalties to change these practices further congress and some states are considering legislation that would establish “net neutrality” rules or impose additional obligations on highspeed internet providers any such rules or statutes could limit our ability to manage our cable systems including use for other services obtain value for use of our cable systems or respond to competitive conditions we cannot predict the outcome of the fcc proceedings or whether “net neutrality” rules or statutes will be adopted 

a federal program generally applicable to telecommunications services known as the universal service program requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on their revenues in recent years roughly 10 of revenues into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet and telecommunications services to schools libraries and certain health care providers the fcc and congress are considering revisions to the universal service program that could result in highspeed internet services being subject to universal service fees we cannot predict whether or how the universal service funding system might be extended to cover highspeed internet services or if that occurs how it will affect us 

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email state and local governments have also adopted internetrelated regulations furthermore congress the fcc and certain local governments are also considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service privacy and standard pricing regulations on highspeed internet service providers it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business 

phone services 

 

we currently offer phone services using interconnected voip technology and circuitswitched technology the fcc has adopted a number of orders addressing regulatory issues relating to interconnected voip providers in november 2004 the fcc ruled that a particular form of voip service is not subject to state or local utility regulation but has not yet ruled on the appropriate classification of interconnected voip services the state regulatory environment for interconnected voip therefore remains uncertain in september 2006 the staff of the missouri public service commission filed a complaint with that commission alleging that our interconnected voip service was being offered as telecommunications in missouri without a certificate of authority we challenged in federal court the commission’s ability to adjudicate the complaint 

  

   

in january 2007 the court ruled that the fcc had not yet specifically preempted state or local utility regulation of cabledelivered interconnected voip services and permitted the complaint to move forward in november 2007 the missouri commission ruled that its enabling statute required it to regulate our interconnected voip services the commission denied our request to reconsider that ruling and we have appealed the commission’s ruling in federal court in addition the vermont public service board has opened a proceeding for the review of voip services in vermont 

in april 2007 the fcc extended its customer proprietary network information requirements to interconnected voip providers in june 2007 the fcc held that the disability access requirements that currently apply to telecommunications carriers also apply to providers of interconnected voip services in november 2007 the fcc extended local number portability requirements and benefits to interconnected voip providers and their competitive local exchange carrier numbering partners these requirements are in addition to prior requirements imposed on interconnected voip by the fcc including e911 calea and universal service 

the fcc has initiated other rulemakings to consider whether to impose further regulations on interconnected voip providers for example in one rulemaking it would impose on interconnected voip and telecommunications carriers a 48hour number porting interval 

the fcc and congress are also considering how interconnected voip services should interconnect with ilec’s phone networks since the fcc has not determined the appropriate classification of interconnected voip service the precise scope of ilec interconnection rules applicable to interconnected voip providers is not entirely clear as a result some ilecs may resist interconnecting directly with interconnected voip providers in light of these concerns voip service providers typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to ilec networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right to deal with ilecs is clear we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs and through third party clecs it is uncertain whether and when the fcc or congress will adopt further rules in this area and how such rules would affect our interconnected voip service 

our circuit  switched phone service is subject to federal state and local utility regulation although the level of regulation imposed on us is generally less than that applied to the incumbent phone companies the scope of ilec obligations is however being reevaluated at the fcc and in congress the fcc has already adopted measures relieving ilecs of certain obligations to make elements of their networks available to competitors at costbased rates the fcc has also initiated rulemakings on intercarrier compensation universal service and other matters that in the aggregate could significantly change the rules that apply to phone competitors including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers long  distance and local providers and incumbents and new entrants it is unclear how 

these proceedings will affect our phone services we plan to phase out our circuitswitched phone service in 2008 in accordance with applicable federal and state regulatory rules 

other areas 

 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable segment and limited aspects of our programming segment including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards political advertising indecent or obscene programming emergency alert system requirements for analog and digital services e911 capabilities and calea obligations for interconnected voip and circuitswitched service closed captioning requirements for the hearing impaired commercial restrictions on children’s programming origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator sponsorship identification equal employment opportunity lottery programming recordkeeping and public file access requirements telemarketing and technical standards relating to operation of the cable network we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and programming businesses 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on the services we offer or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes are computed these include combined reporting on other changes to general business taxes central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on video and voice services other cable industry members are challenging certain of these taxes in court in addition in some situations our dbs competitors do not face similar state tax and fee burdens 

privacy regulation 

the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of subscribers’ personal information by cable operators and phone providers additional requirements may be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy standards 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 100000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 86000 were associated with our cable business and the remainder were associated with our programming and other businesses approximately 5000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

  

   

caution concerning forwardlooking 

statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that those statements are only our predictions in evaluating those statements you should specifically consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “ risk factors” under item 1a and in other reports we file with the sec actual events or our actual results may differ materially from any of our forwardlooking statements 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations because of changes in such factors other factors and risks could adversely affect our operations business or financial results of our businesses in the future and could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

all of the services offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers we compete directly with other programming distributors including dbs companies phone companies companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve and companies that offer programming and other communications services to our subscribers and potential subscribers including highspeed internet and voip service providers this competition intensified during the second half of 2007 and may adversely affect our business and results of operations in the future 

  

we may face increased competition because of technological advances and new regulatory requirements which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

in addition to marketing dbs services in certain areas ilecs have built and are continuing to build wireline fiberopticbased networks and in some cases are using ip technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas ilecs and other companies also offer dsl and other internet services we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future new technologies and services may develop that compete with services that our cable systems offer and such services may not be regulated in the same manner or to the same extent as our services the success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business and operations moreover in recent years congress and various states have enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies that have had the effect of providing a more favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors 

programming expenses are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future the mvpd industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming especially sports programming if we are unable to raise our subscribers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition as we add programming to our video services we face increased programming expenses 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers we cannot predict the impact of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we fail to obtain the required consents 

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose additional costs and restrictions 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry and may increase the regulation of the internet services and digital phone services industries we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases adversely effect the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises 

  

   

from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition of renewal or transfer and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in addition we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if telephone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us for example the fcc has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants congress and the fcc are also considering various forms of “net neutrality” regulation see “ legislation and regulation ” in item 1 and refer to the “ franchising ” and “ highspeed internet services ” discussion within that section 

weakening economic conditions may reduce subscriber spending on video internet and phone services and may reduce our rate of growth of subscriber additions 

a substantial portion of our revenues comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions the weakening economy affected our net subscriber additions during the second half of 2007 and if these economic conditions continue to deteriorate the growth of our business and results of operations may be affected 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are involved in various litigation matters including those arising in the ordinary course of business and those described under the caption “legal proceedings” in item 3 while we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we have made acquisitions and have entered into other strategic transactions in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other stockholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other stockholders these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock 

brian l roberts beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our operations and has the ability subject to certain restrictions through november 17 2012 to transfer potential effective control by selling the class b common stock in addition under our articles of incorporation mr roberts is entitled to remain as our chairman chief executive officer and president until may 26 2010 unless he is removed by the affirmative vote of at least 75 of the entire board of directors or he is no longer willing or able to serve

 item 7 management’s discussion and 

analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction and overview 

 

we are the largest cable operator in the united states and offer a variety of entertainment and communications products and services as of december 31 2007 our cable systems served approximately 241 million video subscribers 132 million highspeed internet subscribers and 46 million phone subscribers and passed approximately 485 million homes in 39 states and the district of columbia 

we classify our operations in two reportable segments cable and programming our cable segment which generates approximately 95 of our consolidated revenues manages and operates our cable systems our programming segment consists primarily of our national programming networks during 2007 our operations generated consolidated revenues of approximately 309 billion 

our cable segment earns revenues primarily through subscriptions to our video highspeed internet and phone services “cable services” we market our cable services individually and as bundled services primarily to residential customers we are beginning to offer bundled cable services to small and mediumsized businesses our video services range from a limited basic service and a digital starter service to our full digital cable service our full digital cable service provides access to over 250 channels including premium and payperview channels video on demand which allows access to a library of movies sports and news and the ability to start a selection at any time and to pause rewind and fastforward selections music channels and an interactive onscreen program guide which allows the subscriber to navigate the channel lineup and the video on demand library digital cable subscribers may also subscribe to additional digital cable services including digital video recorder “dvr” which allows digital recording of programs and pausing and rewinding of “live” television and highdefinition television “hdtv” which provides multiple channels in high definition as of december 31 2007 approximately 50 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video service and approximately 63 of those video subscribers subscribed to at least one of our digital cable services our highspeed internet service provides internet access at downstream speeds of up to 16 mbps depending on the level of service selected as of december 31 2007 approximately 28 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet service our digital phone service provides unlimited local and domestic longdistance calling and other features and is our most recent cable service offering as of december 31 2007 approximately 10 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our digital phone service in addition to cable services other 

cable segment revenue sources include advertising and the operations of our regional sports and news networks 

our programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks including e the golf channel versus g4 and style revenue from our programming segment is earned primarily from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” 

our other business interests include comcast spectacor and comcast interactive media comcast spectacor owns the philadelphia flyers the philadelphia 76ers and two large multipurpose arenas in philadelphia and manages other facilities for sporting events concerts and other events comcast interactive media develops and operates comcast’s internet businesses focused on entertainment information and communication including comcastnet fancast theplatform and fandango comcast spectacor comcast interactive media and all other consolidated businesses not included in our cable or programming segments are included in “corporate and other” activities 

we operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment we compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of dbs operators and telephone companies in 2007 many of these competitors have expanded their service areas added features and adopted aggressive pricing and packaging for services and features that are comparable to the services and features we offer 

a substantial portion of our revenues comes from residential subscribers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net subscriber additions during the second half of 2007 and may if these conditions continue adversely impact our results of operations in the future 

2007 developments 

  



  

   

  

   

  

 further details of our consolidated financial statements including discussion of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources are presented below 

 

 

the areas we serve 

the map below highlights our 40 major markets with emphasis on our operations in the top 25 us tv markets approximately 92 of our video subscribers are in the markets listed subscribers in thousands 

  

   

consolidated operating results 

 

the comparability of our results of operations and subscriber information is impacted by the effects of the houston transaction in january 2007 the acquisition of patriot media in august 2007 the adelphia and time warner transactions in july 2006 the acquisition of the cable systems of susquehanna communications in april 2006 and other smaller acquisitions we collectively refer to the cable systems acquired in these transactions as the “newly acquired cable systems” the newly acquired cable systems contributed 81000 video subscribers 58000 highspeed internet subscribers and 16000 phone subscribers in 2007 the newly acquired cable systems contributed 35 million video subscribers 17 million highspeed internet subscribers and 173000 phone subscribers in 2006 including the cable system serving houston texas for cable segment purposes see “segment operating results” below as a result of transferring our previously owned cable systems located in los angeles cleveland and dallas “comcast exchange systems” as part of the adelphia and time warner transactions the operating results of the comcast exchange systems are reported as discontinued operations for 2006 and 2005 the comparability of our results of operations is also impacted by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” on january 1 2006 see item 8 note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

 all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

 

consolidated revenues 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated revenues for 2007 and 2006 cable segment and programming segment revenues are discussed separately below in “segment operating results” the remaining changes relate to our other business activities primarily comcast spectacor and growth in comcast interactive media 

  

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses 

our cable and programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 cable segment and programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses are discussed separately below in “segment operating results” the remaining changes relate to our other business activities including expanding our comcast interactive media business the settlement of litigation in 2007 and player contract termination costs at comcast spectacor in 2007 

  

   

consolidated depreciation and amortization 

the increases in depreciation expense for 2007 and 2006 are primarily a result of the effects of capital expenditures by our cable segment which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately 700 million and 100 million respectively and acquisitions of cable systems which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately 530 million and 200 million respectively 

the increase in amortization expense for 2007 is primarily a result of the increases in the amortization of our franchiserelated customer relationship intangible assets associated with our newly acquired cable systems purchases of softwarerelated intangibles and the writedown of intangible assets of approximately 30 million related to the planned shutdown of the azn network in 2008 the decrease in amortization expense for 2006 is primarily a result of decreases in the amortization of our franchiserelated customer relationship intangible assets which were partially offset by increased amortization expense related to softwarerelated intangibles acquired in various transactions and the newly acquired cable systems 

segment operating results 

 

certain adjustments have been made in our 2005 and 2006 segment presentation to be consistent with our 2007 management reporting presentation these adjustments are primarily related to certain segment reclassifications and are further discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements the cable segment includes the operating results for the houston cable system beginning august 1 2006 however the operating results of the houston cable system were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 as we continued to account for texas and kansas city cable partners as an equity method investment for external financial reporting purposes until the houston cable system was acquired on january 1 2007 

to measure the performance of our operating segments we use operating income before depreciation and amortization excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations it is also unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive 

compensation programs we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements  see note 15  you should not consider this measure a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap 

cable segment overview 

our cable systems simultaneously deliver video highspeed internet and phone services to our subscribers the majority of our cable segment revenue is earned from subscriptions to these cable services subscribers typically pay us monthly based on their chosen level of service number of services and features and the type of equipment they use and generally may discontinue service at any time our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of the effects of our recent acquisitions continued demand for our products and services including our bundled offerings as well as other factors discussed below the newly acquired cable systems accounted for approximately 26 billion and 17 billion of the increases in revenues in 2007 and 2006 respectively however intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net subscriber additions during the second half of 2007 and may if these conditions continue adversely impact our results of operations in 2008 including as a result of a decline in the number of subscribers to our basic cable services 

  

   

cable segment results of operations 

 

  

cable segment revenues 

video we offer a full range of video services ranging from a limited basic service and a digital starter service to our full digital cable service digital cable subscribers may also subscribe to additional digital cable services including dvr and hdtv as of december 31 2007 63 of our video subscribers subscribed to at least one of our digital cable services compared to 52 and 45 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

revenues increased as a result of higher pricing on our basic video service subscriber growth in our digital cable services including demand for digital features such as video on demand dvr and hdtv and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems during 2007 and 2006 we added approximately 25 million and 19 million digital cable subscribers respectively while the number of basic subscribers decreased by 180000 in 2007 in 2007 approximately 16 billion of the increases in our video revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2006 the amount was approximately 11 billion our average monthly video revenue per video subscriber increased from approximately 53 in 2005 to approximately 57 in 2006 and to approximately 61 in 2007 

  

highspeed internet we offer highspeed internet service with internet access at downstream speeds of up to 16 mbps depending on the level of service selected this service also includes our interactive portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of proprietary content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet services we provide 

revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 as a result of subscriber growth and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems as of december 31 2007 28 of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our highspeed internet service compared to 25 and 21 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively in 2007 approximately 640 million of the increases in our highspeed internet revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2006 the amount was approximately 370 million average monthly revenue per highspeed internet subscriber has remained relatively stable between 42 and 43 from 2005 through 2007 

  

   

phone we offer our interconnected voip digital phone service that provides unlimited local and domestic longdistance calling and includes such features as voice mail caller id and call waiting our digital phone service was available to approximately 42 million or 87 of the homes in the areas we serve as of december 31 2007 we expect that by the end of 2008 approximately 91 of our homes passed will have access to our digital phone service in some areas we provide circuitswitched local phone service 

revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 as a result of increases in the number of digital phone subscribers these increases were partially offset by the loss of approximately 470000 and 330000 circuitswitched phone subscribers in 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2007 approximately 100 million of the increases in our phone revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems in 2006 the amount was 40 million our circuitswitched phone service subscribers will continue to decrease as we phase out this service in 2008 

 

advertising as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in other markets we have formed and operate advertising interconnects which establish a physical direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator 

advertising revenues increased in 2007 as a result of our newly acquired cable systems absent the growth from the newly acquired cable systems advertising revenue decreased slightly in 2007 reflecting continued weakness across the television advertising market a decline in political advertising and one less week in the broadcast calendar during 2007 advertising revenue increased in 2006 as a result of strong political advertising and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems 

  

other we also generate revenues from our regional sports and news networks installation services commissions from thirdparty electronic retailing and fees for other services such as providing businesses with data connectivity and networked applications our regional sports and news networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast cn8 — the comcast network comcast sportsnet chicago comcast sportsnet west sacramento comcast sportsnet northwest comcast sportsnet new england boston bay area sportsnet san francisco and comcast mountainwest sports network these networks earn revenue through the sale of advertising time and receive programming license fees paid by mvpds 

other revenues increased in 2007 as a result of our regional sports network acquisitions and our newly acquired cable systems other revenues increased in 2006 as a result of the addition of our newly acquired cable systems 

franchise fees our franchise fee revenues represent the passthrough to our subscribers of the fees required to be paid to state and local franchising authorities under the terms of our franchise agreements we are generally required to pay an amount based on our gross video revenues to the local franchising authority the increases in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers are primarily a result of the increases in our revenues on which the fees apply 

total cable segment revenue as a result of the growth in revenues from our products and services we have been able to increase our total average monthly revenue per video subscriber including all cable segment revenue sources from approximately 82 in 2005 to approximately 95 in 2006 and to approximately 102 in 2007 

cable segment expenses 

we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses our operating margins operating income before depreciation and 

  

   

amortization as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 407 402 and 398 respectively 

 

 

cable segment operating expenses cable programming expenses our largest expense are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we package offer and distribute to our cable subscribers these expenses are affected by changes in the rates charged by programming networks the number of subscribers and the programming options we offer to subscribers cable programming expenses increased to 58 billion in 

2007 from 49 billion in 2006 and 41 billion in 2005 as a result of increases in rates and the newly acquired cable systems we anticipate our cable programming expenses will increase in the future as the fees charged by programming networks increase and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our subscribers 

other operating expenses increased to 46 billion in 2007 from 36 billion in 2006 and 29 billion in 2005 in 2007 and 2006 our newly acquired cable systems contributed approximately 950 million and 650 million respectively to the increases in other operating expenses the remaining increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily a result of the growth in the number of subscribers which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide inhouse customer support and costs associated with the delivery of those services 

cable segment selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased to approximately 70 billion in 2007 in 2007 and 2006 our newly acquired cable systems contributed approximately 450 million and 400 million respectively to our increases in cable segment selling general and administrative expenses the remaining increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily a result of additional employees needed to provide customer and other administrative services as well as additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining subscribers

programming segment results of operations 

 

   

   

programming segment revenues 

programming revenues for 2007 and 2006 increased as a result of continued growth in advertising driven by strong ratings and growth in affiliate and international revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 11 to 13 of our programming segment revenues were generated from our cable segment these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above 

programming segment operating selling general and administrative expenses 

operating selling general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events the purchase of programming rights the marketing and promotion of our programming networks and administrative costs programming expenses for 2007 2006 and 2005 increased as a result of an increase in the production of and programming rights costs for new and liveevent programming for our programming networks including the pga tour on the golf channel and the nhl on versus as well as a corresponding increase in marketing expenses for this programming we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new and liveevent programming that will cause our programming segment expenses to increase in the future 

consolidated other income expense items 

 

 

 interest expense 

the increases in interest expense for 2007 from 2006 were primarily the result of increases in our average debt outstanding the increase for 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding and higher interest rates on our variablerate debt as well as 57 million of gains recognized in 2005 in connection with the early extinguishment of some of our debt facilities 

investment income loss net 

the components of investment income loss net for 2007 2006 and 2005 are presented in a table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in connection with the adelphia and time warner transactions we recognized investment income of approximately 646 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of substantially all of our investments accounted for as trading securities the differences between the unrealized gains losses on trading securities and the mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities as presented in the table in note 6 result from one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 equity in net losses income of affiliates net 

the decrease in equity in net losses of affiliates for 2007 from 2006 and the increase in equity in net losses of affiliates for 2006 from 2005 were primarily a result of 59 million of otherthantemporary impairment charges recognized in 2006 

other income expense 

other income for 2007 consists primarily of a gain of approximately 500 million on the sale of our 50 interest in the kansas city asset pool in connection with the houston transaction other income for 2006 consists primarily of 170 million of gains on the sales of investment assets other expense for 2005 consists primarily of a 170 million payment representing our share of the settlement amount related to certain of att’s litigation with at home partially offset by a 24 million gain on the exchange of one of our equity method investments and 62 million of gains recognized on the sale or restructuring of investment assets 

  

   

income tax expense 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2007 2006 and 2005 was 414 375 and 507 respectively income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions our tax rate in 2006 was impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions primarily related to the favorable resolution of issues and revised estimates of the outcome of unresolved issues with various taxing authorities our tax rate in 2005 was impacted by taxes associated with other investments we expect our 2008 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 40 to 45 

discontinued operations 

 

the operating results of our previously owned cable systems located in los angeles dallas and cleveland which were reported as discontinued operations for 2006 and 2005 included seven months of operations in 2006 because the closing date of the transaction was july 31 2006 for 2005 results include 12 months of operations as a result of the exchange of these systems in the adelphia and time warner transactions we recognized a gain of 195 million net of tax of 541 million  see note 5  in 2006 the effective tax rate on the gain is higher than the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductible amounts attributed to goodwill 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our businesses generate significant cash flow from operating activities the proceeds from monetizing our nonstrategic investments have also provided us with a significant source of cash flow we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flow from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and through our ability to obtain future external financing we anticipate continuing to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to fund our capital expenditures invest in business opportunities and return capital to investors through stock repurchases and dividends the credit markets have been and continue to be volatile due primarily to difficulties in the residential mortgage markets as well as the slowing economy we do not hold any cash equivalents or shortterm investments whose liquidity or value has been affected by these negative trends in the financial markets 

  

operating activities 

details of cash provided by operating activities are presented in the table below 

 



  

   

in 2007 we sold 603 million of trading securities proceeds from sales of trading securities are presented within cash provided by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these amounts are not related to operations but result from the sales of investments 

the increase in interest payments from 2005 to 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding 

the increase in tax payments from 2005 to 2007 was primarily the result of the effects of increases in income sales of investments and the settlement of federal and state tax audits 

financing activities 

net cash provided by used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings offset by our debt repayments and our repurchases of our class a and class a special common stock we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities including details of our debt repayments and borrowings 

longterm debt borrowings repayments and redemptions 

proceeds from borrowings fluctuates from year to year based on the levels of acquisitions and scheduled debt repayments 

the higher level of borrowings in 2006 was primarily a result of the houston transaction the adelphia and time warner transactions the acquisition of the remaining portion of e entertainment television that we did not already own and our investment in spectrumco llc “spectrumco” 

available borrowings under credit facilities 

we traditionally maintain significant availability under lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2007 amounts available under these facilities totaled approximately 4370 billion in january 2008 we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility which may be used for general corporate purposes this amendment increased the size of the credit facility from 50 billion to 70 billion and extended the maturity of the loan commitment from october 2010 to january 2013 

  

debt covenants 

we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees  see note 17  are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital our credit facilities’ covenants are tested on an ongoing basis the only financial covenant in our 50 billion revolving credit facility and our amended and restated 70 billion revolving credit facility relates to leverage ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2007 we met our financial covenant in our 5 billion revolving credit facility by a significant margin our ability to comply with this financial covenant in the future does not depend on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 

share repurchase program and dividends 

in october 2007 our board of directors authorized a 7 billion addition to our existing share repurchase program as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 69 billion of availability remaining under the share repurchase authorization which we intend to fully utilize by the end of 2009 subject to market conditions on february 13 2008 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 00625 per share which will be payable in april 2008 this represents the first payment of a planned annual dividend of 025 per share 

 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures acquisitions and investments partially offset by proceeds from sales and restructurings of investments 

  

   

capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable segment and we expect that this will continue in the future a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of growth and the technology being deployed the following table summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment from 2005 through 2007 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

cable capital expenditures increased 412 from 2006 to 2007 and 245 from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of the rollout of our digital phone service and an increase in demand for advanced settop boxes including dvr and hdtv and highspeed internet modems these increases were accelerated by the introduction of our triple play bundle in late 2005 and as a result of regulatory changes in 2007 we also incurred additional capital expenditures in our newly acquired cable systems in anticipation of this growth we have continued to improve the capacity and reliability of our network in order to handle the additional volume and advanced services we have also expanded our service area through line extensions and now pass more than 48 million homes 

the amounts of capital expenditures in our programming segment and our other business activities have not been significant consolidated 2007 capital expenditures include approximately 110 million related to the consolidation of offices in pennsylvania and relocation of our corporate headquarters the amounts of our capital expenditures for 2008 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors including acquisitions competition changes in technology regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services 

acquisitions 

in 2007 acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisitions of patriot media sports channel new england bay area sportsnet and fandango in 2006 acquisitions were primarily related to the adelphia and time warner transactions the acquisition of the cable systems of susquehanna communications and the acquisition of our additional interest in e entertainment television 

proceeds from sale of investments 

in 2007 and 2006 proceeds from the sales and restructurings of investments were primarily related to the disposition of our ownership interests in time warner inc 

purchases of investments 

in 2007 purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in insight midwest lp and our purchase of available for sale securities in 2006 purchases of investments were primarily related to the purchase of our interest in spectrumco and to our additional investment in texas and kansas city cable partners 

  

   

contractual obligations 

 

our unconditional contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 which consist primarily of our debt obligations and the associated payments due in future periods are presented in the table below 

 

 refer to note 8 longterm debt and note 14 commitments to our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

  

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets 

and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes and legal contingencies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them which are presented below 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

  

   

valuation and impairment tests of cable franchise rights 

our largest asset our cable franchise rights results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new subscribers and to market new services such as additional digital cable services and highspeed internet and phone services in a particular service area the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily the result of cable system acquisitions typically when we acquire a cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas we currently serve approximately 6000 franchise areas in the united states 

we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed its fair value the “impairment test” in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” 

we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment in developing individual assumptions including longterm growth rate and discount rate assumptions 

if we determine the value of our cable franchise rights is less than the carrying amount we recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets for the purpose of our impairment tests we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our five cable divisions or units of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment tests are performed at an appropriate level before 2007 we used our cable regions as the unit of account frequent reorganizations of our regions and further management centralization of our cable operations led us to conclude that our cable divisions are more reflective of how we manage and operate the assets and therefore are the appropriate unit of account consequently effective april 1 2007 our annual impairment test date we changed the unit of account to five cable divisions from 29 cable regions we tested for impairment at the region level before combining our regions into divisions to confirm that no impairment existed before the change we have not recorded any significant impairment charges as a result of our impairment tests a future change in the unit of account could result in recognition of an impairment charge 

  

we could record impairment charges in the future if there are longterm changes in market conditions expected future operating results or federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights for example increased competition and a slowdown in the economy impacted our operating results during the second half of 2007 assumptions made about the continuation of these market conditions on a longerterm basis could impact the valuations to be used in the april 1 2008 annual impairment test and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the april 1 2007 annual impairment test such assumptions and fair values will not be determined until the annual impairment test is performed the following table illustrates the impairment charge related to our various cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at our last annual impairment test date 

 

  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” effective january 1 2007 we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with this interpretation from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of 

  

   

the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent the effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period 

  

legal contingencies 

we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business and in certain cases those that we assume from an acquired entity in a business combination we record an estimated liability for those proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we review outstanding claims with internal as well as external counsel to assess the probability and the estimates of loss we reassess the risk of loss as new information becomes available and we adjust liabilities as appropriate the actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative 

disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk management 

 

we maintain a mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt approximately 95 of our total debt of 313 billion is at fixed rates with the remaining debt at variable rates we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses we do not engage in any speculative derivative transactions and we are not a party to any leveraged derivative instruments 

  

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant 

our interest rate derivative financial instruments which can include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 95 to 85 as of december 31 2007 the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments increased our interest expense by approximately 43 million and 39 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively and decreased our interest expense by approximately 16 million in 2005 interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

 

the table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2007 

 

   

   

we use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received the notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the payments necessary or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate “libor” for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on december 31 2007 plus the applicable margin in effect on december 31 2007 

as a matter of practice we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include creditratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the estimated fair value of those swaps was a liability of 3 million and 60 million respectively the amount to be paid or received upon termination if any would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time 

  

equity price risk management 

 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 

through market value and sensitivity analyses we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments we use equity derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments which are accounted for at fair value include equity collar agreements prepaid forward sales agreements and indexed or exchangeable debt instruments 

except as described above in “investment income loss net” the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to note 6 and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussions of our derivative financial instruments

digital cable our digital cable services consist of a digital starter cable service a full digital cable service and some specialty tiers with sports family or ethnic themes the digital starter cable service uses a digital settop box to deliver between 60 and 80 channels of video programming multiple music channels an interactive program guide and a partial on demand library full digital cable services also use a digital settop box to deliver over 250 channels of video programming multiple music channels an interactive program guide access to a full on demand library and multiple offerings from any premium channel programming purchased by the subscriber including programming that varies as to time of broadcast and theme of content 

video on demand our video on demand service which we refer to as on demand allows our digital starter cable and full digital cable subscribers the opportunity to choose from a library of programs start the programs at whatever time is convenient and pause rewind or fastforward the programs a substantial portion of our on demand content is available to our digital cable subscribers at no additional charge 

subscription video on demand our subscription video on demand service provides subscribers with on demand access to packages of programming that are either associated with a particular premium content provider to which they already subscribe such as hbo ondemand or are otherwise made available on a subscription basis certain selected packages of programming are available for an additional fee 

highdefinition television our hdtv service provides our digital cable subscribers with improved highresolution picture quality improved audio quality and a widescreen format our hdtv service offers a broad selection of highdefinition programming with access up to approximately 20 highdefinition channels including most major broadcast networks leading national cable networks premium channels and regional sports networks in addition our on demand service provides more than 150 hdtv programming choices 

digital video recorder our dvr service lets digital cable subscribers select record and store programs and play them at whatever time is convenient dvr service also provides the ability to pause and rewind “live” television 

premium channel programming our premium channel programming service which includes cable networks such as hbo showtime starz and cinemax generally offers without commercial interruption feature motion pictures live and taped sporting events concerts and other special features 

payperview programming our payperview service allows our cable subscribers to order for a separate fee individual movies and specialevent programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts on an unedited commercialfree basis 

highspeed internet services 

we offer highspeed internet service with internet access at downstream speeds from 6mbps to 16mbps depending on the level of service selected this service also includes our interactive portal comcastnet which 

  

provides multiple email addresses and online storage as well as a variety of proprietary content and valueadded features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet service we provide 

phone services 

we offer comcast digital voice our ipenabled phone service that provides unlimited local and domestic longdistance calling including features such as voice mail caller id and call waiting as of december 31 2006 comcast digital voice service was available to 32 million homes we anticipate that by the end of 2007 approximately 85 of our homes passed will have access to comcast digital voice 

in some areas we provide our circuitswitched local phone service subscribers to this service have access to a full array of calling features and thirdparty longdistance services at this time we are now focusing our marketing efforts on comcast digital voice 

advertising 

as part of our programming license agreements with programming networks we often receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local regional and national advertisers we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets and in other markets we have formed and operate advertising interconnects which establish a physical direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator 

regional sports and news networks 

our regional sports and news networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast cn8—the comcast network comcast sportsnet chicago mountainwest sports network and comcast sportsnet west sacramento these networks earn revenue through the sale of advertising time and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators and direct broadcast satellite “dbs” companies 

other revenue sources 

we also generate revenues from installation services commissions from thirdparty electronic retailing and from other services such as providing businesses with data connectivity and networked applications 

sources of supply 

to offer our video services we license from programming networks the substantial majority of the programming we distribute both channels and on demand programs for which we generally pay a monthly fee on a per video subscriber per channel basis we attempt to secure longterm licenses with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives for this programming we also license individual programs or packages of programs from program suppliers for our on demand service generally under shorterterm agreements 

our video programming expenses are increased by the growth in the number of video subscribers the increase in the number of channels and programs we provide and increases in license fees we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item and to increase in the future in recent years the cable and satellite television industries have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of programming particularly sports programming we anticipate that these increases may be mitigated to some extent by volume discounts 

to offer our highspeed internet portal service we license the software products such as email and content such as news feeds that we integrate into our service from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts in which we generally pay a monthly fee on a per subscriber or fixed fee basis 

  

to offer comcast digital voice we license the software products such as voice mail that we integrate into our service from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts and payment is based upon consumption of the related services 

customer and technical service 

we service our subscribers through local regional and national call and technical centers generally our call centers provide 247 callanswering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services function performs various tasks including installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

technology development 

historically we have relied on thirdparty hardware and software vendors for many of the technologies needed for the operation of our businesses the addition of new features to existing services and the development and commercialization of new service offerings in recent years we have begun developing strategically important software and technologies internally and integrating thirdparty software to our specifications we have arranged for longterm access rights to national fiberbased networks that we actively manage to interconnect our local and regional distribution systems and to facilitate the efficient delivery of our services we expect these efforts to continue and expand in the future these efforts require greater initial expenditures than would be required if we continued to purchase or license these products and services from third parties 

we have begun to explore various ways to offer wireless services we have entered into a strategic alliance with a wireless carrier to offer its wireless service integrated with our cable services and to develop technology that facilitates further integration we have also purchased our own wireless spectrum both directly and through a consortium we have not yet built any networks using our spectrum but we are exploring various strategies to utilize this spectrum to enhance our service offerings and offer new services 

sales and marketing 

we offer our products and services through direct customer contact through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising television advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets in 2006 we began marketing our video highspeed internet and comcast digital voice services in a package that we refer to as the “triple play” 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive environment we compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment where it is likely new technologies will further increase the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and our advertising business we expect advances in communications technology to continue in the future and we are unable to predict what effects these developments will have on our businesses and operations 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by ilecs in fiberoptic networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings furthermore congress and various state governments are considering measures that would reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including ilecs  certain of such franchising entry measures have already been adopted by the fcc and nine states we could be significantly disadvantaged if proposals to change franchising rules for our competitors but not for cable operators are approved and implemented see “legislation and regulation” below 

dbs systems according to recent government and industry reports conventional medium and highpower satellites currently provide video programming to over 29 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 300 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and echostar provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

highpower satellite service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outside antennas satellite systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals currently delivered to subscribers by dbs 

federal legislation establishes among other things a compulsory copyright license that permits satellite systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who reside in the local television station’s market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we serve additionally federal law generally provides satellite systems with access to cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite dbs providers are competitive with cable operators like us because they offer programming that closely resembles what we offer these dbs providers are also attempting to expand their service offerings to include among other things highspeed internet service and have entered into marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by ilecs 

  

ilecs ilecs in particular att and verizon are building fiberoptic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and have begun to offer this service in several of our service areas in addition to entering into joint marketing arrangements with dbs providers in certain areas the ilecs have taken various positions on the question of whether they need a local cable television franchise to provide video services some like verizon have applied for local cable franchises while others like att claim that they can provide their video services without a local cable franchise notwithstanding their positions both att and verizon have filed for video service franchise certificates pursuant to recent state franchising legislation see “legislation and regulation” below 

other wireline providers we operate our cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises that are issued by a local community governing body such as a city council or county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems in addition to ilecs various companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing communications services these and other wireline communications systems offer video and other communications services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

smatv  our cable systems also compete for subscribers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation like local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv operators are offering packages of phone internet access and video services to residential and commercial developments 

broadcast subscription services local television broadcasters in a few markets sell digital subscription services these services typically contain a limited number of cable programming services at a price of approximately 20 per month 

highspeed internet services 

we compete with a number of other companies many of which have substantial resources including 

 

  

  

  

 the deployment of digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to subscribers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of conventional modems ilecs and other companies offer dsl service and several of them have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some ilecs such as verizon and att are constructing fiberoptic networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology and are now offering such higher speed service in numerous markets the fcc has reduced the obligations of ilecs to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

various wireless phone companies are offering wireless highspeed internet services in addition in a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports wireless “wifi” and “wimax” internet access capability is available numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi and wimax internet access networks 

  

a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we reached access agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps although to date these isps have made limited use of their rights we cannot provide any assurance however that regulatory authorities will not impose socalled “open access” or similar requirements on us as part of an industrywide requirement additionally congress and the fcc are considering creating certain rights for internet content providers and for users of highspeed internet services by imposing “network neutrality” requirements upon service providers these requirements could adversely affect our highspeed internet services business see “legislation and regulation” below 

we expect competition for highspeed internet service subscribers to remain intense with companies competing on service availability price product features customer service transmission speed and bundled services 

phone services 

our comcast digital voice service and circuitswitched local phone service compete against ilecs wireless phone service providers competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other voiceoverip “voip” service providers the ilecs have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

we anticipate that by the end of 2007 approximately 85 of our homes passed will have access to comcast digital voice we expect some of our circuitswitched phone subscribers to migrate to our comcast digital voice service over the next several years the competitive nature of the phone business may negatively affect demand for and pricing of our phone services 

advertising 

we compete against a wide variety of media for sales of advertising including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional cable television networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and internet sites 

programming segment 

the table below presents information as of december 31 2006 relating to our consolidated national programming networks 

 

 revenue for our programming networks is principally generated from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators dbs companies and other multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our programming networks to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both our programming networks assist distributors with ongoing marketing and promotional activities to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers 

  

although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our programming networks by larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of such distributors could have a material effect on our programming networks 

sources of supply 

our programming networks often produce their own television programs and broadcasts of live events this often requires us to acquire the rights to the content that is used in such productions such as rights to screenplays or sporting events in other cases our programming networks license the cable telecast rights to television programs produced by third parties 

competition 

our programming networks compete with other television programming services for distribution and programming in addition our programming networks compete for audience share with all other forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast networks local broadcast stations pay and other cable networks home video payperview and video on demand services and online activities finally our programming networks compete for advertising revenue with other national and local media including other television networks television stations radio stations newspapers internet sites and direct mail 

other businesses 

in addition to our controlling interest in comcast spectacor which owns the philadelphia flyers the philadelphia 76ers and two large multipurpose arenas we also own noncontrolling interests in mgm in demand tv one pbs kids sprout fearnet sportschannel new england new england cable news pittsburgh cable news channel music choice and sterling entertainment 

legislation and regulation 

our video and phone services are subject to numerous requirements prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws and regulations local ordinances and our franchise agreements our highspeed internet service while not currently subject to significant regulation may be subject to such regulation in the future our programming businesses are with limited exceptions not subject to direct governmental regulation in addition our video services are subject to compliance with the terms of the fcc’s july 2006 order approving the adelphia and time warner transactions the “adelphia order” 

the most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act” the communications act and the regulations and policies of the fcc affect significant aspects of our cable system video services including cable system ownership video subscriber rates carriage of broadcast television stations the way we sell our programming packages to subscribers access to cable system channels by franchising authorities and other third parties and use of utility poles and conduits additionally the communications act and fcc regulations affect the offering of our highspeed internet services and phone services 

video services 

ownership limits the fcc is considering imposing “horizontal ownership limits” that would limit the percentage of video subscribers that any single cable provider could serve nationwide a federal appellate court struck down the previous 30 limit and the fcc is now considering this issue anew we serve approximately 

  

27 of multichannel video subscribers if the fcc were to reinstate ownership limits similar to those previously imposed such limits would restrict our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate “vertical ownership limits” on the number of affiliated programming networks a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels was also invalidated by the federal appellate court the percentage of affiliated programming networks we currently carry is well below the previous 40 limit but it is uncertain how any new vertical limits might affect our programming businesses in addition the fcc is considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules that would affect which cable subscribers are counted under any horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted under any vertical ownership limit it is uncertain when the fcc will rule on these issues 

pricing and packaging  the communications act and the fcc’s regulations and policies limit the prices that cable systems may charge for limited basic service equipment and installation as well as the manner in which cable operators may package premium or payperview services with other tiers of service these rules do not apply to cable systems that are determined by the fcc to be subject to “effective competition” but these determinations have thus far been made for only a small number of our cable systems failure to comply with these rate rules can result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals requiring cable operators to offer programming services on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to our current packaged offerings it is unclear whether or when congress the fcc or any other regulatory agency may adopt any new requirements with respect to the pricing or packaging of video services and how such requirements if adopted would affect our cable and programming businesses additionally communications act uniform pricing requirements may affect our ability to respond to increased competition through offers promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost 

mustcarryretransmission consent cable operators are currently required to carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial television stations “mustcarry” alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for “retransmission consent” which may enable popular stations to demand cash payments or other significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks affiliated with the broadcaster as a condition of transmitting the tv broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive as part of the transition from analog to digital broadcast transmission now scheduled for completion in february 2009 congress and the fcc gave each local broadcast station a digital channel capable of carrying multiple programming streams in addition to its current analog channel the fcc has to date rejected proposals to require cable operators to i simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each broadcaster during the transition cable operators currently are obligated to carry only the broadcaster’s analog signal during the transition and ii carry the multiple program streams transmitted within a broadcaster’s digital signal cable operators currently are obligated to carry only the primary digital video stream of the broadcaster after the broadcaster surrenders its analog channel however such proposals may continue to be presented by the fcc in general if such expanded carriage requirements were adopted we would have less freedom and capacity to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to our subscribers 

program accesslicensee agreements the communications act and the fcc’s “program access” rules generally prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing mvpds such as dbs and limit the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2007 and is expected to launch a proceeding to consider a further extension of the exclusivity restrictions in the first half of 2007 there is also increased attention at the fcc and in congress focused on exclusive arrangements involving sports programming in addition the communications act and the fcc’s “program carriage” rules prohibit cable operators or other mvpds from requiring a financial interest in any video programming network as a condition of carriage or from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its nonaffiliation in the selection terms or conditions for carriage the fcc is planning to launch a rulemaking aimed at streamlining the complaint processes for program 

  

access and program carriage complaints any decision by the fcc or congress to apply new program access or program carriage regulations to cable operators could have an adverse impact on our businesses additionally the fcc’s adelphia order discussed below expands the application of the program access rules to comcastaffiliated regional sports networks “rsns” and establishes an arbitration option for disputes over carriage of unaffiliated rsns 

cable equipment issues the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail sale of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services currently most cable subscribers access these services using a leased settop box that integrates cable access security with other operating functions subscribers may also obtain digital video services through a separate piece of equipment known as a cablecard that connects to digital cable devices purchased at retail effective july 2007 cable operators must cease placing into service new settop boxes with integrated security at that time newly deployed leased settop boxes must use a separate piece of equipment typically a cablecard to provide access to digital video services a federal court upheld the ban on integrated settop box security in august 2006 leaving any subsequent relief to the fcc we and other companies subject to the ban are currently seeking fcc waivers to exempt some limited function settop boxes from the ban andor to extend the deadline to accommodate a newer security technology that can be downloaded to leased settop boxes as well as retail equipment our waiver request for limitedfunction settop boxes was denied by the fcc’s media bureau in january 2007 we have requested a review of that decision by the full fcc but there is no assurance that our request will be granted if the fcc does not extend the deadline and does not grant our waiver request we will be forced to incur added costs in purchasing cablecardenabled settop boxes and the associated cablecards 

in addition the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of “plugandplay” tv sets that can connect directly to the cable network and receive oneway analog and digital video services without the need for a settop box we believe that we are substantially in compliance with these oneway plugandplay requirements 

franchise matters cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act contains provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospects generally are favorable 

there has been considerable activity at the federal and state level regarding franchise requirements imposed on new entrants in december 2006 the fcc adopted new rules designed to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants in announcing this decision the fcc said that it would among other things limit the range of financial construction and other commitments that franchising authorities can request of new entrants require franchising authorities to act on franchise applications by certain new entrants such as ilecs within 90 days and preempt certain local “level playing field” franchising requirements however the fcc has not yet released the text of its order so the terms are not yet fully known we expect the order will be subject to a court challenge once it is released in addition congress and various state governments are considering measures that would lessen or eliminate franchising requirements for new entrants including ilecs several states have already enacted legislation to provide statewide franchising or to simplify local franchising requirements for new entrants thus relieving new entrants of many of the local franchising burdens faced by incumbent operators certain of these state statutes allow the incumbent cable operator to “opt into” the new state franchise where a competing state franchise has been issued for the incumbent’s franchise area however even in those states where the incumbent cable operator is allowed to opt into a state franchise the incumbent operator typically retains certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant’s state franchise we have significant operations in several of the states that have passed state franchising legislation and we anticipate that additional states will pass similar franchising legislation 

  

the fcc has also announced that it will initiate a followon rulemaking to consider whether to make similar changes for existing cable operators we could be materially disadvantaged if rules that provide less burdensome franchising requirements for new entrants but not existing operators are implemented furthermore congress may also consider proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for ilecs and other new entrants if enacted this legislation could materially disadvantage existing operators 

pole attachments the communications act requires phone companies and other utilities other than those owned by municipalities or cooperatives to provide cable systems with nondiscriminatory access to any pole or rightofway controlled by the utility the rates that utilities may charge for such access are regulated by the fcc or alternatively by states that certify to the fcc that they regulate such rates several states in which we have cable systems have certified that they regulate pole rates there is always the possibility that the fcc or a state could permit the increase of pole attachment rates paid by cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which various phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we will face significantly higher pole attachment costs as our phone business expands 

privacy regulation the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of subscribers’ personal information by cable operators and phone providers additional requirements may be imposed if and to the extent state or local authorities establish their own privacy standards in addition the fcc the federal trade commission and many states have adopted rules that limit the telemarketing practices of cable operators and other commercial entities 

copyright regulation in exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the possible modification or elimination of this copyright license is the subject of ongoing legislative and administrative review the elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming expenses further the copyright office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create including our cable businesses’ local advertising and local origination programming and our programming businesses’ original programs these licensing fees have been the source of litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 

pegleased access the communications act permits franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside the use of channels for public educational and governmental “peg” access programming many of our cable systems provide substantial channel capacity and financial support for peg programming the communications act also requires a cable system with 36 or more channels to make available a portion of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator to date we have generally not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access however the fcc’s adelphia order will now permit programmers seeking to obtain commercial leased access carriage on our systems to submit rate and terms disputes to commercial arbitration further the fcc has stated that a new rulemaking will be commenced in an effort to facilitate the use of commercial leased access by potential programmers new fcc rules that significantly alter the rates or terms for commercial leased access could have an adverse impact on our business 

highspeed internet services 

we provide highspeed internet service by means of our existing cable systems in 2002 the fcc ruled that this was an “interstate information service” not subject to federal telecommunications regulation or state or local utility regulation that ruling was affirmed by the supreme court in june 2005 however our highspeed 

  

internet service is nonetheless subject to certain regulatory obligations in august 2005 the fcc adopted rules requiring providers of highspeed internet access service including cable operators to comply with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” the fcc required that by may 2007 highspeed internet service providers must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity we expect that our highspeed internet services will comply with these new requirements in addition congress is considering proposals that would give the attorney general authority to require that internet service providers retain for substantial periods information regarding their customers we do not know the scope or length of the data retention requirements that may be adopted or how they will affect our operating costs or potential liabilities 

congress and the fcc are considering defining certain rights for users of highspeed internet services and to regulate or restrict certain types of commercial agreements between service providers and providers of internet content these proposals are generally referred to as “network neutrality” in august 2005 the fcc issued a nonbinding policy statement stating four principles to guide its policymaking regarding highspeed internet and other related services these principles state that consumers are entitled to i access the lawful internet content of their choice ii run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement iii connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and iv enjoy competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers parties are pressing the fcc to adopt these principles as formal rules congress is considering legislation that would both codify these principles and impose additional obligations on highspeed internet providers and some states are considering similar proposals any new federal or state rules or statutes could limit our ability to manage our cable systems including use for other services to obtain value for use of our cable systems or to respond to competitive conditions we cannot predict whether such rules or statutes will be adopted 

a federal program generally applicable to telecommunications services known as the “universal service” program requires telecommunications service providers to collect and pay a fee based on their revenues in recent years roughly 10 of revenues into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in highcost areas and internet access and telecommunications services to schools and libraries and certain health care providers the fcc and congress are considering revisions to the universal service program that could result in highspeed internet access services being subject to universal service fees we cannot predict whether or how the universal service funding system might be extended to cover highspeed internet access services or if that occurs how it will affect us furthermore congress the fcc and certain local governments are also considering proposals to impose customer service quality of service and privacy standards on highspeed internet service providers and it is uncertain whether any of these proposals will be adopted 

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email further state and local governments have also adopted internetrelated regulations governmental bodies at all levels are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas such as pricing service and product quality and intellectual property ownership the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws including tax laws to the internet could have a material effect on our highspeed internet service 

phone services 

we offer phone service using both voip and circuitswitched technology the fcc has adopted a number of orders addressing specific regulatory issues relating to voip in november 2004 the fcc ruled that a particular form of voip service is not subject to state or local utility regulation state regulators and others have challenged that ruling including specifically its application to cabledelivered voip services such as comcast digital voice and at least one state public utility commission has claimed authority to regulate that service under state law in may 2005 the fcc adopted rules requiring voip service providers having certain characteristics including our comcast digital voice service to furnish enhanced 911 “e911” capabilities as a standard feature of their 

  

services and to advise their customers of the circumstances under which e911 service may not be available we believe comcast digital voice service complies with these requirements also in an order issued in september 2005 the fcc imposed calea obligations on voip service providers we expect that comcast digital voice will comply with these calea rules when they go into effect in may 2007 in june 2006 the fcc ruled that certain voip services including our comcast digital voice service would be subject to universal service payment obligations with respect to the interstate portions of the service congress is also considering legislation that if enacted would affect the regulatory obligations of voip service providers we cannot predict whether congress will approve such legislation 

the fcc has initiated other rulemakings to consider whether to impose further regulations on voip for example in one rulemaking it is considering whether and how certain types of common carrier regulations should apply to voip services including intercarrier compensation and the obligation to provide persons with disabilities with access to these services 

the fcc and congress are also considering how voip service should interconnect with ilecs’ phone networks since the fcc has never determined whether voip service is a “telecommunications service” the precise scope of ilec interconnection rules applicable to voip providers is not entirely clear as a result some ilecs may resist interconnecting directly with voip providers in light of these concerns voip service providers typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to ilec networks by contracting with an existing clec whose right to deal with the ilecs is clear we have arranged for such interconnection rights through our own and through thirdparty clecs it is uncertain whether and when the fcc or congress will adopt further rules in this area and how such rules would affect our comcast digital voice service 

our circuit  switched phone services are subject to federal state and local utility regulation although the level of regulation imposed on us is generally less than that applied to the incumbent phone companies the scope of ilec obligations is however being reevaluated at the fcc and in congress the fcc has already adopted measures relieving the ilecs of certain obligations to make elements of their networks available to competitors at costbased rates the fcc has also initiated rulemakings on intercarrier compensation universal service and other matters that in the aggregate could significantly change the rules that apply to phone competition including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers long  distance and local providers and incumbents and new entrants it is unclear how these proceedings will affect our phone services 

other areas 

the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable business and limited aspects of our programming business including the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming customer service standards political advertising indecent or obscene programming emergency alert system requirements for analog and digital services closed captioning requirements for the hearing impaired competitors’ access to cable wiring inside apartment buildings and other mdus commercial restrictions on children’s programming origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator sponsorship identification equal employment opportunity lottery programming program carriage recordkeeping and public file access requirements and technical standards relating to operation of the cable network we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and programming businesses 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities are considering imposing new taxes including sales and property taxes on the services we offer we cannot predict at this time whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report on form 10k we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “predicts” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that those statements are only our predictions in evaluating those statements you should specifically consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in “ risk factors” under item 1a and in other reports we file with the sec actual events or our actual results may differ materially from any of our forwardlooking statements 

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations because of changes in such factors other factors and risks could adversely affect our operations business or financial results of our businesses in the future and could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1a risk factors tableend all of the services offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers we compete directly with other programming distributors including dbs companies phone companies companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve and companies that offer programming and other communications services to our subscribers and potential subscribers including highspeed internet and voipenabled phone this competition may adversely affect our business and operations materially in the future 

programming expenses are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

we expect our programming expenses to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future in recent years the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of programming if we are unable to raise our subscribers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our operating results in addition as we add programming to our video services we may face increased programming expenses that in conjunction with the additional pricing constraints may reduce operating margins 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers we cannot predict the impact of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we fail to obtain the required consents 

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose costs and restrictions 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the cable industry and the circuitswitched phone services industry and may begin regulating the internet services industry we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases change the rights and obligations of cable operators and other entities under the communications act and other laws possibly in ways that we have not foreseen congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year and significant legislation to update the communications act is currently pending in congress the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal or transfer and such concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in the future in addition we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if local phone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us for example the fcc has adopted rules and several states have enacted legislation to ease the franchising process and reduce franchising burdens for new entrants congress and the fcc are also considering various forms of “network neutrality” regulation see “legislation and regulation—video services—franchise matters and highspeed internet services” in item 1 to this annual report on form 10k 

we may face increased competition because of technological advances and new regulatory requirements which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

ilecs are building wireline fiberoptic networks and in some case using internet protocol technology to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and have begun to offer this service in several states in addition to marketing dbs service in certain areas ilecs and other companies also offer dsl service which provides internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional analog modems we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in 

  

the marketplace to occur in the future new technologies and services may develop that compete with services that cable systems offer and such services may not be regulated in the same manner or to the same extent as our services the success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business operations moreover in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters 

we are involved in various litigation matters including those arising in the ordinary course of business and those described under the caption “legal proceedings “ in item 3 of this annual report on form 10k while we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations for any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we have made acquisitions and have entered into other strategic transactions in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions these factors could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over a number of potentially material transactions and through his beneficial ownership of the class b common stock our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations 

our class b common stock has a nondilutable 33 1 3  of the combined voting power of our common stock this nondilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9444375 which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business subject to adjustment in specified situations stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a special common stock do not decrease the nondilutable voting power of the class b common stock the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over the following potentially material transactions mergers or consolidations involving comcast corporation transactions such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10 of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock and amendments to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock brian l roberts beneficially owns of all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and accordingly has considerable influence over our operations and has the ability to transfer potential effective control by selling the class b common stock in addition under our articles of incorporation mr roberts is entitled to remain as our chairman chief executive officer and president until may 26 2010 unless he is removed by the affirmative vote of at least 75 of the entire board of directors or he is no longer willing or able to serve

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend at home cases 

litigation has been filed against us as a result of our alleged conduct with respect to our investment in and distribution relationship with at home corporation at home was a provider of highspeed internet services that filed for bankruptcy protection in september 2001 filed actions are i class action lawsuits against us att the former controlling shareholder of at home and also a former distributor of the at home service and others in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging securities law violations and common law fraud in connection with disclosures made by at home in 2001 and ii a lawsuit brought in the united states district court for the district of delaware in the name of at home by certain at home 

  

bondholders against us brian l roberts our chairman and chief executive officer and a director cox cox is also an investor in at home and a former distributor of the at home service and others alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to march 2000 agreements which among other things revised the distributor relationships and seeking recovery of alleged shortswing profits pursuant to section 16b of the exchange act purported to have arisen in connection with certain transactions relating to at home stock effected pursuant to the march 2000 agreements 

in the southern district of new york actions item i above the court dismissed all claims the plaintiffs’ appealed this decision and the court of appeals for the second circuit denied the plaintiffs’ appeal the plaintiffs petitioned the court of appeals for rehearing the delaware case item ii above was transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the court dismissed the section 16b claims and the breach of fiduciary duty claim for lack of federal jurisdiction the court of appeals for the second circuit denied the plaintiffs’ appeal from the decision dismissing the section 16b claims and the us supreme court denied the plaintiffs’ petition for a further appeal the plaintiffs recommenced the breach of fiduciary duty claim in delaware chancery court the court has set a trial date in october 2007 

under the terms of our 2002 acquisition of att corp’s cable business we are contractually liable for 50 of any liabilities of att in the actions described in items i and ii above in which we are also a defendant 

we deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against us our subsidiaries and brian l roberts and are defending all of these claims vigorously the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material adverse to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

att—tci cases 

in june 1998 class action lawsuits were filed by thenshareholders of telecommunications inc “tci” series a tci group common stock “common a” against att and the directors of tci relating to the acquisition of tci by att alleging that former members of the tci board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to common a shareholders by agreeing to transaction terms whereby holders of the series b tci group common stock received a 10 premium over what common a shareholders received 

in connection with the tci acquisition completed in early 1999 att agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify tci’s former directors for certain liabilities potentially including those incurred in connection with this action under the terms of our acquisition of att corp’s cable business i we agreed to indemnify att for certain liabilities potentially including those incurred by att in connection with this action and ii we assumed certain obligations of tci to indemnify its former directors potentially including those incurred in connection with this action 

in october 2006 these lawsuits were settled we agreed to contribute approximately 44 million to the settlement this amount was paid in november 2006 and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 the settlement was approved in february 2007 

patent litigation 

we are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses in certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants and also in certain of these cases we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions to the extent that the allegations in these lawsuits can be analyzed by us at this stage of their proceedings we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously the final disposition of these claims is not expected to 

  

have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

antitrust cases 

we are defendants in two purported class actions originally filed in the united states district courts for the district of massachusetts and the eastern district of pennsylvania respectively the potential class in the massachusetts case is our subscriber base in the “boston cluster” area and the potential class in the pennsylvania case is our subscriber base in the “philadelphia and chicago clusters” as those terms are defined in the complaints in each case the plaintiffs allege that certain subscriber exchange transactions with other cable providers resulted in unlawful “horizontal market restraints” in those areas and seek damages pursuant to antitrust statutes including treble damages 

as a result of recent events in both cases relating to the procedural issue of whether the plaintiffs’ claims could proceed in court or alternatively whether the plaintiffs should be compelled to arbitrate their claims pursuant to arbitration clauses in their subscriber agreements it has become more likely that these cases will proceed in court our motion to dismiss the pennsylvania case on the pleadings was denied and the plaintiffs have moved to certify a class action we are opposing the plaintiffs’ motion and are proceeding with class discovery we have moved to dismiss the massachusetts case the massachusetts case was recently transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania and plaintiffs are seeking to consolidate it with the pennsylvania case 

we believe the claims in these actions are without merit and are defending the actions vigorously the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

other 

we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity

in some areas we offer our circuitswitched local phone service substantially all this business was obtained in the broadband acquisition subscribers to this service have access to a full array of calling features and thirdparty longdistance services 

  

advertising 

  

as part of our programming license agreements with cable networks we often receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time which we may sell to local regional and national advertisers 

  

we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets we have also formed and operate or participate in advertising interconnects which establish a physical direct link among multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator 

  

regional sports and news networks 

  

our regional sports and news networks include comcast sportsnet philadelphia comcast sportsnet midatlantic baltimorewashington cable sports southeast cn8—the comcast network comcast sportsnet chicago and comcast sportsnet west sacramento these networks earn revenue through the sale of advertising time and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators and satellite television companies 

  

other revenue sources 

  

we also generate revenues from installation services commissions from thirdparty electronic retailing and from other services such as providing businesses with internet connectivity and networked business applications 

  

programming 

  

we license from cable networks the programming we offer to our video subscribers generally on a multiyear basis and for which we generally pay a monthly fee on a per video subscriber per channel basis we attempt to secure longterm licenses with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives 

  

our programming costs are increased by the growth in the number of video subscribers the increase in the number of channels we provide and increases in license fees we expect our programming costs to continue to be our largest single expense item and to increase in the future in recent years the cable and satellite television industries have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of programming particularly sports programming we anticipate that these increases may be mitigated to some extent by volume discounts 

  

customer and technical service 

  

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers generally our call centers provide 247 call answering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services function 

  

performs various tasks including installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

  

technology development 

  

historically we have relied on thirdparty hardware and software vendors for many of the technologies needed for the operation of our businesses the addition of new features to existing services and the development and commercialization of new service offerings in recent years we have begun developing strategically important software and technologies internally and integrating thirdparty software to our specifications we have also now arranged for longterm access rights to national fiberbased networks that we actively manage to interconnect our local and regional distribution systems and facilitate the efficient delivery of our broadband services we expect these efforts to continue and expand in the future these efforts require greater initial expenditures than would be required if we continued to purchase or license these products and services from third parties 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales efforts are primarily directed toward generating incremental revenues and increasing the number of subscribers we serve we offer our products and services through direct customer contact through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising cable television advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets 

  

competition 

  

we operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive environment our broadband cable systems compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment and new technologies may further increase the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and advertising we expect advances in communications technology to continue in the future we are unable to predict what effects if any such future developments will have on our businesses and operations 

  

video services 

  

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc adopted rules favoring new investment by ilecs in fiberoptic networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video service offerings furthermore congress the fcc and various state governments are considering measures that would reduce or eliminate local franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including the ilecs the state of texas has enacted legislation to provide a statewide franchise to new entrants thus eliminating the requirement that such entrants obtain franchises from individual local franchising authorities in order to compete effectively we strive to provide at a reasonable price to subscribers new products and services superior technical performance and customer service and a greater variety of video programming 

  

dbs systems  according to recent government and industry reports conventional medium and highpower satellites currently provide video programming to over 27 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer more than 300 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and echostar provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

  

highpower dbs service can be received throughout the continental united states through small rooftop or sidemounted outside antennas dbs systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals delivered to subscribers by dbs systems 

  

federal legislation establishes among other things a compulsory copyright license that permits dbs systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who reside in the local television station’s market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we serve additionally federal law generally provides dbs systems with access to all cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite as a result dbs providers are competitive with cable system operators like us because they offer programming that closely resembles what we offer these dbs providers are attempting to expand their service offerings to include among other things highspeed internet service and have entered into marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by ilecs 

  

ilecs  ilecs in particular att and verizon are building fiberoptic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and have begun to offer this service in limited areas in addition to entering into joint marketing arrangements with dbs providers in certain areas the ilecs have taken various positions on the question of whether they need a local cable television franchise to provide video services including applying for local franchises seeking statelevel regulation only and claiming that video services can be provided without a cable television franchise 

  

other wireline providers  we operate our cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises that are issued by a local community governing body such as a city council or county board of supervisors or in some 

  

cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems various companies including those that traditionally have not provided cable services and have substantial financial resources such as public utilities including those that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached have obtained cable franchises and provide competing communications services these and other wireline communications systems offer video and other communications services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

  

smatv  our cable systems also compete for subscribers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation like local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and many of the cable networks offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv operators are offering packages of phone data and video services to residential and commercial developments smatv system operators often enter into exclusive service agreements with building owners or homeowners’ associations although some states have enacted laws to provide cable systems access to mdus 

  

broadcast subscription services  local television broadcasters in selected markets sell digital subscription services these services typically contain a limited number of cable programming services at a price of approximately 20 per month several leading television broadcast station ownership groups have announced that they are providing funding for us digital television inc an entity that currently offers these digital subscription services in several markets as a low cost alternative to cable television service many other broadcasters are considering similar plans 

  

highspeed internet services 

  

substantially all of our cable systems offer highspeed internet service within their service areas these systems compete with a number of other companies many of whom have substantial resources including 

  

   

   

   

   

the deployment of digital subscriber line “dsl” technology allows internet access to be provided to subscribers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional modems the ilecs and other companies offer dsl service and several of them have increased transmission speeds lowered prices or created bundled service packages in addition some ilecs are constructing fiberoptic networks that allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with dsl technology the fcc has reduced the obligations of ilecs to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale or retail basis to competitors and it has freed their dsl services of common carrier regulation 

  

various wireless telephone companies are offering wireless highspeed internet services in addition in a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports wireless “wifi” internet access capability is available numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publiclysubsidized wifi internet access networks the availability of these alternatives may adversely affect demand for our highspeed internet services 

  

a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we reached access agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps although to date these isps have made limited use of their rights we cannot provide any assurance however that regulatory authorities will not impose socalled “open access” or similar 

  

requirements on us as part of an industrywide requirement these requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we expect competition for highspeed internet service subscribers to remain intense with companies competing on service availability price transmission speed and bundled services 

  

phone services 

  

our circuitswitched local phone service and comcast digital voice service compete against ilecs wireless telephone service providers competitive local exchange carriers “clecs” and other voiceoverip “voip” service providers the ilecs have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few clecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

  

we anticipate that by the end of 2006 approximately 27 million homes will access to comcast digital voice we expect to migrate our circuitswitched phone customers to our comcast digital voice service over the next several years the competitive nature of the telephone business may negatively affect demand for and pricing of our phone services 

  

advertising 

  

our cable systems compete against a wide variety of media for sales of advertising including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national and regional cable television networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and the internet continuing competition from these media outlets and the continued expansion of new media outlets offering advertising opportunities may result in a dilution of the portion of advertising expenditures our cable systems currently receive 

  

content segment 

  

the table below presents information as of december 31 2005 relating to our six national cable networks 

  

   

revenue for our networks are principally generated from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by cable system operators and satellite television companies that have typically entered into multiyear contracts to distribute our networks to obtain longterm contracts with distributors we may make cash payments provide an initial period in which license fee payments are waived or do both license fee revenues are reported net of the cost of incentives granted in exchange for multiyear license contracts our networks and their distributors engage in ongoing marketing and promotional activities to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers although we believe prospects of continued carriage and marketing of our networks by their larger distributors are generally good the loss of one or more of them as distributors could have a material adverse effect on the affected network 

  

competition 

  

our networks compete with other television programming services for distribution and programming in addition our networks compete with all other forms of programming provided to viewers including broadcast networks local broadcast stations pay and other cable networks home video payperview and vod services and online activities for viewers’ attention and audience share finally our networks compete with other national and local media including other television networks television stations radio stations newspapers internet sites and direct mail for advertising revenues 

  

other businesses 

  

in addition to comcast spectacor we also own noncontrolling interests in various programming entities including in demand tv one mgm pbs kids sprout sportschannel new england new england cable news pittsburgh cable news channel music choice and sterling entertainment 

  

legislation and regulation 

  

our video and phone services are subject to numerous requirements prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws and regulations local ordinances and our franchise agreements our highspeed internet service while not currently subject to significant regulation may be subject to such regulation in the future our content businesses are with limited exceptions not subject to direct governmental regulation laws and regulations affect the prices we can charge for some services such as limited basic cable service and associated customerpremises equipment the costs we incur for example for attaching our wires to poles owned by utility companies the relationships we establish with our suppliers subscribers and competitors and many other aspects of our businesses 

  

the most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the communications act of 1934 as amended the provisions of the communications act and the manner in which the fcc state and local authorities and the courts implement and interpret those provisions affect our ability to develop and execute business plans our ability to raise capital and the competitive dynamics between and among different sectors of the communications and entertainment industries in which we operate the fcc also has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders and the imposition of other administrative sanctions such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate some of the transmission facilities we use in connection with our cable business 

  

we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by or under the communications act but we caution that the precise requirements of the law are not always clear moreover many laws and regulations can be interpreted in afterthefact enforcement proceedings or privateparty litigation in a manner that is inconsistent with the judgments we have made we also note that regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing rules or prescribe new ones judicial decisions often alter the regulatory framework in ways that are inconsistent with regulator business and investor expectations in addition our businesses can be significantly affected by the enactment of new legislation congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year and a significant initiative to update the communications act began in 2005 and is expected to continue in 2006 we always face the risk that congress or one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our businesses in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we are subject to new laws or regulations that do not equally affect our satellite wireline and wireless competitors or if our competitors are relieved of legal obligations that continue to apply to us or that currently apply only to them 

  

a major objective of congress and the fcc has been to increase competition in all communications services including those central to our business for example congress has removed barriers to ilecs offering 

  

video services in their local service areas and the fcc has taken additional steps that are encouraging ilecs to expand their investment in fiberoptic networks which makes it easier for those companies to deliver video highspeed internet and other services the fcc has also assigned spectrum licenses for mvdds a wireless service providing multichannel video programming in addition the fcc is continuing to adopt measures to increase the capacity for satellitedelivered services and has largely cleared the way for electric utilities to use their power lines to provide video and highspeed internet services our businesses could be affected by additional competitors that enter the video or highspeed internet businesses as a result of these and similar efforts by congress or the fcc in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to these new competitors such as if ilecs that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us for example the state of texas enacted legislation in 2005 providing statewide franchises for new video service providers on terms less burdensome than our existing local franchise requirements other states where we have significant operations are considering similar legislation 

  

the following paragraphs describe existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements that are the most significant to our businesses today 

  

time warner divestiture 

  

the fcc approved the broadband acquisition in november 2002 subject to various conditions the most significant were a requirement for the divestiture of our interests in time warner and its cable affiliates by november 2007 subject to a sixmonth extension a requirement that the interests be placed in trust pending divestiture and safeguards that limit our involvement in time warner cable’s programmingrelated activities pending divestiture complying with these conditions has limited and will continue to limit our flexibility as to the timing and nature of a sale or other disposition of the interests and in the interim may constrain our business dealings with time warner we have fully complied with these conditions and are committed to meeting our obligations under the fcc’s order 

  

adelphia acquisition 

  

we have filed a joint application with time warner and adelphia seeking the fcc’s approval of the acquisition of the adelphia cable systems the proposed adelphia transactions also would accomplish the divestiture of our part of the time warner cable interests as required by the fcc the fcc is expected to make its decision by the end of the first half of 2006 we cannot predict whether the fcc will approve the application or whether if it does approve the application it will do so subject to unfavorable conditions 

  

ownership limits 

  

the fcc is considering imposing “horizontal ownership limits” that would limit the percentage of multichannel video subscribers that any single cable provider could serve nationwide a federal appellate court struck down the previous 30 limit and the fcc is now considering this issue anew we serve approximately 28 of multichannel video subscribers and will still be under the previous 30 limit after the completion of pending acquisitions if the fcc were to reinstate ownership limits similar to those previously imposed such limits would restrict our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate “vertical ownership limits” on the number of affiliated programming services a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels was also invalidated by the federal appellate court new vertical limits could affect our content business in addition the fcc is considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules that would affect which cable subscribers are counted under any horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted for purposes of any vertical ownership limit it is uncertain when the fcc will rule on these issues 

  

pricing and packaging 

  

the communications act and the fcc’s regulations and policies limit the prices that cable systems may charge for limited basic service equipment and installation these rules do not apply to cable systems that are determined by the fcc to be “subject to effective competition” but these determinations have thus far been made for only a small number of our cable systems failure to comply with these rate rules could result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers from time to time congress and the fcc consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals to require cable operators to offer programming services on an a la carte or themedtier basis instead of or in addition to the current packaged offerings our video service offerings currently include various service tiers with availability varying depending on level of service demographics and other factors such as sports hispanic and our recently announced family tier we cannot now predict whether or when congress the fcc or any other regulatory agency may adopt any new requirements with respect to the pricing or packaging of video services and how such requirements if adopted would affect our cable and content businesses also various competitors are trying to persuade the fcc and the justice department to limit our ability to respond to increased competition through offers promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost we believe our competitive pricing practices are lawful and procompetitive if we cannot make individualized offers to subscribers who would otherwise choose a different provider our subscriber attrition may increase or our overall prices may need to be reduced or both 

  

mustcarryretransmission consent 

  

cable companies are currently subject to a requirement that they carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most commercial and noncommercial local television stations “mustcarry” alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for “retransmission consent” which may enable popular stations to demand significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks as a condition of our ability to transmit the tv broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive as part of the transition from analog to digital broadcast transmission congress and the fcc gave each local broadcast station a digital channel capable of carrying multiple programming streams in addition to its current analog channel in february 2005 the fcc voted to reject proposals to require cable companies to 1 simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each broadcaster during the transition cable companies must only carry the broadcaster’s analog signal during the transition or if the broadcaster has already returned its analog channel the broadcaster’s digital signal and 2 carry the multiple program streams that can be transmitted in a broadcaster’s digital signal cable companies must only carry the primary digital video stream of the broadcaster after the broadcaster has returned its analog channel although the fcc has thus far ruled against such expanded mustcarry requirements we cannot predict whether such requirements may result from additional fcc proceedings judicial proceedings or legislation in general if such expanded carriage requirements were adopted we would have less freedom to allocate the usable spectrum of our cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to our subscribers this could diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers particularly if such requirements are not imposed on our competitors 

  

program access 

  

the communications act and the fcc’s “program access” rules generally prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video distributors such as dbs and limit the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2007 the fcc has concluded that the program access rules generally do not apply to programming services such as comcast sportsnet philadelphia that are delivered terrestrially however the fcc has indicated that it may reconsider how it regulates cable operators with regional sports programming interests and there has been some congressional interest in extending the exclusivity prohibition to terrestriallydelivered programming any 

  

decision by the fcc or congress to apply new program access or program carriage regulations to cable operators could have an adverse impact on our businesses 

  

cable equipment issues 

  

the fcc has adopted regulations aimed at promoting the retail availability of settop boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital cable services currently most cable customers access such services using a leased settop box that integrates cable access security with other operating functions effective july 2007 cable operators must cease placing into service settop boxes with integrated security at that time newly deployed leased settop boxes and devices purchased at retail must rely on a separate piece of equipment known as a cablecard to provide access to digital cable services we have urged elimination of the ban on integrated settop boxes on the grounds that it unfairly singles out cable operators for regulation the ban does not apply to dbs limits consumer choice increases the cost of settop box equipment and slows the deployment of digital cable services thus far the fcc has rejected these arguments indicating in a march 2005 decision that it would not revisit the issue of whether to eliminate the ban on integrated settop boxes certain cable companies have challenged the fcc’s decision in federal court it is uncertain how the court will rule on this appeal the fcc also indicated in its march 2005 decision that it might consider further deferrals of the july 2007 ban on integrated settop boxes to the extent the cable industry makes adequate progress on softwarebased security solutions that can be downloaded to leased settop boxes as well as retail equipment if the fcc does not extend the deadline again and does not waive the rules for lowcost limitedfunction settop boxes we will be forced to incur added costs in purchasing cablecardenabled settop boxes and the associated cablecards 

  

in addition the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of “plugandplay” tv sets that can connect directly to the cable network and receive oneway analog and digital cable services without the need for a settop box we believe that we are substantially in compliance with these oneway plugandplay requirements also the cable consumer electronics and other industries are currently negotiating an agreement for twoway interactive plugandplay equipment the pace of these negotiations is affected by a host of complex technical engineering business copy protection licensing and other issues some in congress and at the fcc are urging that the parties complete the negotiations by a specific date or risk having the government impose deadlines on the parties or adopt rules even in the absence of an industry agreement it is unclear how this process will unfold and how it will ultimately affect our cable business and our efforts to sell cable services at retail outlets 

  

franchise matters 

  

cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction these franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act includes provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we anticipate that our future franchise renewal prospects generally will be favorable 

  

congress the fcc and various state governments are considering measures that would lessen or eliminate franchising requirements for new entrants into the multichannel video marketplace including the ilecs the state of texas for example has enacted legislation to provide a statewide franchise to new entrants thus relieving them of the obligation to seek franchises in individual local service areas that law is now being challenged in court but it is uncertain how the court will rule on the matter other states are now considering similar legislation likewise congress and the fcc are considering proposals to eliminate or streamline local franchising requirements for the ilecs and other new entrants congress is reviewing proposals to replace the local franchising process with a national process which if enacted could benefit the ilecs in addition the fcc has launched a rulemaking intended to ease the franchising process for new entrants we could be 

  

materially disadvantaged if proposals to change franchising rules for our competitors but not for cable operators are approved 

  

pegleased access 

  

the communications act permits franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside the use of channels for public educational and governmental peg access programming we provide substantial channel capacity and financial support for peg programming the communications act also requires a cable system with 36 or more channels to make available a portion of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator to date we have generally not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access 

  

state and local taxes 

  

some states and localities are considering imposing new taxes including sales taxes on the services we offer we cannot predict at this time whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business 

  

highspeed internet service 

  

historically the ilecs have been required to share their highspeed internet facilities most commonly dsl with unaffiliated thirdparty isps while cable companies generally faced no similar regulatory requirement for their cable highspeed internet service some local governments and various competitors had advocated the imposition of regulatory requirements on how cable operators deal with thirdparty isps only a few local governments actually imposed such requirements and in each case the courts have invalidated them in 2002 the fcc formally classified cable highspeed internet service as an “interstate information service” rather than a “telecommunications service” such classification meant that traditional telecommunications regulations would not apply to cable highspeed internet service that fcc decision was appealed and in june 2005 the us supreme court upheld the fcc’s classification of cable highspeed internet service as an interstate information service in response to the supreme court’s decision the fcc adopted rules in august 2005 according similar deregulatory treatment to the highspeed internet offerings of the ilecs under the fcc’s ruling the ilecs will no longer be required to share their highspeed internet facilities with thirdparty isps after a oneyear phaseout period it is uncertain what impact the fcc’s ruling will have on the competitive position of our cable highspeed internet business 

  

congress and the fcc are considering proposals to establish the rights of end users of highspeed internet services and regulate or restrict commercial agreements between providers of highspeed internet services and content providers these proposals come under the collective name of “network neutrality” the fcc issued a nonbinding policy statement in august 2005 establishing four basic principles to guide its ongoing policymaking activities regarding highspeed internet and other broadbandrelated services those principles state that 1 consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice 2 consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice subject to the needs of law enforcement 3 consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network and 4 consumers are entitled to competition among network providers application and service providers and content providers the fcc required verizon and att to abide by these principles for a twoyear period as a condition to the verizonmci and attsbc mergers congress is also considering legislation to codify these or related principles subject to various conditions any such rules or statutes could limit the ability of highspeed internet providers to manage their networks including their use for other services to obtain value for use of their networks or to respond to competitive conditions we cannot predict whether such rules or statutes will be approved 

  

the fcc has also imposed certain regulatory requirements on providers of highspeed internet service in august 2005 the fcc adopted rules generally requiring such providers including cable operators to comply 

  

with the communications assistance for law enforcement act “calea” under these new rules highspeed internet service providers must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity the rules are scheduled to go into effect in 2007 but are now subject to court challenge we anticipate that our highspeed internet services will comply with these new requirements 

  

congress and the fcc are considering additional proposals regarding the regulation of highspeed internet services for example congress is considering legislative proposals that would require highspeed internet service providers to register with the fcc and comply with various rules including customer privacy consumer service standards and access for persons with disabilities likewise the fcc has initiated rulemakings on whether it should develop a framework for consumer protection requirements for all providers of highspeed internet services regardless of the underlying technology and also whether local and state authorities should be permitted to do so it is uncertain what if any laws or regulations congress or the fcc might ultimately impose on cable highspeed internet or competing services in addition certain local governments are pursuing regulation of highspeed internet services for example one local franchise authority has already imposed customer service requirements and made them a condition of our cable franchise agreement and other local governments may attempt to do so also a few franchising authorities have sued us seeking payment of franchise fees on highspeed internet service revenues 

  

internet regulation 

  

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email further state and local governmental organizations have also adopted internetrelated regulations these various governmental bodies are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas such as pricing service and product quality and intellectual property ownership the adoption of new laws or the adaptation of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet service 

  

phone service 

  

our circuit  switched phone services are subject to federal state and local regulation in general the communications act imposes interconnection requirements and universal service contribution obligations on all telecommunications service providers including those that provide circuit  switched phone services over cable facilities and more significant regulations on ilecs these common carrier rules however are being reevaluated at the fcc and in congress the fcc has already adopted measures relieving the ilecs of certain obligations to make elements of their networks available to competitors at costbased rates the fcc has also initiated rulemakings on intercarrier compensation universal service and other matters that in the aggregate could significantly change the rules that apply to telephone competition including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers long  distance and local providers and incumbents and new entrants it is unclear how those proceedings and the litigation and implementation proceedings that are already underway as a product of one of these rulemaking proceedings will affect our circuitswitched phone services 

  

the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider whether and how to regulate voip and other ip  enabled services among other things the fcc will determine whether and how certain types of common carrier regulations should apply to voip services including intercarrier compensation universal service and the obligation to provide persons with disabilities with access to these services the fcc has already adopted a number of orders addressing specific regulatory issues relating to voip in may 2005 for example the fcc adopted rules requiring voip service providers having certain characteristics to furnish enhanced 911 “e911” capabilities as a standard feature of their services additionally voip service providers must advise their customers of the circumstances under which e911 service may not be available and comply with other e911related requirements specified by the fcc we believe comcast digital voice service complies with these new 

  

requirements likewise in august 2005 the fcc imposed calearelated requirements on voip service providers we anticipate that comcast digital voice will comply with the new calea rules when they go into effect in 2007 congress is also considering legislation that if enacted would impact the regulatory obligations of voip service providers we cannot predict whether congress will approve such legislation 

  

the fcc and congress are also considering measures relating to how voip service interconnects with the phone networks of the ilecs in the circuitswitched environment ilecs have a clear obligation to negotiate interconnection agreements with clecs however it is uncertain what interconnection obligations the ilecs have with respect to voip service providers that do not obtain clec status the fcc has yet to classify voip service for regulatory purposes while classification of voip as an information service would be beneficial to voip providers including comcast digital voice since legacy telecommunications service regulations presumably would not apply such classification might lead ilecs to resist interconnecting directly with voip providers in light of these concerns voip service providers typically either secure clec authorization or they obtain indirect interconnection to ilec networks by contracting with existing clecs whose right to deal with the ilecs is clear under the communications act and fcc regulations comcast has arranged for such interconnection rights through our own clecs the fcc is considering this issue in its rulemaking on ipenabled services and congress is considering the issue as well it is uncertain whether and when the fcc or congress will adopt further rules in this area and how such rules would affect our comcast digital voice service 

  

in addition several states have attempted to impose common carrier regulation on voip services however the fcc adopted an order in november 2004 declaring that one particular voip service is not subject to state public utility regulation further the fcc indicated that other types of voip services such as those offered by cable companies would not be subject to state public utility regulation if they require a broadband connection from the user’s location require the use of ipcompatible customer premises equipment and include a suite of integrated capabilities and features able to be invoked sequentially or simultaneously that allows customers to manage personal communications dynamically it is unclear how this ruling and other voip servicerelated proceedings at the federal and state levels and related judicial proceedings might affect our comcast digital voice service 

  

other issues 

  

there are a number of other regulatory matters under review by congress the fcc and other federal agencies that could affect our cable and content businesses 

  

tier buy through the communications act generally requires cable operators to allow subscribers to purchase premium or payperview services without the necessity of subscribing to any tier of service other than the limited basic service tier the applicability of this rule in certain situations remains unclear and adverse decisions by the fcc on this issue could affect our pricing and packaging of services 

  

content regulation the communications act prohibits the transmission of obscene programming over cable systems additionally some parties have proposed that new laws or rules regulating indecent and violent programming be imposed on cable operators it is uncertain whether and when any such laws will be enacted or regulations will be adopted and if enacted or adopted what impact such laws or regulations would have on our cable and content businesses 

  

mdu access the fcc has adopted rules intended to make it easier for multichannel video service providers to compete with established cable operators in serving mdus 

  

pole attachments  the communications act requires that telephone companies and other utilities other than those owned by municipalities or cooperatives provide cable systems with nondiscriminatory access to any pole or rightofway controlled by the utility the rates that utilities may charge for such access are regulated by the fcc or alternatively by states that certify to the fcc that they regulate such rates several states in which we have cable systems have so certified there is always the possibility that the fcc or a state could increase 

  

the pole attachment rate paid by cable operators additionally higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fcc’s telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which various phone services are transmitted remain unclear and there is a risk that we will face higher costs as our phone business expands 

  

eas and closed captioning  the fcc has adopted rules requiring cable operators to deliver emergency alert system “eas” warnings via digital cable services rather than just analog services this change imposes new equipment costs on cable operators the fcc has also adopted rules imposing closed captioning requirements on cable operators broadcasters programmers and others advocates for the hearing impaired have urged the fcc to toughen its rules on closed captioning compliance and enforcement the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider these and other proposals if adopted such expanded closed captioning requirements would impose further regulatory burdens on cable operators and programmers the fcc has not indicated whether or when it will adopt such rules 

  

children’s television the fcc has adopted rules that among other things limit the amount of commercials which may be aired in certain children’s programming to 105 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and restrict the use of program characters or show hosts to sell products in commercials during or adjacent to children’s programming the fcc adopted additional rules in 2004 that would also restrict the display of internet website addresses in children’s programming those additional rules have been stayed pending further rulemaking and it is uncertain what rules the fcc will ultimately establish and how such rules will affect our cable and content businesses 

  

privacy regulation the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure of subscribers’ personal information by cable operators there are possible interpretations of the communications act that could severely limit the ability of service providers to collect and use personal information for commercial purposes congress is now considering legislation that would extend these and other privacy requirements to highspeed internet service and voip providers further constraints could also be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy standards in addition the fcc the federal trade commission and many states have adopted rules that limit the telemarketing practices of cable operators and other commercial entities 

  

copyright regulation in exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the us copyright office has recommended that congress revise this compulsory licensing scheme although congress has thus far declined to do so the elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs further the copyright office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we create including our cable businesses’ local advertising and local origination programming and our content businesses’ original programs these licensing fees have been the source of litigation with music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 

  

broadcast flag the fcc adopted rules in 2003 requiring cable operators to implement the “broadcast flag” a code that may be embedded in digital broadcast programming that directs digital tvs and other consumer electronics equipment to block the redistribution of such content over the internet these rules if implemented would have likely affected the design of cablerelated equipment and homenetworking technologies however in 2005 a federal appeals court invalidated the broadcast flag rules on the grounds that the fcc lacked jurisdiction under the communications act to promulgate them congress is considering proposals to reinstate the rules thus far those efforts have been unsuccessful but we cannot predict whether congress will eventually approve legislation to revive the broadcast flag rules and if adopted how such legislation would affect cable operators 

  

other areas the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable and content businesses including among other things 1 the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming 2 customer service standards 3 political advertising 4 origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the cable operator 5 sponsorship identification 6 equal employment opportunity 7 lottery programming 8 program carriage 9 recordkeeping and public file access requirements and 10 technical standards relating to operation of the cable network we are not aware that the fcc is considering any significant revisions to these rules at this time but we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable and content businesses 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 80000 employees including parttime employees of these employees approximately 62000 were associated with cable and approximately 18000 were associated with our other divisions approximately 4000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

  

caution concerning forwardlooking statements 

  

the sec encourages companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions in this annual report we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance in some cases you can identify these socalled “forwardlooking statements” by words such as “may” “will” “should” “expects” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “predicts” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words and other comparable words you should be aware that those statements are only our predictions in evaluating those statements you should specifically consider various factors including the risks and uncertainties listed in risk factors under item 1a and in other reports we file with the sec actual events or our actual results may differ materially from any of our forwardlooking statements 

  

additionally we operate in a highly competitive consumerdriven and rapidly changing environment the environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social conditions consumer response to new and existing products and services technological developments and particularly in view of new technologies the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights our actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations because of changes in such factors other factors and risks could adversely affect our operations business or financial results of our businesses in the future and could also cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the services offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

  

our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers we compete directly with other program distributors including satellite companies telephone companies companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve and companies that offer programming and other communications services to our subscribers and potential subscribers including highspeed internet and ipenabled phone this competition may adversely affect our business and operations materially in the future 

  

programming costs are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

  

we expect our programming costs to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future in recent years the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of 

  

programming if we are unable to raise our subscribers’ rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our operating results in addition as we add programming to our video services we may face increased programming costs that in conjunction with the additional pricing constraints may reduce operating margins 

  

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers we cannot predict the impact of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we fail to obtain the required consents 

  

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose costs and restrictions 

  

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the cable industry and the circuitswitched phone services industry and may begin regulating the internet services industry we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases change the rights and obligations of cable companies and other entities under the communications act and other laws possibly in ways that we have not foreseen congress considers new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year and a significant initiative to update the communications act began in 2005 and is expected to continue in 2006 the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal or transfer and such concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in the future in addition we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our competitors such as if local telephone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us 

  

we may face increased competition because of technological advances and new regulatory requirements which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

  

the ilecs are building wireline fiberoptic networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas and have begun to offer this service in limited areas in addition to marketing dbs service in certain areas in addition the ilecs and other companies offer dsl service which provides internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional analog modems we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future other new technologies and services may develop and may compete with services that cable systems offer the success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business operations moreover in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems 

  

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters including litigation associated with the broadband acquisition 

  

we are involved in various litigation matters including those arising in the ordinary course of business and those described under the caption “ legal proceedings ” in item 3 to this annual report on form 10k among these matters is litigation associated with the broadband acquisition and for which att controls the defense of the litigation while we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations for any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions and have entered into other strategic transactions for example in april 2005 we entered into agreements with time warner to jointly acquire substantially all the assets of adelphia in april 2005 we acquired a 20 interest in mgm in october 2005 we agreed to buy the cable systems of susquehanna communications and in november 2005 we entered into a joint venture with sprint time warner cable cox and advancenewhouse to develop products using wireless technology in connection with acquisitions and other strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees customers and vendors incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations 

  

brian l roberts has significant control over our operations through his beneficial ownership of all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock which have a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our common stock and separate approval rights over certain material transactions involving us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

at home cases 

  

litigation has been filed against us as a result of our alleged conduct with respect to our investment in and distribution relationship with at home corporation at home was a provider of highspeed internet services that filed for bankruptcy protection in september 2001 filed actions are i class action lawsuits against us brian l roberts our chairman and chief executive officer and a director att the former controlling shareholder of at home and also a former distributor of the at home service and others in the superior court of san mateo county california alleging breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with transactions agreed to in march 2000 among at home att cox cox is also an investor in at home and a former distributor of the at home service and us ii class action lawsuits against us att and others in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging securities law violations and common law fraud in connection with disclosures made by at home in 2001 and iii a lawsuit brought in the united states district court for the district of delaware in the name of at home by certain at home bondholders against us brian l roberts cox and others alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the march 2000 transactions and seeking recovery of alleged shortswing profits of at least 600 million pursuant to section 16b of the exchange act purported to have arisen in connection with certain transactions relating to at home stock effected pursuant to the march 2000 agreements 

  

the actions in san mateo county california item i above have been stayed by the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california the court in which at home filed for bankruptcy as violating the automatic bankruptcy stay the decision to stay the actions was affirmed by the district court and the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in the southern district of new york actions item ii above the court has dismissed the common law fraud claims against all defendants leaving only the securities law claims in a subsequent decision the court limited the remaining claims against us and mr roberts to disclosures that are alleged to have been made by at home prior to august 28 2000 in march 2005 the court certified a class of all purchasers of publicly traded at home stock between march 28 2000 and september 28 2001 plaintiffs have moved to amend the complaint so as to move the commencement of the class period back to november 9 1999 we are opposing this amendment and have also moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to properly allege loss causation the delaware case item iii above was transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the court dismissed the section 16b claims against us for failure to state a claim and the breach of fiduciary duty claim for lack of federal jurisdiction the plaintiffs have appealed the decision dismissing the section 16b claims and have recommenced the breach of fiduciary duty claim in delaware chancery court we have filed a motion to dismiss the chancery court claim 

  

under the terms of the broadband acquisition we are contractually liable for 50 of any liabilities of att relating to certain at home litigation for litigation in which we are contractually liable for 50 of any liabilities att will be liable for the other 50 in addition to the actions against att described in items i ii and iii above in which we are also a defendant such litigation matters included two additional actions brought by at home’s bondholders’ liquidating trust against att and not naming us i a lawsuit filed against att and certain of its senior officers in santa clara california state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action and ii an action filed against att in the district court for the northern district of california alleging that att infringes an at home patent by using its broadband distribution and highspeed internet backbone networks and equipment in may 2005 at home bondholders’ liquidating trust and att agreed to settle these two actions pursuant to the settlement att agreed to pay 340 million to the bondholders’ liquidating trust the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court and these two actions were dismissed as a result of the settlement by att we recorded a 170 million charge to other income expense reflecting our portion of the settlement amount in our first quarter 2005 financial results in may 2005 we paid this amount and we have classified such payment as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows 

  

we deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against us our subsidiaries and brian l roberts and are defending all of these claims vigorously the final disposition of these 

  

claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  

att—wireless and common stock cases 

  

under the terms of the broadband acquisition we are potentially responsible for a portion of the liabilities arising from two purported securities class action lawsuits brought against att and others and consolidated for pretrial purposes in the united states district court for the district of new jersey these lawsuits assert claims under section 11 and section 12a2 of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 10b of the exchange act 

  

the first lawsuit for which our portion of any loss is up to 15 alleges that att made material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement and prospectus for the att wireless initial public offering “wireless case” in march 2004 the plaintiffs and att and the other defendants moved for summary judgment in the wireless case the new jersey district court denied the motions and the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation remanded the cases for trial to the united states district court for the southern district of new york where they had originally been brought a trial date has been set for april 19 2006 we and att believe that att has meritorious defenses in the wireless case and it is being vigorously defended 

  

the second lawsuit for which our portion of any loss is 50 alleges that att knowingly provided false projections relating to att common stock “common stock case” in october 2004 the plaintiffs and att and the other defendants agreed to settle the common stock case for 100 million some class members have objected to the amount and apportionment of the fees of class counsel and have appealed to the third circuit court of appeals in may 2005 we paid 50 million representing our share of the settlement amount and we have classified such payment as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows 

  

att—tci cases 

  

in june 1998 the first of a number of purported class action lawsuits was filed by thenshareholders of telecommunications inc “tci” series a tci group common stock “common a” against att and the directors of tci relating to the acquisition of tci by att a consolidated amended complaint combining the various different actions was filed in february 1999 in the delaware court of chancery the consolidated amended complaint alleges that former members of the tci board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to common a shareholders by agreeing to transaction terms whereby holders of the series b tci group common stock received a 10 premium over what common a shareholders received in connection with the transaction the complaint further alleges that att aided and abetted the tci directors’ breach of their fiduciary duties 

  

in connection with the tci acquisition which was completed in early 1999 att agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify tci’s former directors for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities potentially including those incurred in connection with this action in connection with the broadband acquisition we agreed to indemnify att for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities those losses and expenses potentially include those incurred by att in connection with this action both as a defendant and in connection with any obligation that att may have to indemnify the former tci directors for liabilities incurred as a result of the claims against them 

  

in july 2003 the delaware court of chancery granted att’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to adequately plead att’s “knowing participation” as required to state a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty in february 2005 the former tci director defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in december 2005 the court issued a ruling that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the merger was fair to the common a shareholders among other matters the final disposition of these 

  

claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  

patent litigation 

  

we are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses in certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants and also in certain of these cases we expect that any potential liability would be the responsibility of our equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions to the extent that the allegations in these lawsuits can be analyzed by us at this stage of their proceedings we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  

other 

  

we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity

description of our businesses 

cable 

we are the largest cable operator in the united states as of december 31 2004 our consolidated cable operations served 215 million subscribers in thirtyfive states passed 408 million homes and provided digital cable to 87 million subscribers highspeed internet to 70 million subscribers and phone to 12 million subscribers 

the table below summarizes certain information for our cable operations as of december 31 homes and subscribers in millions 

 1 on november 18 2002 we completed the acquisition of att corps broadband business which we refer to as broadband and the broadband acquisition the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and direct comparisons of our cable information for periods prior to november 18 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful the information as of december 31 2002 excludes the operating statistics for broadband cable systems held for sale 2 on december 31 2000 and january 1 2001 we completed our cable systems exchanges with att and adelphia respectively in april and june 2001 we acquired cable systems serving an aggregate of approximately 697000 subscribers from att the subscriber information as of december 31 2000 excludes the effects of our exchange with att 3 a home is passed if we can connect it to our distribution system without further extending the transmission lines as described in note 4 below in the case of certain multiple dwelling units mdus homes passed are counted on an adjusted basis homes passed is an estimate based on the best available information 4 generally a dwelling or commercial unit with one or more television sets connected to a system counts as one cable subscriber in the case of some mdus we count cable subscribers on an fcc equivalent basis by dividing total revenue received from a contract with an mdu by the standard residential rate where the specific mdu is located 5 a subscriber is digital ready if the subscriber is in a market where we have launched our digital cable service 6 a dwelling with one or more digital settop boxes counts as one digital cable subscriber on average as of december 31 2004 each digital cable subscriber had 15 digital settop boxes 3 

7 a home passed is available if we can connect it to our distribution system without further upgrading the transmission lines and if we offer the service in that area 8 prior to the broadband acquisition the number of phone available homes and subscribers was not material cable services 

we offer a variety of services over our cable networks including video highspeed internet and phone over the past several years we have increased the reliability and capacity of our systems enabling us to deliver new services such as digital cable highspeed internet and phone as of december 31 2004 approximately 99 of our cable systems are capable of handling twoway communications although our upgrade is substantially complete we expect to make significant capital expenditures during 2005 associated with the continued growth of these new services 

video services 

we offer a full range of video services we tailor both our basic channel lineup and our additional channel offerings to each system according to demographics programming preferences and local regulation subscribers typically pay us on a monthly basis and generally may discontinue services at any time monthly subscription rates and related charges vary according to the type of service selected and the type of equipment subscribers use our video service offerings include the following 

  basic and expanded basic  our basic cable service typically consists of 1020 channels of programming this service generally consists of programming provided by national television networks local broadcast television stations locallyoriginated programming including governmental and public access and limited satellitedelivered programming our expanded basic cable service includes a group of satellitedelivered or nonbroadcast channels typically consisting of 5060 channels in addition to the basic channel lineup 

  premium channel programming  our premium channel programming service which includes cable networks such as home box office showtime starz and cinemax generally offers without commercial interruption feature motion pictures live and taped sporting events concerts and other special features 

  payperview programming  our payperview service permits our subscribers to order for a separate fee individual feature motion pictures and special event programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts on an unedited commercialfree basis

  video on demand vod  our vod service allows digital cable subscribers the opportunity to choose from a library of thousands of programs start the programs at whatever time is convenient and pause rewind or fastforward the programs a substantial portion of our vod content is available at no additional charge 

  highdefinition television hdtv  hdtv features improved highresolution picture quality improved audio quality and a widescreen theaterlike display our hdtv service offers a broad selection of highdefinition programming of most major broadcast networks leading cable channels premium channels and regional sports networks 

  digital video recorder dvr  our dvr service lets digital subscribers select record and store programs and play them at whatever time is convenient dvr service also provides the ability to pause and rewind live television 

highspeed internet services 

we offer highspeed internet access via our cable modems providing a service that is constantly connected this service also includes our interactive portal comcastnet which provides multiple email addresses online storage and a variety of valueadded features and enhancements designed to take advantage of the speed of the internet connection we provide 

phone services 

in some areas we offer traditional circuitswitched local phone service a full array of associated calling features and thirdparty longdistance services we are also beginning to offer a phone service delivered over our broadband communications networks involving voice transmissions using internet protocol digital voice 

advertising 

as part of our programming carriage agreements with nonbroadcast networks we often receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time into which we may insert commercials we sell advertising time to local regional and national advertisers for insertion on these channels 

we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in certain markets utilizing these arrangements and similar arrangements with other companies we have formed and operate advertising interconnects which establish a physical direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the insertion primarily of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas 

regional sports and news networks 

our regional sports and news networks provide programming to our cable subscribers these regional networks include comcast sportsnet comcast sportsnet midatlantic cable sports southeast cn8—the comcast network and launched in 2004 comcast sportsnet chicago and comcast sportsnet west sacramento these networks sell advertising time and enter into affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies 

other revenue sources 

we also generate revenues from installation services commissions from thirdparty electronic retailing and from other services such as providing businesses with internet connectivity and networked business applications 

programming 

we generally acquire a license for the programming we sell to our subscribers by paying a monthly fee to the licensor on a per subscriber per channel basis our programming costs are increased by 

• growth in the number of subscribers • expansion of the number of channels provided to subscribers and • increases in contract rates from programming suppliers we attempt to secure longterm programming contracts with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives from programming suppliers our programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time and are subject to negotiated renewal we expect our programming costs to remain our largest single expense item for the foreseeable future in recent years the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of programming particularly sports programming we anticipate our programming expenses will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased costs to purchase programming and as additional programming is provided to our subscribers we anticipate that these increases may be mitigated to some extent by volume discounts 

customer and technical service 

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers generally our call centers provide 24 hours per day 7 days per week call answering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services function performs various tasks including cable installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and activities related to customer service 

technology development 

historically we have relied on thirdparty hardware and software vendors for many of the technologies needed for the operation of our businesses the addition of new features to existing services and the development and commercialization of new service offerings in recent years we have begun developing strategically important software and technologies internally and integrating thirdparty software to our specifications we have also now arranged for longterm access rights to national fiberbased networks that we actively manage to interconnect our local and regional distribution systems and facilitate the efficient delivery of our broadband services we expect these efforts to continue and expand in the future these efforts require greater initial expenditures than would be required if we continued to purchase or license these products and services from third parties 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are primarily directed toward generating incremental revenues and increasing the number of subscribers we serve we sell our products and services through direct customer contact through our call centers doortodoor selling direct mail advertising cable television advertising local media advertising telemarketing and retail outlets 

competition 

we operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive environment our cable communications systems compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means in addition we operate in a technologically complex environment and new technologies may increase further the number of competitors we face for our video highspeed internet and phone services and advertising we expect advances in communications technology to continue in the future we are unable to predict what effects if any such future developments will have on our business and operations 

video services 

we compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

• program distributors that use direct broadcast satellite or dbs systems that transmit satellite signals containing video programming data and other information to receiving dishes of varying sizes located on the subscribers premises • local exchange carriers commonly known as lecs that are marketing dbs service and some that are building wireline fiberoptic networks and beginning to provide service in various communities across the united states • other wireline communications providers who build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve including those operating as franchised cable operators or under an alternative regulatory scheme known as open video systems or ovs • satellite master antenna television systems commonly known as smatvs that generally serve condominiums apartment and office complexes and residential developments • local television broadcast stations that provide free overtheair programming which can be received using an antenna and a television set • digital subscription services transmitted over local television broadcast stations that can be received by a special settop box • interactive online computer services including internet video streaming and distribution of movies • video stores and home video products • movie theaters • newspapers magazines and bookstores and • live concerts and sporting events in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc recently adopted rules favoring new investment by lecs in fiberoptic networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that are expected to compete with our video service offerings in order to compete effectively we strive to provide at a reasonable price to subscribers new products and services superior technical performance and customer service and a greater variety of video programming 

dbs systems according to recent government and industry reports conventional medium and highpower satellites currently provide video programming to over 24 million subscribers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer to their subscribers more than 300 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and echostar provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

dbs service can be received throughout the continental united states through a small rooftop or sidemounted outside antenna dbs systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and quality of signals delivered to subscribers by dbs systems 

federal legislation establishes among other things a compulsory copyright license that permits dbs systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who reside in the local television stations market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we currently serve additionally federal law generally provides dbs systems with access to all cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite as a result dbs providers are competitive with cable system operators like us because they offer programming that closely resembles what we offer these dbs providers are attempting to expand their service offerings to include among other things highspeed internet service and have entered marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by lecs such as verizon communications inc sbc communications inc bellsouth corporation and qwest communications international inc 

local exchange carriers lecs in addition to entering into joint marketing arrangements with dbs providers some lecs are building fiberoptic networks capable of distributing video programming the lecs to date have taken various positions on the question of whether they need a local cable television franchise to provide video services including applying for a local franchise seeking statelevel regulation only and claiming that video services can be provided without a cable television franchise 

other wireline providers we operate our cable systems pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise that is issued by the communitys governing body such as a city council a county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency 

federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems companies that traditionally have not provided cable services and that have substantial financial resources such as public utilities that own some of the poles to which our cables are attached may also obtain cable franchises and may provide competing communications services these and other wireline communications systems offer video and other communications services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will emerge in other franchise areas that we serve 

smatv our cable systems also compete for subscribers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation like local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellitedelivered programming services offered by our cable systems in addition some smatv operators are offering packages of phone data and video services to private residential and commercial developments smatv system operators often enter into exclusive service agreements with building owners or homeowners associations although some states have enacted laws to provide cable systems access to multiple dwelling units 

broadcast subscription services over the past year local television broadcasters in selected markets have begun deployment of digital subscription services these services typically contain a limited number of cable programming services at a price of approximately 20 per month recently several leading television broadcast station ownership groups announced that they are negotiating funding for us digital television inc an entity that currently offers these digital subscription services in select markets and has announced plans to offer its service in several additional markets as a low cost alternative to cable television service many other broadcasters are considering similar plans 

highspeed internet services 

substantially all of our cable systems offer highspeed internet services within their service areas these systems compete with a number of other companies many of whom have substantial resources including 

• lecs • internet service providers isps such as america online earthlink inc and microsoft • longdistance telephone companies and • wireless telephone companies and other providers of wireless internet services the deployment of digital subscriber line or dsl technology allows internet access to be provided to subscribers over analog lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional modems numerous companies have introduced dsl service and some of these companies are seeking to provide highspeed internet services without regard to their present service boundaries and other regulatory restrictions in addition some lecs have begun construction of fiberoptic networks that will allow them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed the speed that can be provided with dsl technology the fcc has reduced the obligations of lecs to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale basis to competitors and is considering further measures to deregulate lecs retail broadband offerings congress may also consider measures to deregulate such broadband offerings 

various wireless telephone companies are beginning to offer wireless highspeed internet services in addition in a growing number of commercial areas such as retail malls restaurants and airports wireless wifi internet access capability is available numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publiclysubsidized wifi internet access networks the availability of these alternatives may adversely affect demand for our highspeed internet services 

a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we reached access agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps although to date these isps have made limited use of their access rights we cannot provide any assurance however that regulatory authorities will not impose open access or similar requirements on us as part of an industrywide requirement these requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2004 a number of competitors offered substantial price discounts to subscribers willing to sign extended contracts or purchase additional bundled services we expect competition for highspeed internet service subscribers to remain intense with companies competing on service availability price transmission speed and bundled services 

phone services 

our traditional circuitswitched local phone service and digital voice service compete against incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs wireless telephone service providers competitive lecs including established longdistance companies and other internet protocol phone ip phone service providers the ilecs have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few competitive lecs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

in addition many telecommunications carriers are expanding their offerings to include highspeed internet access services and as such access services become more widely deployed ip phone services will likely become more popular we anticipate that our digital voice service will be deployed over the next two years in substantially all of our cable systems we expect to migrate our circuitswitched phone customers to our digital voice service over the next several years our competitors are engaging in similar deployment strategies and the proliferation of ip phone services may negatively affect demand for and pricing of our phone services 

advertising 

our cable systems compete against a wide variety of media for sales of advertising including local television broadcast stations national television broadcast networks national cable television networks local radio broadcast stations local and regional newspapers magazines and the internet continuing competition from these media outlets and the continued expansion of new media outlets offering advertising opportunities may result in a dilution of the portion of advertising expenditures our cable systems currently receive 

content 

we have made investments in national cable television networks as a means of generating additional revenues and subscriber interest as of december 31 2004 these investments include the following approximate subscribers in millions 

 other businesses and programming interests 

we own a controlling interest in comcastspectacor our group of businesses that perform live sporting events and own or manage facilities for sporting events concerts and other special events we also own other noncontrolling interests in programming investments including in demand tv one sports channel new england new england cable news pittsburgh cable news channel and music choice 

legislation and regulation 

our video and phone services are subject to numerous requirements prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws and regulations local ordinances and our franchise agreements our highspeed internet service while not currently subject to significant regulation may be subject to such regulation in the future our content businesses are generally not subject to direct governmental regulation laws and regulations affect the prices we can charge for some services such as basic cable service and associated customerpremises equipment the costs we incur for example for attaching our wires to poles owned by utility companies the relationships we establish with our suppliers subscribers and competitors and many other aspects of our businesses 

the most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the communications act of 1934 as amended the provisions of the communications act and the manner in which the fcc state and local authorities and the courts implement and interpret those provisions affect our ability to develop and execute business plans our ability to raise capital and the competitive dynamics between and among different sectors of the communications and entertainment industries in which we operate the fcc also has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders and the imposition of other administrative sanctions such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate some of the transmission facilities we use in connection with our cable business 

we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by or under the communications act but we caution that the precise requirements of the law are not always clear moreover many laws and regulations can be interpreted in afterthefact enforcement proceedings or privateparty litigation in a manner that is inconsistent with the judgments we have made we also note that regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing rules or prescribe new ones judicial decisions often alter the regulatory framework in ways that are inconsistent with regulator business and investor expectations in addition our businesses can be significantly affected by the enactment of new legislation congress seriously considers the enactment of new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year and a significant initiative to update the communications act has begun this year we always face the risk that congress or a state will approve legislation significantly 

affecting our businesses in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we are subject to new laws or regulations that do not equally affect our satellite wireline and wireless competitors 

a major objective of congress and the fcc has been to increase competition in all communications services including those central to our business for example congress has removed barriers to local telephone companies offering video services in their local service areas and the fcc has taken additional steps that are encouraging local telephone companies to expand their investment in fiberoptic networks which would make it easier for those companies to deliver video highspeed internet and other services the fcc has also assigned spectrum licenses for mvdds a new wireless service providing multichannel video programming in addition the fcc is continuing to adopt measures to increase the capacity for satellitedelivered services and is currently pursuing efforts intended to facilitate the use of utility power lines to provide video and highspeed internet services our cable business could be affected by additional competitors that enter the video or highspeed internet businesses as a result of these and similar efforts by congress or the fcc in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to these new competitors such as if local telephone companies that provide video programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements that apply to us 

there are potential risks associated with various potential new laws or regulations or proceedings that are currently pending at the fcc in the courts and before state regulatory agencies and local franchise authorities we believe few of these items have the potential to materially affect our ability to conduct our cable business 

the following paragraphs describe existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements that are the most significant to our businesses today 

broadband acquisition 

the fcc approved the broadband acquisition in november 2002 subject to various conditions the most significant were a requirement for the divestiture of our interest in twc by may 2008 a requirement that the twc interest be placed in trust pending divestiture and safeguards that limit our involvement in the programmingrelated activities of twc and the two partnerships held jointly by us and twc pending divestiture complying with these conditions has limited and will continue to limit our flexibility as to the timing and nature of a sale or other disposition of the twc interest and in the interim may constrain our business dealings with twc we have fully complied with these conditions and are committed to meeting our obligations under the fccs order going forward 

ownership limits 

the fcc is considering imposing horizontal ownership limits that would limit the percentage of multichannel video subscribers that any single cable provider could serve nationwide a federal appellate court struck down the previous 30 limit and the fcc is now considering this issue anew as we already serve approximately 29 of multichannel video subscribers limits similar to those previously imposed would restrict our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate vertical ownership limits on the number of affiliated programming services a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels was also invalidated by the federal appellate court new vertical limits could affect our contentrelated business plans in addition the fcc is considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules that would affect which cable subscribers are counted under any horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted for purposes of any vertical ownership limit it is uncertain when the fcc will rule on these cable ownership issues in addition it is possible that the controversy relating to separate ownership rules for the broadcast industry could affect the cable ownership proceeding and the fccs deliberations over cable ownership issues 

pricing and packaging 

the communications act and the fccs regulations and policies limit the prices that cable systems may charge for basic services and equipment these rules do not apply to cable systems that are determined by the fcc to be subject to effective competition but these determinations have thus far been made for only a small number of our cable systems failure to comply with these rate rules could result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers from time to time congress considers imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry including proposals to require cable operators to offer programming services on an a la carte basis instead of or in addition to the current packaged offerings we cannot now predict whether or when congress or any regulatory agency may adopt any new constraints on the pricing or packaging of cable services also various competitors are trying to persuade the fcc and the justice department to limit our ability to respond to increased competition through offers promotions or other discounts that aim to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost we believe our competitive pricing practices are lawful and procompetitive if we cannot make individualized offers to subscribers who would otherwise choose a different provider our subscriber attrition may increase or our overall prices may need to be reduced or both 

highspeed internet service 

ever since highspeed internet service was introduced some local governments and various competitors have sought to impose regulatory requirements on how we deal with thirdparty isps thus far only a few local governments have imposed such 

requirements and the courts have invalidated all of them likewise the fcc has refused to treat our service as a common carrier telecommunications service but has instead classified it as an interstate information service which has historically meant that no regulations apply however the fccs decision was vacated by a panel of a federal appellate court which found that highspeed internet service is in part a telecommunications service that decision was stayed pending an appeal to the united states supreme court which decided in december 2004 to hear the case thus it is unclear how our highspeed internet service will ultimately be classified for regulatory purposes or whether we will be subject to requirements regarding our dealings with thirdparty isps any such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations in addition even if the fccs decision is upheld the fcc will then renew its assessment of whether to impose any regulatory requirements on highspeed internet service and also whether local franchising authorities should be permitted to impose fees or other requirements such as service quality or customer service standards one local franchise authority has already imposed some of these requirements and made them a condition of our cable franchise agreement and other local governments may follow suit also a few franchising authorities have sued us seeking payment of franchise fees on highspeed internet service revenues further a number of software and content providers and electronic retailers have urged the fcc to adopt nondiscrimination principles that purport to be intended to allow internet customers access to the internet content of their choosing something we already provide we cannot now predict whether these or similar regulations will be adopted and if so what effects if any they would have on our business 

internet regulation 

congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial email further state and local governmental organizations have also adopted internetrelated regulations these various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas such as pricing service and product quality and intellectual property ownership the adoption of new laws or the adaptation of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet service 

mustcarryretransmission consent 

cable companies are currently subject to a requirement that they carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most commercial and noncommercial local television stations mustcarry alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for retransmission consent which may enable popular stations to demand significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks as a condition of our ability to transmit the tv broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive as broadcasters transition from analog to digital transmission technologies the fcc is considering whether to require cable companies to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each broadcaster it is also considering whether to allow broadcasters to choose mustcarry for either their analog or digital signals during this transition period additionally it is considering whether following the digital transition and the return of broadcaster analog spectrum to the government a cable company may be required to carry multiple digital programming streams that each broadcaster may include within its digital transmission if the fcc should adopt such mustcarry requirements we would have less freedom to allocate the usable spectrum of our cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to our subscribers this could diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers in addition expanded mustcarry requirements may similarly reduce the freedom of other cable operators to allocate use of their cable plant this could adversely impact the ability of our cable networks to maintain or increase their carriage although the fcc has thus far ruled against expanded mustcarry requirements we cannot now predict whether such requirements may result from additional fcc proceedings judicial proceedings or legislation 

program access 

the communications act and the fccs program access rules generally prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video distributors such as dbs and limit the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2007 the fcc has concluded that the program access rules generally do not apply to programming services such as comcast sportsnet philadelphia that are delivered terrestrially the fcc has also indicated that it may reconsider how it regulates cable operators with regional sports programming interests in its cable ownership rulemaking and there has been some congressional interest in extending the exclusivity prohibition to terrestriallydelivered programming any decision by the fcc or congress to apply new regulations to cable operators like us who have regional sports programming interests could have an adverse impact on our cable and programming businesses 

cable equipment issues 

current fcc rules bar cable operators from leasing to subscribers digital settop boxes that integrate security and other operating functions effective july 1 2006 the fcc is conducting a rulemaking on the ban and we have urged elimination of the ban on the grounds that it will limit consumer choice increase the cost of settop box equipment and slow the deployment of digital cable services but there is no assurance that the fcc will accept our position in addition the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of 

plugandplay tv sets that can connect directly to the cable network and receive oneway analog and digital cable services without the need for a settop box among other things the rules direct cable operators to implement technical standards in their networks to support these digital television sets require operators to provide a sufficient supply of conditional access devices to subscribers who want to receive encrypted programming services on their digital television sets and require operators to support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules for digital programming content we believe that we are substantially in compliance with these plugandplay requirements these rules are being challenged at the fcc and in the courts and we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these challenges in addition the fcc has initiated a rulemaking that will consider additional plugandplay regulations including standards for approving new digital connectors and copy protection technologies that cable operators would have to support it is uncertain when the fcc will complete this rulemaking and how it might affect cable operators also the cable and consumer electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would allow for the manufacture of twoway interactive plugandplay equipment once this agreement is finalized it will likely be subject to a separate fcc rulemaking it is unclear how this process will unfold and how it will ultimately affect our cable business and our efforts to sell cable services at retail outlets 

phone service 

our traditional circuitswitched phone service is subject to federal state and local regulation in general the communications act imposes interconnection requirements and universal service contribution obligations on all telecommunications service providers including those that provide traditional circuitswitched phone service over cable facilities and more significant regulations on ilecs such as verizon and sbc these traditional commoncarrier rules however are being reevaluated at the fcc and in congress for example the fcc has initiated several rulemakings that in the aggregate could significantly change the rules that apply to telephone competition including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers longdistance and local providers and incumbents and new entrants it is unclear how those proceedings and the litigation and implementation proceedings that are already under way as a product of one such rulemaking will affect our phone service 

we are beginning to launch our digital voice service on a limited commercial basis the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider whether and how to regulate ip phone and other ipenabled services among other things the fcc will determine whether and how certain types of commoncarrier regulations should apply to ip phone including intercarrier compensation universal service 911 emergency services and disabilities access obligations the fcc has also initiated a separate rulemaking to consider whether to impose communications assistance to law enforcement act requirements on ip phone as well as broadband internet access services several states have already attempted to impose traditional commoncarrier regulation on ip phone services however the fcc adopted an order in november 2004 declaring that one particular ip phone service is not subject to traditional state public utility regulation further the fcc indicated that other types of ip phone services such as those offered by cable companies would not be subject to traditional state public utility regulation if they require a broadband connection from the users location require the use of ipcompatible customer premises equipment and include a suite of integrated capabilities and features able to be invoked sequentially or simultaneously that allows customers to manage personal communications dynamically it is unclear how this ruling and other ip phonerelated proceedings at the federal and state levels and the related judicial proceedings that will ensue might affect our planned ip phone service 

franchise matters 

cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction these franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act includes provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we anticipate that our future franchise renewal prospects generally will be favorable 

leased accesspeg 

the communications act permits franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside the use of channels for public educational and governmental access programming the communications act also requires a cable system with 36 or more activated channels to make available a portion of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator to date we have generally not been required to devote significant channel capacity to leased access 

state and local taxes 

some states and localities are considering imposing new taxes including sales taxes on the services we offer we cannot predict at this time whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business 

other regulatory issues 

there are a number of other regulatory matters under review by congress the fcc and other federal agencies that could affect our cable business 

• tier buy through the communications act generally requires cable operators to allow subscribers to purchase premium or payperview services without the necessity of subscribing to any tier of service other than the basic service tier the applicability of this rule in certain situations remains unclear and adverse decisions by the fcc on this issue could affect our pricing and packaging of services • content regulation the communications act prohibits the transmission of obscene programming over cable systems additionally some parties have proposed that new laws or rules regulating indecent and violent programming be imposed on cable operators it is uncertain whether and when any such laws will be enacted or regulations will be adopted and if enacted or adopted what impact such laws or regulations would have on our businesses • broadcast flag the fcc has adopted rules that require cable operators to implement the broadcast flag a code that may be embedded in digital broadcast programming that directs digital tvs and other consumer electronics equipment to block the redistribution of such content over the internet it is unclear how these rules might affect the future design of cablerelated equipment and homenetworking technologies several petitions have been filed at the fcc requesting revisions to the broadcast flag rules the rules are also subject to a challenge in federal court we cannot now predict how or when the fcc will rule on these petitions or how the federal court will decide the case the fcc has also initiated a rulemaking to consider among other things whether cable operators should be permitted to encrypt digital basic services it is uncertain when this rulemaking will be completed and how it will affect cable operators • mdu access the fcc has adopted rules intended to make it easier for multichannel video service providers to compete with established cable operators in serving multiple dwelling units mdus such as apartment buildings and condominium complexes • pole attachments the communications act requires that utilities other than those owned by municipalities or cooperatives provide cable systems with nondiscriminatory access to any pole or rightofway controlled by the utility the rates that utilities may charge for such access are regulated by the fcc or alternatively by states that certify to the fcc that they regulate such rates several states in which we have cable systems have so certified there is always the possibility that the fcc or a state could alter the pole attachment rate paid by cable operators and such adverse decisions could potentially increase our pole attachment costs additionally higher pole attachment rates will apply to pole attachments that are subject to the fccs telecommunications services pole rates the applicability of and method for calculating those rates for cable systems over which various phone services are transmitted remains unclear • eas and closed captioning the fcc has initiated a rulemaking to consider changes to the emergency alert system eas the proposed rules changes if adopted would impose additional requirements and costs on cable operators including among other things installation of new eas equipment in cable headends and delivery of eas warnings via digital cable services it is uncertain when and if the fcc will act on these proposals the fcc has also invited comment on a petition for a rulemaking with respect to closed captioning requirements for cable operators broadcasters programmers and others advocates for the hearing impaired have urged the fcc to toughen its rules on closed captioning compliance and enforcement if adopted such requirements would impose further regulatory burdens on cable operators the fcc has not indicated whether it will proceed with the rulemaking • privacy regulation the communications act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure of subscribers personal information by cable operators there are possible interpretations of the communications act that could severely limit the ability of service providers to collect and use personal information for commercial purposes further constraints could be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities establish their own privacy standards in addition the fcc the federal trade commission and many states have adopted rules that limit the telemarketing practices of cable operators and other commercial entities • copyright regulation in exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenue to a us federal copyright royalty pool cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material contained in broadcast signals the us copyright office has recommended that congress revise this compulsory licensing scheme although congress has thus far declined to do so the elimination or substantial modification of the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain programming and substantially increase our programming costs further the copyright office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to digital broadcast signals and services in addition we pay standard industry licensing fees to use music in the programs we provide to cable subscribers including local advertising local origination programming and payperview events these licensing fees have been the source of litigation between the cable industry and music performance rights organizations in the past and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future • other areas the fcc actively regulates other aspects of our cable business including among other things 1 the mandatory blackout of syndicated network and sports programming 2 customer service standards 3 advertising in childrens programming 4 political advertising 5 origination cablecasting ie programming locally originated by and under the control of the 12 

cable operator 6 sponsorship identification 7 equal employment opportunity 8 lottery programming 9 program carriage 10 recordkeeping and public file access requirements and 11 technical standards relating to operation of the cable network we are not aware that the fcc is considering any significant revisions to these rules at this time but we are unable to predict how these regulations might be changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our cable business 

in all these areas and a variety of others we face the potential of increased regulation given the intensely competitive nature of every aspect of our business we believe that increased regulation is not warranted we cannot provide any assurance however that regulation of our businesses will not increase 

employees 

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 74000 employees of these employees approximately 59000 were associated with cable and approximately 15000 were associated with our other divisions approximately 3000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

risk factors 

all of the services offered by our cable systems face a wide range of competition that could adversely affect our future results of operations 

our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers we compete directly with other program distributors including satellite companies telephone companies companies that build competing cable systems in the same communities we serve and companies that offer programming and other communications services to our subscribers and potential subscribers some local telephone companies provide or have announced plans to provide video services within and outside their telephone service areas additionally we are subject to competition from telecommunications providers and isps in connection with offerings of new and advanced services including telecommunications and internet services this competition may materially adversely affect our business and operations in the future 

programming costs are increasing which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

programming costs are expected to continue to be our largest single expense item in the foreseeable future in recent years the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of programming if we are unable to raise our subscribers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in addition as we upgrade the channel capacity of our systems and add programming to our basic expanded basic and digital programming services we may face increased programming costs that in conjunction with the additional pricing constraints may reduce operating margins however we do expect additional volume discounts associated with our future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers we cannot predict the impact of these demands or the effect on our business and operations should we fail to obtain the required consents 

we are subject to regulation by federal state and local governments which may impose costs and restrictions 

federal state and local governments extensively regulate the cable industry and the circuitswitched phone services industry and may begin regulating the internet services industry we expect that legislative enactments court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to clarify and in some cases change the rights and obligations of cable companies and other entities under the communications act and other laws possibly in ways that we have not foreseen the results of these legislative judicial and administrative actions may materially affect our business operations local authorities grant us franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems we have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time local franchising authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal or transfer and such concessions or other commitments could be costly to us in the future 

we may face increased competition because of technological advances and new regulatory requirements which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

numerous companies including telephone companies have introduced dsl technology which provides internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional analog modems we expect other advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace to occur in the future other new technologies and services may develop and may compete with services that cable systems offer including video services the success of these ongoing and future developments could have an adverse effect on our business operations moreover in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems 

we face risks arising from the outcome of various litigation matters including litigation associated with our acquisition of atts broadband operations 

we are involved in various litigation matters including those arising in the ordinary course of business and those described under the caption legal proceedings in item 3 to this annual report among these matters is litigation associated with our acquisition of atts broadband operations and for which att controls the defense of the litigation while we do not believe that any of these litigation matters alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations for any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our operations 

brian l roberts has significant control over our operations through his beneficial ownership of all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock which have a nondilutable 33 1  3  of the combined voting power of our common stock and separate approval rights over certain material transactions involving us

we deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against us our subsidiaries and brian l roberts and are defending all of these claims vigorously the final disposition of these claims and the final resolution of our share if any of the att at home potential liabilities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

att—wireless and common stock cases 

under the terms of the broadband acquisition we are potentially responsible for a portion of the liabilities arising from two purported securities class action lawsuits brought against att and others and consolidated for pretrial purposes in the united states district court for the district of new jersey these lawsuits assert claims under section 11 and section 12a2 of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 10b of the 1934 act 

the first lawsuit for which our portion of any loss is up to 15 alleges among other things that att made material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement and prospectus for the att wireless initial public offering wireless case in march 2004 the plaintiffs and att and the other defendants moved for summary judgment in the wireless case the new jersey district court denied the motions and the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation remanded the cases for trial to the united states district court for the southern district of new york where they had originally been brought no trial date has been set we and att believe that att has meritorious defenses in the wireless case and it is being vigorously defended 

the second lawsuit for which our portion of any loss is 50 alleges among other things that att knowingly provided false projections relating to att common stock common stock case in october 2004 the plaintiffs and att and the other defendants agreed to settle the common stock case for 100 million which was preliminarily approved by the court we expect final approval of the settlement by the court in the second quarter of 2005 we have agreed to pay 50 million of the settlement amount 

in november 2004 att brought suit against the do insurers in delaware superior court seeking a declaration of coverage and damages in the at home cases the wireless case and the common stock case this litigation is in its very early stages 

att—tci 

in june 1998 the first of a number of purported class action lawsuits was filed by thenshareholders of telecommunications inc tci series a tci group common stock common a against att and the directors of tci relating to the acquisition of tci by att a consolidated amended complaint combining the various different actions was filed in february 1999 in the delaware court of chancery the consolidated amended complaint alleges that former members of the tci board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to common a shareholders by agreeing to transaction terms whereby holders of the series b tci group common stock received a 10 premium over what common a shareholders received in connection with the transaction the complaint further alleges that att aided and abetted the tci directors breach of their fiduciary duties 

in connection with the tci acquisition which was completed in early 1999 att agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify tcis former directors for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities potentially including those incurred in connection with this action in connection with the broadband acquisition we agreed to indemnify att for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities those losses and expenses potentially include those incurred by att in connection with this action both as a defendant and in connection with any obligation that att may have to indemnify the former tci directors for liabilities incurred as a result of the claims against them 

in july 2003 the delaware court of chancery granted atts motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to adequately plead atts knowing participation as required to state a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty the other claims made in the complaint remain outstanding fact discovery in this matter is now closed the former tci director defendants anticipate filing a motion for summary judgment in february 2005 no trial date has been set

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are principally involved in the management and operation of broadband communications networks our cable segment and in the management of programming content that is distributed over national cable television networks our content segment in 2004 we received over 95 of our revenue from our cable segment primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video highspeed internet and phone services as well as from advertising subscribers typically pay us monthly based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use revenue from our content segment is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies we have several competitors in each aspect of our businesses including satellite providers dsl providers telephone companies and broadcast networks 

highlights for the year 2004 include the following 

• revenue growth of 104 in our cable segment compared to the year 2003 driven by continued subscriber growth in our digital cable and highspeed internet services and rate increases in our video services our subscriber growth is attributable to new and improved products and advanced services in our digital cable and highspeed internet services these include video on demand vod or on demand highdefinition television hdtv programming and digital video recorders dvrs in our video services and a fast and reliable network enhanced internet portal video mail and additional content in our highspeed internet services • operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of 176 in our cable segment compared to the year 2003 resulting from our revenue growth efficiencies achieved and volumerelated savings based on our size • substantial completion of our cable systems upgrade • investment in and longterm access to technology platforms and national fiberoptic networks that allow us to control the development delivery and quality of our digital and advanced services for our video highspeed internet and phone services and • repurchases of approximately 469 million shares of our class a special common stock for aggregate consideration of 1328 billion pursuant to our board authorized repurchase program the following discussion provides the details of these highlights and insights into our consolidated financial statements including business developments critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements and discussions of our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

business developments 

we operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive highly regulated and technologically complex environment we are the largest video broadband highspeed internet and cable phone service provider in the united states we have substantially completed the upgrade of our broadband communications networks allowing us to provide customers with new and improved products and advanced services in our video highspeed internet and phone services we also have expanded the ownership and management of our content businesses on national regional and local levels 

cable 

on november 18 2002 we completed the acquisition of att corps broadband business which we refer to as broadband and the broadband acquisition the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure including a substantially higher amount of debt as a result direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to november 18 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful 

during 2004 we expanded our efforts to acquire and develop technology that will drive product differentiation and new applications and extend our nationwide fiberoptic network we achieved these objectives in 2004 through strategic agreements signed with gemstartv guide and microsoft which enable us to control and develop the enhancement of the user interface and the functionality of our service offerings such as our interactive programming guide and our vod and dvr service in addition we and gemstar formed an entity to develop and enhance interactive programming guides in december 2004 we also announced a longterm agreement with level 3 communications that is part of the extension of our fiberoptic network this national network or backbone provides a technicallyadvanced nationwide broadband network over which we can deliver new and enhanced services 

content 

on may 10 2004 we completed the acquisition of techtv inc techtv for approximately 300 million in cash on may 28 2004 g4 and techtv began operating as one network that is available to approximately 47 million cable and satellite homes nationwide as of december 31 2004 and provides video and computer gamerelated programming 

on july 28 2004 we exchanged approximately 120 million shares of liberty media corporation liberty series a common stock that we held with liberty for cash of 547 million an additional 104 interest in e entertainment television e entertainment and 100 of international channel networks a cultural and heritagerelated national cable network that is available to approximately 10 million cable homes nationwide as of december 31 2004 

qvc 

on september 17 2003 we completed the sale to liberty of our approximate 57 interest in qvc inc for approximately 77 billion we received from liberty 40 billion of threeyear senior unsecured floating rate notes approximately 218 million shares of liberty series a common stock valued at 2339 billion and cash of 135 billion qvc is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 

refer to general developments of our business in part i and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes and legal contingencies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below 

valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights 

our cable systems are constructed and operated under nonexclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time as of december 31 2004 we served approximately 4500 franchise areas in the united states we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 

we have acquired these cable franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories upon acquisition we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions we control the sourcing of content pricing marketing and branding and capital deployment throughout the company as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset therefore we have concluded that we operate our cable franchise rights as a single asset within our cable segment from time to time however certain cable franchise rights may be separated and sold in units below the cable segment level we have concluded that emerging issues task force 0207 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets are both operated together and essentially inseparable upon the adoption of sfas no 142 in 2002 we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level effective in the first quarter of 2004 we changed the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions 

we assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets discounted cash flow analyses analyses of current market transactions and profitability information including estimated future operating results trends or other determinants of fair value if the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge 

the carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions conversely the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 142 nevertheless testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals including likekind exchanges issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with 

acquisitions and certain financing transactions significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 

in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities and we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that we will be assessed we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent the financial statement effects of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 the consolidated tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax provisions that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow of any one period 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business and in certain cases those that we assume from an acquired entity in a business combination we record an estimated liability for those proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies for those litigation contingencies assumed in a business combination subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 142 we record a liability based on estimated fair value when such fair value is determinable we review outstanding claims with internal as well as external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss the risk of loss is reassessed as new information becomes available and liabilities are adjusted as appropriate the actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded 

significant and subjective estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

results of continuing operations 

consolidated operating results 

revenues 

consolidated revenues for the years 2004 and 2003 increased 1959 billion and 10246 billion respectively from the previous year of these increases 1824 billion and 10142 billion respectively relate to our cable segment and 159 million and 107 million respectively relate to our content segment which are both discussed separately below the remaining changes primarily relate to our other business activities primarily comcastspectacor 

operating selling general and administrative expenses 

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for the years 2004 and 2003 increased 820 million and 6690 billion respectively from the previous year of these increases 703 million and 6590 billion respectively relate to our cable segment and 108 million and 63 million respectively relate to our content segment both of which are discussed separately below the remaining increases relate to our other business activities primarily comcastspectacor and corporate activities 

depreciation 

the changes in depreciation expense for the years 2004 and 2003 are primarily attributable to our cable segment the increase in our cable segment for the year 2004 compared to the previous year is principally due to the higher level of depreciation associated with capital expenditures related to our cable systems upgrade the increase in our cable segment for the year 2003 compared to the previous year is principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition as well as our increased level of capital expenditures 

amortization 

the changes in amortization expense for the years 2004 and 2003 are primarily attributable to our cable segment the decrease in our cable segment for the year 2004 compared to the previous year relates to decreases in the amortization of our franchiserelated customer relationship intangible assets as a result of the broadband acquisition we recorded approximately 34 billion of franchiserelated customer relationship intangible assets which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years in the fourth quarter of 2003 we reduced the value of these intangible assets because we obtained updated valuation reports which resulted in lower amortization expense this decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with intangibles acquired in the gemstar transaction this decrease was also offset by our content segment principally associated with intangibles acquired in the techtv and liberty exchange transactions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for further discussion about these transactions the increase in our cable segment for the year 2003 compared to the previous year relates principally to the effects of the broadband acquisition 

2003 to 2002 historical comparisons 

on november 18 2002 we completed the acquisition of att corps broadband business which we refer to as broadband and the broadband acquisition the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure including a substantially higher amount of debt as a result direct comparisons of our consolidated results of operations for periods prior to november 18 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful please refer to our 2003 to 2002 historical and pro forma cable segment discussion below 

segment operating results 

operating income before depreciation and amortization is the primary basis we use to measure the operational strength and performance of our segments operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization impairment charges if any related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets if any as such it eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations and it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities our management and board of directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments this metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs we believe that this measure is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies because we use operating income before depreciation and amortization as the measure of our segment profit or loss we reconcile it to operating income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 

all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts minor differences may exist due to rounding 

cable segment 

the following table presents our cable segment operating results dollars in millions 

2004 to 2003 historical comparisons 



the following tables present our subscriber and monthly average revenue statistics on both a historical and a pro forma basis the pro forma adjustments reflect the addition of approximately 72000 video subscribers acquired in various small acquisitions during the years presented as though the acquisitions occurred on january 1 2003 the impact of these acquisitions on our segment operating results was not material subscribers in thousands 

  revenues video revenue consists of our basic expanded basic premium payperview and digital cable services as well as equipment rentals the increase in video revenue from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to subscriber growth in our digital video service and rate increases during 2004 we added approximately 990000 digital subscribers the growth in our digital cable subscribers was driven by an increase in consumer demand for new digital services and features such as vod dvrs and hdtv programming and enhancements in digital service packages we expect continued growth in our video revenue 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the addition of approximately 1708000 highspeed internet subscribers in 2004 the growth in highspeed internet subscribers reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable internet service provided over our cable networks we expect continued growth in our highspeed internet revenue 

the decrease in phone revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily a result of our focus on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business rather than focusing on subscriber growth as a result during 2004 our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 44000 subscribers 

the increase in advertising sales revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regionalnational advertising as a result of the continued success of our regional interconnects a stronger local advertising market and an increase in political advertising we expect continued growth in our advertising sales revenue 

other revenue includes installation revenues revenue from our regional sports and news networks guide revenues commissions from electronic retailing revenue from commercial data services and revenue from other service offerings 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 

operating expenses programming expenses represent our single largest operating expense and are fees paid to license programming from cable networks that we distribute package and sell to our video subscribers programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates the number of subscribers and the programming packages offered to subscribers in 2004 programming costs increased 240 million to 4149 billion or 61 from 2003 we anticipate our programming expenses will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased costs to purchase programming and as additional programming is provided to our subscribers we anticipate that these increases will be mitigated to some extent by additional volume discounts 

other operating expenses increased 168 million or 59 from 2003 primarily driven by increases in personnel associated with the growth in our highspeed internet and digital cable services 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 295 million from 2003 primarily driven by increases in marketing costs and the administrative costs associated with growth in our business 

2003 to 2002 historical comparisons 

the following discussion of our cable segment operating results first presents a comparison of the 2003 and 2002 periods on a historical basis which only includes the broadband results subsequent to november 18 2002 in order to provide additional 

information relating to our cable segment operating results we also present a comparison of 2003 actual results to 2002 results on a pro forma basis 

 revenues video revenues increased 6580 billion from 2002 to 2003 of which 6286 billion is attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition and 294 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations driven principally by growth in digital subscribers during 2003 we added approximately 1033000 digital subscribers 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of the broadband acquisition and growth in highspeed internet subscribers during 2003 we added approximately 1692000 highspeed internet subscribers 

the increases in phone advertising sales and other revenue from 2002 to 2003 are primarily attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition our historical operations prior to the broadband acquisition did not contain significant phone revenue 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 

operating expenses programming expenses increased 2271 billion to 3909 billion from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the effects of the broadband acquisition the increase in other operating expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition the effects of an increase in labor costs and other volumerelated expenses and to a lesser extent the effects of highspeed internet subscriber growth 

selling general and administrative expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition 

2003 to 2002 pro forma comparisons 

management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses in the opinion of management this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated broadband since january 1 2002 nor is it indicative of our future results the following table presents our cable segment operating results for 2002 on a pro forma basis and a reconciliation to historical and pro forma data dollars in millions 

 25 

the following tables present our subscriber and monthly average revenue statistics on a pro forma basis as though acquisitions during these years occurred on january 1 2002 subscribers in thousands 

  revenues the increase in video revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service growth in digital subscribers and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the broadband systems during 2003 we added approximately 1033000 digital subscribers 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the addition in 2003 of approximately 1692000 highspeed internet subscribers and is also due to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber 

the decrease in phone revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily a result of our focusing on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business rather than focusing on subscriber growth as a result during 2003 our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 171000 subscribers 

the increase in advertising sales revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regionalnational advertising as a result of the continued success of our regional interconnects offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market 

other revenue includes revenue from our regional sports programming networks installation revenues guide revenues commissions from electronic retailing and reduced revenue from other service offerings 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 

operating expenses programming expenses increased 87 million to 3909 billion or 23 in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily because we were able to negotiate reductions in programming rates principally in premium channels during 2003 

other operating expenses decreased 81 million in 2003 from 2002 primarily due to the effects of cost reductions in the integration of the broadband systems 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses decreased 432 million in 2003 from 2002 primarily driven by reductions in headcount and elimination of redundancies in 2003 in addition the 2002 amounts include 425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by broadband 

content segment 

2004 2003 and 2002 historical comparisons 

the following table presents our content segment operating results dollars in millions 



our content segment consists of the national networks e entertainment and style network e networks the golf channel outdoor life network g4 and international channel networks 

revenues our content segment revenue increased 159 million and 107 million or 253 and 205 for the years 2004 and 2003 respectively compared to the previous year the increases in 2004 and 2003 revenue reflect increases in distribution and advertising revenue for all of the networks and the 2004 acquisitions of techtv and international channel networks 

operating selling general and administrative expenses operating selling general and administrative expenses increased 108 million and 63 million or 261 and 179 for the years 2004 and 2003 respectively compared to the previous year expenses increased in 2004 and 2003 as a result of higher development and marketing expenses for signature events and other original programming in all of our networks as well as to the effects of our acquisitions of techtv and international channel networks during 2004 

consolidated other income expense items 

2004 2003 and 2002 historical comparisions 

interest expense the decrease in interest expense for the year 2004 from 2003 is a result of our debt reduction during 2003 and 2004 and due to the effects of our interest rate risk management program this decrease was offset somewhat by the effects of the writeoff of unamortized debt issue costs to interest expense in connection with the refinancing of our previously existing revolving credit facilities and by the early redemption of a portion of the comcast exchangeable notes the costs during 2004 associated with the refinancing and the redemption totaled 38 million and 31 million respectively the decrease for 2004 from 2003 was also offset by the effects of our adoption of sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 on july 1 2003 as a result of the adoption of sfas no 150 interest expense for 2004 and 2003 includes 100 million and 53 million respectively of dividends on a subsidiarys preferred stock which were classified as minority interest prior to the adoption of sfas no 150 

the increase in interest expense for 2003 from 2002 is due to our increased amount of debt outstanding in 2003 as a result of the broadband acquisition 

investment income loss net investment income loss net for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is comprised of the following dollars in millions 

 the investment impairment charges for 2003 and 2002 relate principally to other than temporary declines in our investment in att 

we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of most as of december 31 2004 of our investments accounted for as trading securities the differences between the unrealized gains losses on trading securities and the marktomarket adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities as presented in the table above result from one or more of the following 

• we did not maintain an economic hedge for our entire investment in the security during some portion or for all of the period • the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate • the issuing company paid a new or an increased dividend to the shareholders of the security or • the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period the marktomarket adjustments on derivatives and hedged items consist principally of the fair value adjustments related to the derivative component of the notes exchangeable into comcast stock we are exposed to changes in the fair value of this derivative since the underlying shares of comcast class a special common stock that we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and not adjusted for changes in fair value as of december 31 2004 approximately 84 million shares of comcast class a special common stock collateralize the outstanding comcast exchangeable notes 

equity in net losses of affiliates the increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2003 to 2004 results principally from the effects of our additional investments and changes in the net income or loss of our equity method investees 

other income the increase in other income from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the 250 million reduction in the estimated fair value liability associated with the att securities litigation recorded as part of the broadband acquisition and the 94 million gain recognized on the sale of our 20 interest in dhc ventures llc discovery health channel refer to notes 6 

and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of this settlement and this sale the increase in other income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to lease rental income related to certain assets acquired in the broadband acquisition 

income tax expense benefit the changes in income tax expense benefit are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income loss from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest 

minority interest the decrease in minority interest from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to the effects of our adoption of sfas no 150 on july 1 2003 upon which we now record our subsidiary preferred dividends previously included within minority interest to interest expense and to a lesser extent to increases in the net losses of some of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries the increase in minority interest from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to increases in the net income of our less than whollyowned consolidated subsidiaries and to dividends recorded to minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the broadband acquisition prior to the adoption of sfas no 150 on july 1 2003 

discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the 2003 periods including the results of qvc through august 31 while the 2002 period includes qvcs results for the full year as a result of the sale of qvc we recognized a 3290 billion gain net of approximately 2865 billion of related income taxes 

stock option accounting 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r which replaces sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123 and supercedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 with early adoption encouraged in addition sfas no 123r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in our third quarter of 2005 beginning july 1 2005 under sfas no 123r we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption the transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods under the retroactive methods prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 123r while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 123r and we expect that the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share we have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no 123r 

liquidity and capital resources 

during 2004 we continued to strengthen our balance sheet through the repayment and refinancing of debt and improved our liquidity through the sales or exchanges of our investments which are more fully described below we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and through our ability to obtain future external financing 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to 5930 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization the effects of interest and income tax payments proceeds from sales or exchanges of trading securities and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

during 2004 we made cash payments for interest totaling 1898 billion we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our cash paid for interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline but will remain significant during 2004 we made cash payments for income taxes totaling 205 million primarily as a result of state income taxes associated with our net income offsetting the cash payments were federal income tax refunds received during 2004 of approximately 591 million we anticipate that our income tax payments will increase as our income increases and certain tax audits are settled 

also contributing to the increase in our cash flow from operating activities was 680 million of proceeds received on the sale or exchange of our trading securities including 547 million received in connection with the liberty exchange transaction in july 2004 and 128 million received in connection with our sale of 3 million shares of liberty international common stock in december 2004 although the presentation of these proceeds within cash provided by operating activities is in accordance with 

generally accepted accounting principles these amounts are not indicative of our recurring operations but result from sales of investments 

during 2004 the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was 331 million the changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily a result of 515 million in cash payments for liabilities recorded associated with the broadband acquisition 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 2516 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 and consists principally of our net repayments of debt of 1293 billion and repurchases of common stock of 1324 billion during the year ended december 31 2004 our debt repayments and borrowings consisted of the following 

repayments 

• 867 million under senior and mediumterm notes • 700 million under revolving credit facilities • 609 million of comcast exchangeable debt and • 147 million under capital leases and other debt instruments borrowings 

• 700 million under revolving credit facilities • 320 million net under our commercial paper program and • 10 million under other debt instruments we have made and may from time to time in the future make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures depending on various factors such as market conditions 

commercial paper program in june 2004 we entered into a commercial paper program to provide a lowercost borrowing source of liquidity to fund our shortterm working capital requirements the program allows for a maximum of 225 billion of commercial paper to be issued at any one time our revolving bank credit facility supports this program as of december 31 2004 amounts outstanding under the program totaled 320 million with a weighted average interest rate of 268 

available borrowings under credit facilities we have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements in january 2004 we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new 45 billion fiveyear revolving bank credit facility due january 2009 the interest rate for borrowings under this revolver is libor plus 0625 based on our current credit ratings we have four lines of credit aggregating 4872 billion and as of december 31 2004 amounts available under our lines of credit totaled 4062 billion 

the crossguarantee structure we and a number of our whollyowned subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our cable assets have unconditionally guaranteed each others debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money including amounts outstanding under the 45 billion bank credit facility as of december 31 2004 20223 billion of our debt was included in the crossguarantee structure 

comcast holdings corporation our immediate predecessor and now a subsidiary is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the crossguarantee structure as of december 31 2004 950 million of our debt was outstanding at comcast holdings 

debt covenants we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital the two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage we have significant headroom under these financial covenants future compliance with these financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 

exchangeable notes we have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of cablevision class a common stock microsoft common stock vodafone adrs and comcast class a special common stock together the exchangeable notes at maturity the exchangeable notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into i a number of shares of common stock or adrs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio as defined or ii its cash equivalent the maturity value of 

the exchangeable notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed the exchangeable notes are collateralized by our investments in cablevision microsoft and vodafone respectively the comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our class a special common stock held in treasury we have settled and intend in the future to settle all of the comcast exchangeable notes using cash 

during 2004 and 2003 we settled an aggregate of 847 million face amount and 638 million face amount respectively of our obligations relating to our notes exchangeable into comcast stock by delivering cash to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying shares expired or were settled during 2004 and 2003 we settled 2359 billion face amount and 1213 billion face amount respectively of our obligations relating to our exchangeable notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the investments 

as of december 31 2004 our debt includes an aggregate of 1699 billion of exchangeable notes including 1645 billion within current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2004 the securities we hold collateralizing the exchangeable notes were sufficient to substantially satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding exchangeable notes 

stock repurchases during 2004 under our boardauthorized 2 billion share repurchase program we repurchased 469 million shares of our class a special common stock for 1328 billion we expect such repurchases to continue from time to time in the open market or in private transactions subject to market conditions 

refer to notes 8 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our financing activities 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 4512 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 and consists primarily of capital expenditures of 3660 billion additions to intangible and other noncurrent assets of 628 million and the acquisition of techtv for approximately 300 million 

capital expenditures our most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures the following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment during 2004 and expect to incur in 2005 dollars in millions 



the amount of our capital expenditures for 2005 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including competition changes in technology and the timing and rate of deployment of new services 

additions to intangibles additions to intangibles during 2004 primarily relate to our investment in a 250 million longterm strategic license agreement with gemstar multiple dwelling unit contracts of approximately 133 million and other licenses and software intangibles of approximately 168 million 

investments proceeds from sales settlements and restructurings of investments totaled 228 million during 2004 related to the sales of our nonstrategic investments including our 20 interest in dhc ventures llc discovery health channel for approximately 149 million we consider investments that we determine to be nonstrategic highlyvalued or both to be a source of liquidity we consider our investment in 15 billion in time warner commonequivalent preferred stock to be an anticipated source of liquidity 

we do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments 

refer to notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our investments and our intangible assets respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations 

our unconditional contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 which consist primarily of our debt obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods are summarized in the following table dollars in millions 

 refer to note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our longterm debt refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating lease and purchase obligations refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitionrelated obligations

our content subsidiaries enter into multiyear affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective programming in connection with these affiliation agreements we at times have paid a fee to the cable or satellite television operator for the initial or renewal agreement based upon the number of subscribers during 2005 we expect to incur fees of approximately 25 million related to these affiliation agreements excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates in order to manage the cost and volatility relating to our interest cost of our outstanding debt we maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments 

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant 

these derivative financial instruments which can include swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program during 2004 we decreased our interest expense by approximately 66 million through 

this program our derivative financial instruments did not have a significant effect on interest expense for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 however interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

the table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2004 dollars in millions 

 the notional amounts of interest rate instruments as presented in the table above are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the proceeds necessary to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december 31 2004 plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at december 31 2004 we estimate the floating rates on our swaps using the average implied forward libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december 31 2004 

excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments 58 of our total debt as of december 31 2004 was at variable rates compared to 82 at december 31 2003 

as a matter of practice we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investmentgrade credit ratings as of december 31 2004 the estimated fair value of the proceeds to be received related to those swaps was immaterial the amount due or to be received upon termination if any would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time 

equity price risk management 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of some of our investments accounted for as trading securities we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 

we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and through market value and sensitivity analyses maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

we use the following derivative financial instruments which we account for at fair value to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments accounted for as trading securities 

• cashless collar agreements equity collars • prepaid forward sales agreements prepaid forward sales • indexed debt instruments exchangeable notes except as described in results of continuing operations—investment income loss net on page 27 the changes in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity collars and the derivative components of the exchangeable notes and the prepaid forward sales

accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss primarily are unrealized losses on our rate locks offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities changes to these components account for the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004 refer to notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for more information about these components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss

description of our businesses 

cable 

we currently are the largest cable operator in the united states as of december 31 2003 our consolidated cable operations served 215 million subscribers in 35 states passed 398 million homes and provided digital cable to 77 million subscribers highspeed internet to 53 million subscribers and phone to 13 million subscribers 

the table below summarizes certain information for our cable systems as of december 31 homes and subscribers in millions 

          2 

  cable services 

we offer a variety of services over our cable networks including video highspeed internet and phone the greater the bandwidth the greater the informationcarrying capacity of the system over the past several years we have deployed fiber optic cable and digital compression technology and upgraded the technical quality of our cable networks as a result we have increased the reliability and capacity of our systems enabling us to deliver additional services such as digital cable highspeed internet and phone as of december 31 2003 approximately 95 of our cable systems are capable of handling twoway communications we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures during 2004 to complete the upgrade of the cable systems acquired in the broadband acquisition 

  video services 

we receive the majority of our revenues from subscription services subscribers typically pay us on a monthly basis and generally may discontinue services at any time monthly subscription rates and related charges vary according to the type of service selected and the type of equipment subscribers use 

we offer a full range of video services we tailor both our basic channel lineup and our additional channel offerings to each system according to demographics programming preferences and local regulation our video service offerings include the following 

  basic programming our basic cable service typically consists of between 1020 channels of programming this service generally consists of programming provided by national television networks local broadcast television stations locallyoriginated programming including governmental and public access and limited satellitedelivered programming 

  expanded basic programming our expanded basic cable service includes a group of satellitedelivered or nonbroadcast channels in addition to the basic channel lineup 

  premium services our premium services generally offer without commercial interruption feature motion pictures live and taped sporting events concerts and other special features 

  payperview programming our payperview service permits our subscribers to order for a separate fee individual feature motion pictures and special event programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts on an unedited commercialfree basis 

  digital cable  subscribers to our digital cable service receive one or more of the following 

         highspeed internet services 

residential subscribers can connect their personal computers via cable modems to access online information including the internet at faster speeds than that of conventional modems prior to march 2002 in areas our cable systems served we marketed highspeed internet services operated by a thirdparty internet service provider by march 2002 we had moved all of our highspeed internet subscribers to our own service in addition to offering our own highspeed internet service we have agreements with a number of thirdparty internet service providers or isps under which we make access to our facilities available and the isp markets a highspeed internet service that is provided over our cable systems 

  phone services 

in certain areas we provide to our subscribers traditional circuitswitched local telephone services a full array of associated features and thirdparty long distance services all under the brand “comcast digital phone” we are also beginning to launch voice over internet protocol “voip” a phone service delivered over our cable infrastructure involving voice transmissions using internet protocol on a limited commercial basis 

  advertising sales 

we generate revenues from the sale of advertising time to local regional and national advertisers on nonbroadcast networks we carry over our cable systems as part of our programming carriage agreements with these networks we receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time into which we insert commercials in any particular cable system market area we generally insert commercials into an average of 32 networks 

 3 

we also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in certain markets utilizing these arrangements we have formed and operate advertising interconnects which establish a physical direct link between multiple unaffiliated cable systems and provide for the insertion primarily of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas 

  other revenue sources 

we also generate revenues from installation services commissions from thirdparty electronic retailing and from other services such as providing businesses with internet connectivity and networked business applications 

  sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are primarily directed toward generating incremental revenues in our franchise areas and increasing the number of subscribers we serve we sell our products and services through 

        programming 

we generally acquire a license for the programming we sell to our subscribers by paying a monthly fee to the licensor on a per subscriber per channel basis our programming costs are increased by 

   we attempt to secure longterm programming contracts with volume discounts andor marketing support and incentives from programming suppliers our programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time and are subject to negotiated renewal we expect our programming costs to remain our largest single expense item for the foreseeable future in recent years the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a substantial increase in the cost of programming particularly sports programming we anticipate our programming costs will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased cost to produce and purchase programming and additional programming channels provided to our subscribers these increases are mitigated to some extent by additional volume discounts associated with our increased size and future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels the inability to pass these programming cost increases on to our subscribers would have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

we also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters to obtain the required consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers we cannot predict the impact of these negotiations or the effect on our subscribers should we be required to stop offering this programming 

  customer and technical service 

we service our customers through local regional and national call and technical centers generally our call centers provide 24hour per day 7day per week call answering capability telemarketing and other services our technical services function performs various tasks including cable installations transmission and distribution plant maintenance plant upgrades and other customer service related activities in 2003 we opened new call centers and expanded certain of our existing call centers to provide customer service and support to the cable systems acquired in the broadband acquisition 

  competition 

  video services 

our cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news information and entertainment programming to consumers including 

     4 

      in recent years congress has enacted legislation and the fcc has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable systems the fcc has recently created a new wireless service known as multichannel video distribution and data service or mvdds that we also expect to compete with our cable systems in order to compete effectively we strive to provide at a reasonable price to subscribers new products and services superior technical performance and customer service and a greater variety of video programming 

  dbs systems according to recent government and industry reports conventional medium and highpower satellites currently provide video programming to over 20 million customers in the united states dbs providers with highpower satellites typically offer to their subscribers more than 300 channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to those our cable systems provide two companies directv and echostar provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers 

dbs service can be received throughout the continental united states through a small roof top or sidemounted outside antenna dbs systems use video compression technology to increase channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals transmitted to their subscribers our digital cable service is competitive with the programming channel capacity and the digital quality of signals delivered to subscribers by dbs systems 

federal legislation establishes among other things a permanent compulsory copyright license that permits dbs systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who reside in the local television station’s market these companies are currently transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we currently serve additionally federal law generally provides dbs systems with access to all cableaffiliated video programming services delivered by satellite as a result satellite carriers are competitive to cable system operators like us because they offer programming that closely resembles what we offer these satellite carriers are attempting to expand their service offerings to include among other things highspeed internet service and are entering marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by local exchange carriers 

  smatv our cable systems also compete for subscribers with smatv systems smatv system operators typically are not subject to regulation like local franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellitedelivered programming services offered by franchised cable systems in addition some smatv operators are offering packages of telephony data and video services to private residential and commercial developments smatv system operators often enter into exclusive service agreements with building owners or homeowners’ associations although some states have enacted laws to provide cable systems access to these complexes 

  overbuilds we operate our cable systems pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise that is issued by the community’s governing body such as a city council a county board of supervisors or in some cases by a state regulatory agency federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems companies that traditionally have not provided cable services and that have substantial financial resources such as public utilities that own certain of the poles to which our cables are attached may also obtain cable franchises and may provide competing communications services these and other wireline communications systems offer cable and other communications services in various areas where we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will develop in other franchise areas that we serve 

  highspeed internet services 

most of our cable systems offer highspeed internet services within their service areas these systems compete with a number of other companies many of whom have substantial resources including 

    5 

the deployment of digital subscriber line or dsl technology allows internet access to be provided to subscribers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than that of conventional telephone modems numerous companies including telephone companies have introduced dsl service and certain telephone companies are seeking to provide highspeed internet services without regard to present service boundaries and other regulatory restrictions the fcc recently adopted an order that will reduce the obligations of local telephone companies to offer their broadband facilities on a wholesale basis to competitors and the fcc is considering further measures to deregulate the retail broadband offerings of local telephone companies as well congress may also consider measures to deregulate such broadband offerings 

a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we reached “access” agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps additionally in connection with the restructuring of time warner entertainment we entered into a threeyear nonexclusive access agreement with time warner under an agreement entered into in connection with the broadband acquisition we also agreed to offer to microsoft an access agreement on terms no less favorable than those provided to these and other isps with respect to specified cable systems we cannot provide any assurance however that regulatory authorities will not impose “open access” or similar requirements on us as part of an industrywide requirement these requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2003 a number of competitors offered substantial price discounts to subscribers willing to sign annual contracts or purchase additional bundled services we expect competition for highspeed internet service subscribers to remain intense with companies competing on service availability price transmission speed and bundled services 

  phone services 

our traditional circuitswitched local service competes against incumbent local exchange carriers cellular telephone service providers competitive local exchange carriers including established long distance companies and voip service providers many telecommunications carriers are expanding their offerings to include highspeed internet service such as dsl the incumbent local exchange carriers have substantial capital and other resources longstanding customer relationships extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few competitive local exchange carriers also have existing local networks and significant financial resources 

we expect advances in communications technology as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environments to occur in the future we refer you to page 7 for a detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory factors that may affect the telecommunications market other new technologies and services may develop and may compete with services that our cable systems offer consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments might have on our business and operations

content 

we have made investments in national cable television networks and other regional programmingrelated enterprises as a means of generating additional revenues and subscriber interest our consolidated programming investments as of december 31 2003 include approximate subscribers in millions 

    consolidated programming investments 

our programming investments are comprised of the following 

   our shareholder agreements with comcast spectacor and e entertainment contain certain exit rights processes with the minority shareholders refer to note 13 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of these exit rights processes 

  other programming interests we also own other noncontrolling interests in programming investments including in demand a payperview and videoondemand service tv one the discovery health channel fox sports new england new england cable news and pittsburgh cable news channel 

legislation and regulation 

our cable and phone businesses are subject to numerous regulatory requirements prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws local ordinances and our franchise agreements our content businesses are generally not subject to direct governmental regulation our highspeed internet business while not currently regulated may be subject to regulation in the future laws and regulations affect the prices we can charge for some services such as basic cable service and associated customerpremises equipment the costs we incur for example for attaching our wires to poles owned by utility companies the relationships we establish with our suppliers subscribers and competitors and many other aspects of our business 

 7 

the most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the communications act of 1934 as amended the provisions of the communications act and the manner in which the fcc state and local authorities and the courts implement and interpret those provisions affect our ability to develop and execute business plans our ability to raise capital and the competitive dynamics between and among different sectors of the communications and entertainment industries in which we operate the fcc also has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders and the imposition of other administrative sanctions such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate some of the transmission facilities we use in connection with our cable business 

we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by or under the communications act but caution that the precise requirements of the law are not always clear moreover many laws and regulations can be interpreted in afterthefact enforcement proceedings or private party litigation in a manner that is inconsistent with the judgments we have made we also note that regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing rules or prescribe new ones judicial decisions often alter the regulatory framework in ways that are inconsistent with regulator business and investor expectations in addition our cable business can be significantly affected by the enactment of new legislation congress seriously considers the enactment of new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year even though new laws infrequently result we always face the risk that congress will approve legislation significantly affecting the cable industry in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we are subject to new laws or regulations that do not equally affect our satellite wireline and wireless competitors 

a major objective of congress and the fcc is to increase competition in all communications services including those central to our business for example over the last ten years congress removed barriers to local telephone companies offering video services in their local service areas and the fcc has assigned spectrum licenses for mvdds a new wireless service for providing multichannel video programming the fcc has also paved the way for additional satellite competition and is currently pursuing efforts intended to enable utility power lines to be used to provide video and highspeed internet services our cable business could be affected by any new competitors that enter the video or highspeed internet businesses as a result of these and similar efforts by congress or the fcc in particular we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to these new competitors 

there are potential risks associated with various proceedings that are currently pending at the fcc in the courts and before federal and state legislatures and local franchise authorities we believe few of these proceedings hold the potential to materially affect our ability to conduct our cable business among the more substantial areas of exposure are the following 

  broadband acquisition  the fcc approved the broadband acquisition in november 2002 subject to various conditions the most significant were a requirement for the divestiture of our interest in time warner cable a requirement that the time warner cable interest be placed in trust pending divesture and safeguards that limit our involvement in time warner cable and the programmingrelated activities of the two partnerships held jointly by us and time warner cable complying with these conditions has limited and will continue to limit our flexibility as to the timing and nature of a sale of the time warner cable interest and in the interim will constrain our business dealings with time warner cable and time warner we have fully complied with these conditions and are committed to meeting our obligations under the fcc’s merger order goingforward 

  ownership limits  the fcc is considering imposing “horizontal ownership limits” that would limit the percentage of multichannel video subscribers – those that subscribe to cable dbs mmds and other multichannel distributors – that any single provider could serve nationwide a federal appellate court struck down the previous 30 limit and the fcc is now considering this issue anew as we already serve nearly 29 of multichannel video subscribers limits similar to those previously imposed would restrict our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities the fcc is also assessing whether it should reinstate “vertical ownership limits” on the number of affiliated programming services a cable operator may carry on its cable systems the previous limit of 40 of the first 75 channels had also been invalidated by the federal appellate court while our video programming interests are modest new vertical limits could affect our contentrelated business plans finally the fcc is considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules that would affect which cable subscribers are counted under any horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted for purposes of any vertical ownership limit 

  pricing  the communications act and the fcc’s regulations and policies limit the prices that cable systems may charge for basic services and equipment in communities that are not subject to effective competition as defined by federal law failure to comply with these

 8 

rate rules could result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers from time to time congress considers imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on the cable industry also the general accounting office occasionally issues reports regarding cable pricing or packaging issues we cannot now predict whether or when congress or any regulatory agency may adopt any new constraints on the pricing or packaging of cable services also various competitors are trying to persuade the fcc and the justice department to limit our ability to respond to increased competition by offering promotions or other discounts in an effort to retain existing subscribers or regain those we have lost we believe our competitive pricing practices are lawful and procompetitive if we cannot make individualized offers to subscribers who would otherwise choose a different provider our subscriber attrition may increase or our overall prices may need to be reduced or both 

  highspeed internet service  ever since highspeed internet service was introduced some local governments and various competitors have sought to impose regulatory requirements on how we deal with thirdparty isps thus far only a few local governments have imposed such requirements and the courts have invalidated all of them likewise the fcc has refused to treat our service as a common carrier “telecommunications service” but has instead classified it as an “interstate information service” which has historically meant that no regulations apply however the fcc’s decision recently was vacated by a panel of a federal appellate court the fcc has asked for a rehearing of the case by a larger panel of the appellate court but there is likely to be continuing uncertainty about how our highspeed internet service will ultimately be classified for regulatory purposes in addition even if the fcc’s decision is upheld the fcc will then renew its assessment of whether to impose any regulatory requirements on highspeed internet service and also whether local franchising authorities should be permitted to impose fees or other requirements such as service quality or customer service standards a few franchising authorities have sued us seeking payment of franchise fees on highspeed internet service revenues further a number of software and content providers and electronic retailers are now urging the fcc to adopt certain “nondiscrimination principles” that purport to be intended to allow internet customers access to the internet content of their choosing something we already provide we cannot now predict whether these or similar regulations will be adopted and if so what effects if any they would have on our business 

  internet regulation  congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation and obscenity and state and local governmental organizations have adopted internetrelated regulations as well these various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas such as pricing service and product quality and intellectual property ownership the adoption of new laws or the adaptation of existing laws to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our highspeed internet business recently congress enacted antispam legislation creating certain rights and obligations applicable to us as an isp and also imposing limitations on our ability to use electronic mail for the purpose of sending commercial messages to existing and potential customers the exact parameters of the law remain to be developed by regulations that are to be promulgated by the federal trade commission or ftc and the fcc in addition congress has not extended the moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access including access via highspeed internet service the fiveyear moratorium expired on november 1 2003 congress is still considering bills that would extend the moratorium but it is uncertain if and when such an extension might be adopted in the absence of the moratorium state and local governments might seek to impose new taxes on internet access which could adversely affect the operating results of our highspeed internet service 

  mustcarryretransmission consent  cable companies are currently subject to a requirement that they carry without compensation the programming transmitted by most commercial and noncommercial local television stations “mustcarry” alternatively local television stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for “retransmission consent” which may enable popular stations to demand significant concessions such as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks as a condition of our ability to transmit the tv broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive as broadcasters transition from analog to digital transmission technologies the fcc is considering whether to require cable companies to simultaneously carry both analog and digital signals of a single broadcaster it is also considering whether to allow broadcasters to choose mustcarry for either their analog or digital signals during this transition period additionally it is considering whether following the digital transition and the return of broadcaster analog spectrum to the government a cable company may be required to carry multiple digital programming streams that each broadcaster may include within its digital transmission if the fcc should adopt such mustcarry requirements we would have less freedom to allocate the usable spectrum of our cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to our subscribers this could diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers in addition mustcarry requirements may similarly reduce the freedom of other cable operators to allocate use of their cable plant this could adversely impact the ability of our cable networks 

 9 

to maintain or increase their carriage we cannot now predict whether the fcc will impose these or similar carriage obligations on us

  program access  the communications act and the fcc’s “program access” rules prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video distributors such as dbs and limit the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable operators the fcc has extended the exclusivity restrictions through october 2007 the fcc has concluded that the program access rules do not apply to programming services such as comcast sportsnet that are delivered terrestrially however the fcc has indicated that it may reconsider how it regulates cable operators with regional sports programming interests in its cable ownership rulemaking any decision by the fcc or congress to single out for new regulation cable operators like us who have regional sports programming interests could have an adverse impact on our cable and programming businesses some initiatives are underway to enact program accesstype regulations at the state or local level we believe any such regulations would be preempted by federal law or otherwise be unlawful but we cannot predict at this time whether such regulations will be enacted or found to be enforceable 

  consumer electronics equipment compatibility  the fcc has adopted rules to implement an agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of “plugandplay” tv sets that can connect directly to the cable network and receive oneway analog and digital cable services without the need for a settop box among other things the rules direct cable operators to implement technical standards in their networks to support these digital television sets require operators to provide a sufficient supply of conditional access devices to subscribers who want to receive scrambled programming services on their digital television sets and require operators to support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules for digital programming content these rules are being challenged at the fcc and in the courts and we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these challenges in addition the fcc has initiated rulemaking that will consider additional plugandplay regulations including standards for approving new digital connectors and copy protection technologies that cable operators would have to support it is uncertain when the fcc will complete this rulemaking and how it might affect cable operators also the cable and consumer electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would allow for the manufacture of twoway interactive plugandplay television sets once this agreement is finalized it will likely be subject to a separate fcc rulemaking it is unclear how this process will unfold and how it will ultimately affect our cable business and our efforts to sell cable services at retail outlets 

  phone service  our traditional circuitswitched phone business is subject to federal state and local regulation in general the communications act imposes interconnection requirements and universal service obligations on all telecommunications service providers including those that provide traditional circuitswitched phone service over cable facilities and more significant regulations on incumbent local exchange carriers such as verizon and sbc these traditional common carrier rules however are being reevaluated at the fcc and in congress for example the fcc has initiated several rulemakings that in the aggregate could significantly change the rules that apply to telephone competition including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers long distance and local providers and incumbents and new entrants and it is unclear how those proceedings and the litigation and implementation proceedings that are already underway as a product of one such rulemaking will affect our phone business we are beginning to launch voip on a limited commercial basis the fcc has initiated rulemaking to consider whether and how to regulate voip services voip services may also be subject to potential regulation at the state level and several states have attempted to impose traditional commoncarrier regulation on such services it is unclear how these voiprelated proceedings at the federal and state levels and the related judicial proceedings that will ensue might affect our planned voip service 

  franchise matters  cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction these franchises typically last for a fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality customer service and other requirements and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions the communications act includes provisions governing the franchising process including among other things renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal we anticipate that our future franchise renewal prospects generally will be favorable 

  leased accesspeg the communications act permits franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside channels for public educational and governmental access programming the communications act also requires a cable system with 36 or more activated channels to designate a significant portion of its channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered directly by the cable operator 

 10 

  state and local taxes  some states and their subdivisions are considering imposing new taxes including sales taxes on the services we offer we cannot predict at this time whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business 

  other regulatory issues  there are a number of other regulatory matters under review by congress the fcc and other federal agencies that could affect our cable business we briefly highlight these issues below 

          11 

  in all these areas and a variety of others we face the potential of increased regulation given the intensely competitive nature of every aspect of our business we believe that increased regulation is not warranted we can not provide any assurance however that regulation of our business will not increase 

employees 

as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 68000 employees of these employees approximately 59000 were associated with cable and approximately 9000 were associated with our other divisions approximately 3000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationships with our employees are good

the name of at home by certain at home bondholders against us brian l roberts cox and others alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the march 2000 transactions and seeking recovery of alleged shortswing profits of at least 600 million pursuant to section 16b of the securities exchange act of 1934 purported to have arisen in connection with certain transactions relating to at home stock effected pursuant to the march 2000 agreements and iv a lawsuit brought in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california by certain at home bondholders against comcast cable holdings llc and comcast cable communications holdings inc as well as att att credit holdings inc and att wireless services inc seeking to avoid and recover certain alleged “preference” payments in excess of 89 million allegedly made to the defendants prior to the at home bankruptcy filing the actions in san mateo county california have been stayed by the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california the court in which at home filed for bankruptcy as violating the automatic bankruptcy stay in the southern district of new york actions the court ordered the actions consolidated into a single action all of the defendants served motions to dismiss on february 11 2003 the court dismissed the common law claims against us and mr roberts leaving only a claim against them for “control person” liability under the securities exchange act of 1934 in a subsequent decision the court limited the remaining claim against us and mr roberts to disclosures that are alleged to have been made by at home prior to august 28 2000 the delaware case has been transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york and we have moved to dismiss the section 16b claims 

under the terms of the broadband acquisition we are generally contractually liable for 50 of any liabilities of att relating to at home including most liabilities resulting from any pending or threatened litigation with the exception among other things of liabilities arising out of contracts between at home and att or its affiliates for the benefit of the businesses retained by att following the divestiture of broadband in those situations where we are contractually liable for 50 of any liabilities att will be liable for the other 50 of these liabilities in addition to the actions against att described above where we are also a defendant there are two additional actions brought by at home’s bondholders’ liquidating trust against att not naming us i a lawsuit filed against att and certain of its senior officers in santa clara california state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action in connection with the transactions in march 2000 described above and prior and subsequent alleged conduct on the part of the defendants and ii an action filed against att in the district court for the northern district of california alleging that att infringes an at home patent by using its broadband distribution and highspeed internet backbone networks and equipment both of these actions are in the discovery stage 

we deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against us our subsidiaries and brian l roberts and intend to defend all of these claims vigorously in our opinion the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

we are currently waiting to obtain additional information and therefore are unable to determine what impact if any the final resolution of our share of these att at home potential liabilities would have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material 

  att 

we in connection with our acquisition of broadband are potentially responsible for a portion of the liabilities arising from two purported securities class action lawsuits brought against att and others and consolidated for pretrial purposes in the united states district court for the district of new jersey these lawsuits assert claims under section 11 section 12a2 and section 15 of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 10b and section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the first lawsuit for which our portion of the exposure is up to 15 alleges among other things that att made material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement and prospectus for the att wireless initial public offering the second lawsuit for which our portion of the exposure is up to 50 alleges among other things that att knowingly provided false projections relating to att common stock the complaints seek damages in an unspecified amount but because the trading activity during the purported class periods was extensive the amounts ultimately demanded may be significant we and att believe that att has meritorious defenses and these actions are being vigorously defended the parties are currently engaged in discovery and motions for summary judgment were filed in march 2004 

on june 24 1998 the first of a number of purported class action lawsuits was filed by thenshareholders of telecommunications inc “tci” series a tci group common stock “common a” against att and the 

 13 

directors of tci relating to the acquisition of tci by att a consolidated amended complaint combining the various different actions was filed on february 10 1999 in the delaware court of chancery the consolidated amended complaint alleges that former members of the tci board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to common a shareholders by agreeing to transaction terms whereby holders of the series b tci group common stock received a 10 premium over what common a shareholders received in connection with the transaction the complaint further alleges that att aided and abetted the tci directors’ breach 

in connection with the tci acquisition which was completed in early 1999 att agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify tci’s former directors for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities potentially including those incurred in connection with this action in connection with the broadband acquisition broadband agreed to indemnify att for certain losses expenses claims or liabilities those losses and expenses potentially include those incurred by att in connection with this action both as a defendant and in connection with any obligation that att may have to indemnify the former tci directors for liabilities incurred as a result of the claims against them in this action 

on september 8 1999 att moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action against att on july 7 2003 the delaware court of chancery granted att’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to adequately plead att’s “knowing participation” as required to state a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty the other claims made in the complaint remain outstanding discovery in this matter is now closed 

in our opinion the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  liberty digital 

on january 8 2003 liberty digital inc filed a complaint in colorado state court against us and comcast cable holdings llc the complaint alleges that comcast cable holdings breached a 1997 “contribution agreement” between liberty digital and comcast cable holdings and that we tortiously interfered with that agreement the complaint alleges that this purported agreement obligates comcast cable holdings to pay fees to liberty digital totaling 18 million increasing at cpi per year through 2017 liberty digital seeks among other things compensatory damages specific performance of the purported agreement a declaration that the agreement is valid and enforceable going forward and an unspecified amount of exemplary damages from us based on the alleged intentional interference claim we and comcast cable holdings filed our answer to the complaint on march 5 2003 in which we denied the essential allegations of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses 

on november 6 2003 liberty digital was granted leave to file an amended complaint that contained one minor revision to the original complaint on december 16 2003 we and comcast cable holdings filed our answer to the amended complaint in which we again denied the essential allegations of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses discovery in this matter is currently underway and a trial is scheduled to commence on may 31 2004 

in our opinion the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period further no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position 

  other 

we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business in our opinion the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

comcast is principally involved in the management and operation of cable communications networks and in the management of programming content over cable and satellite television networks in 2003 we received over 95 of our revenue from our cable operations primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video highspeed internet and phone services and advertising subscribers typically pay us monthly based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use revenue from our national television networks is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies 

highlights for the year 2003 included the following 

      the following provides the details of these highlights and insights into our company’s financial statements including critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements our liquidity and capital resources and a discussion of our results of operations 

business developments 

we have grown significantly in recent years through both strategic acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses on november 18 2002 we completed the acquisition of att corp‘s broadband business which we refer to as “broadband” the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure including a substantially higher amount of debt as a result direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to november 18 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful see “results of continuing operations” for a discussion of the effects of the broadband acquisition on our results of operations 

on september 17 2003 we completed the sale to liberty media corporation of our approximate 57 interest in qvc inc for approximately 77 billion we received from liberty 40 billion of threeyear senior unsecured floating rate notes approximately 218 million shares of liberty series a common stock valued at 2339 billion and cash of 135 billion qvc has been presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for more information on the sale of qvc 

refer to “general developments of our business” in part i and note 5 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the impairment testing and valuation of our cable franchise rights and the valuation of acquisition related assets liabilities and legal contingencies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below 

  impairment testing and valuation of cable franchise rights 

our cable systems are constructed and operated under nonexclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time as of december 31 2003 we served approximately 4400 franchise areas in the united states we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows accordingly our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

 19 

we have acquired these franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories upon acquisition we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions we control the sourcing of content pricing marketing and branding and capital deployment throughout the company as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset therefore we have concluded the franchise rights are operated as a single asset within our cable segment from time to time however the franchise rights are separated and sold in units below the cable segment level we have concluded that emerging issues task force 0207 “unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets” supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets both are operated together and are essentially inseparable during 2002 and 2003 we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level effective in the first quarter of 2004 we will change the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions and will perform impairment testing on our cable franchise rights we do not anticipate recording any impairment charge in connection with the impairment testing 

we assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets discounted cash flow analyses analyses of current market transactions and profitability information including estimated future operating results trends or other determinants of fair value if the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge 

the carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions conversely the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 142 nevertheless testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights

as more fully described in note 5 to our financial statements included in item 8 see acquisition of broadband  the fair value of the shares issued for broadband was based on the date the nonequity or “other” consideration being paid was substantively changed from the terms of the original merger agreement the fair value of the shares issued for broadband based on the new measurement date was approximately onehalf the fair value of the shares as of the date of the original merger agreement accordingly the effect of the modification was to reduce by approximately onehalf approximately 23 billion the value assigned to the equity consideration issued in connection with the broadband acquisition the reduction in the fair value of the equity consideration reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our goodwill 

  fair value of acquisition related assets liabilities and legal contingencies 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values in determining fair value management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts to assist in this process third party valuation specialists are engaged to value certain of these assets and liabilities 

estimates used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities include but are not limited to expected future cash flows market rate assumptions for contractual obligations actuarial assumptions for benefit plans settlement plans for litigation and contingencies and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain in addition estimated liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees are subject to change as we complete the implementation of the plan 

the assets and assumed liabilities related to the broadband acquisition that required significant judgment in estimating fair value included investments cable franchise rights franchise related customer relationships assumed contractual and other obligations and costs related to terminating certain of broadband’s contractual obligations and employees in addition we are party to certain legal contingencies including those described in item 3 legal proceedings if based on information available a potential loss arising from the lawsuits claims and actions involving att or broadband was deemed 

 20 

probable and reasonably estimable or the fair value of the contingency could be determined we recorded the liability in the purchase price allocation for certain other cases we are awaiting additional information to determine if a liability should be recorded in addition the inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses

significant and subjective estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities such as income taxes and litigation we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

refer to note 2 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 

liquidity and capital resources 

during 2003 we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and increased our liquidity through the repayment and refinancing of debt and through the sales or restructurings of certain of our investments which are more fully described below see financing on page 23 

anticipated sources of liquidity 

we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity and capital requirements including fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities existing cash cash equivalents and investments through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and through our ability to obtain future external financing 

  cash and cash equivalents 

we have traditionally maintained significant levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2003 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 155 billion substantially all of which is unrestricted 

  investments 

investments that we determine to be nonstrategic highlyvalued or both are considered by us to be a source of liquidity as of december 31 2003 we consider our investments in the following to be potential sources of liquidity 

    we do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments 

refer to note 6 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our investments 

  available borrowings under credit facilities 

we have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements as of december 31 2003 amounts available under our lines of credit totaled 5876 billion 

on january 8 2004 we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new 45 billion fiveyear revolving bank credit facility due january 2009 as of january 8 2004 remaining amounts available under our lines of credit totaled 4381 billion see debt covenants on page 24 

anticipated uses of cash 

  capital expenditures 

our most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures during 2004 however we expect cable capital expenditures to decline compared to 2003 as we complete the upgrade of our cable systems 

we expect to incur approximately 34 billion of capital expenditures in our cable and content businesses substantially all of which will be in our cable business as of december 31 2003 we do not have any significant contractual obligations for capital expenditures the amount of our capital expenditures for 2004 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

    21 

the following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable business during 2003 and expect to incur in 2004 in millions 

   interest 

during 2003 we made cash payments for interest totaling 2053 billion we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our cash paid interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline but will remain significant 

  income taxes 

during 2003 we made cash payments for income taxes totaling 945 million primarily as a result of our sale of qvc and certain of our other investments we anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will be significantly reduced in 2004 

  stock repurchases 

in december 2003 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of our outstanding common equity securities we expect such repurchases to occur from time to time in the open market or in private transactions subject to market conditions 

  affiliation agreements 

certain of our content subsidiaries enter into multiyear affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective programming in connection with these affiliation agreements we generally pay a launch fee to the cable or satellite television operator based upon the number of subscribers during 2004 we expect to incur fees of no more than 150 million related to these affiliation agreements excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems 

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  contractual obligations 

our unconditional contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 which consist primarily of our debt obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods are summarized in the table below 

refer to note 8 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our longterm debt refer to note 13 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our operating lease and purchase obligations refer to note 5 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitionrelated obligations 

 22 

       financing 

as of december 31 2003 and 2002 our debt including capital lease obligations was 26996 billion and 34909 billion respectively the 7913 billion decrease from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 results from our net debt repayments and noncash financing transactions during 2003 included in our debt as of december 31 2003 and 2002 was shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt of 3161 billion and 6953 billion respectively 

we have and may from time to time in the future depending on certain factors including market conditions make optional repayments on our debt obligations which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures 

refer to notes 8 and 10 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our financing activities 

the following table illustrates the sources of cash received from our significant investing and financing activities during 2003 the majority of these proceeds were used to repay or refinance a portion of our outstanding debt and other obligations 

 23 

   the crossguarantee structure 

to simplify our capital structure we and a number of our whollyowned subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our cable communications assets have unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money including amounts outstanding under the new credit facilities as of december 31 2003 20866 billion of our debt was included in the crossguarantee structure 

comcast holdings is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the crossguarantee structure as of december 31 2003 1024 billion of our debt was outstanding at comcast holdings 

  debt covenants 

we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital the two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage we have significant headroom under these financial covenants the entire amount of our new 45 billion bank credit facility is currently available for our use and future compliance with our financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 

  exchangeable notes 

we have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of cablevision ny group “cablevision” class a common stock microsoft corporation “microsoft” common stock vodafone adrs and comcast class a special common stock together the “exchangeable notes” at maturity the exchangeable notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into i a number of shares of common stock or adrs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio as defined or ii its cash equivalent the maturity value of the exchangeable notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed the exchangeable notes are collateralized by our investments in cablevision microsoft and vodafone respectively 

the comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our class a special common stock held in treasury we have and intend in the future to settle the comcast exchangeable notes using cash 

during 2003 we settled 1851 billion of our obligations relating to certain of our exchangeable notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock or cash to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying shares expired or were settled 

as of december 31 2003 our debt includes an aggregate of 4318 billion of exchangeable notes including 2427 billion and 1891 billion within current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt respectively as of december 31 2003 the securities held by us collateralizing the exchangeable notes were 

 24 

sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding exchangeable notes

  interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates we maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 

we monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments 

we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses if any to be significant 

we use the following derivative financial instruments to manage the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates 

    while swaps rate locks caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program their effect on interest expense for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 was not significant however swaps rate locks caps and collars may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future 

the table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of december 31 2003 dollars in millions 

 the notional amounts of interest rate instruments as presented in the table above are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss the estimated fair value approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding contracts we estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward london interbank offer rate “libor” rates for the year of maturity based 

 25 

on the yield curve in effect at december 31 2003 plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at december 31 2003 we estimate the floating rates on our swaps using the average implied forward libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december 31 2003 

excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments 82 of our total debt as of december 31 2003 was at variable rates compared to 318 at december 31 2002 the decrease from december 31 2002 in the percentage of our variable rate debt was due to the repayment of substantially all of our variable rate bank debt during 2003 

as a matter of practice we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratingsbased triggers that could affect our liquidity in the ordinary course of business certain of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investmentgrade credit ratings as of december 31 2003 the fair value of the liability related to those swaps was approximately 19 million the amount due upon termination if any would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time

  equity price risk management 

we are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures 

we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities reduce our risks relating to equity prices and through market value and sensitivity analyses maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item 

we use the following derivative financial instruments which we account for at fair value to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities 

   except as described in results of continuing operations — investment income loss net on page 31  the changes in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity collars and the derivative components of the exchangeable notes and the prepaid forward sales 

refer to note 2 to our financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to derivative financial instruments and to notes 6 and 8 to our financial statements included in item 8 for discussions of our derivative financial instruments 

  accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss primarily are unrealized losses on our rate locks offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities changes to these components account for the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 refer to notes 6 and 8 to our financial statements included in item 8 for more information about these components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

statement of cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 1045 billion as of december 31 2003 from december 31 2002 the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows from operating financing and investing activities as explained below 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to 2854 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization see “results of continuing operations”  the effects of interest and income tax payments and changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 7048 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 during 2003 we borrowed 9398 billion consisting principally of 

   during 2003 we repaid 16465 billion of our debt consisting principally of 

  26 

     net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 5239 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 during 2003 proceeds from investing activities include sales settlements and restructuring of investments as listed in the table under financing on page 24 offset in part by capital expenditures of 4161 billion 

results of continuing operations 

revenues 

consolidated revenues for the years 2003 and 2002 increased 102 billion and 22 billion respectively from the previous year of these increases 101 billion and 20 billion respectively relate to our cable segment which is discussed separately below the remaining increases are primarily the result of our content businesses which achieved combined revenue growth of 154 and 265 during the years 2003 and 2002 respectively such increases in the content businesses were primarily the result of increases in distribution revenues increases in advertising revenues and the effects of our 2001 acquisitions 

operating selling general and administrative expenses 

consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses for the years 2003 and 2002 increased 67 billion and 13 billion respectively from the previous year of these increases 66 billion and 13 billion respectively relate to our cable segment which is discussed separately below the remaining increases are primarily the result of growth in our content businesses and increases in corporate overhead 

depreciation 

the increases in depreciation expense for the years 2003 and 2002 are primarily attributable to our cable segment the increases in our cable segment are principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition as well as our increased levels of capital expenditures 

amortization 

the increase in amortization expense for the year 2003 is primarily attributable to our cable segment the increase in our cable segment is principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition as a result of the broadband acquisition we recorded approximately 34 billion of franchiserelated customer relationship intangible assets which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years 

the decrease in amortization expense for the year 2002 is primarily attributable to our cable segment principally due to the effects of the adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002 as we no longer amortize goodwill or franchise rights intangible assets this decrease is partially offset by the effects of the broadband acquisition 

cable segment operating results 

the discussion of our cable segment historical operating results is presented as a comparison of the 2003 2002 and 2001 periods which only include the broadband results subsequent to november 18 2002 in order to provide additional information relating to our cable segment operating results we also present a comparison of 2003 actual results to 2002 results on a pro forma basis management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses in the opinion of management this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated broadband since january 1 2002 nor of our future results amounts in millions

 27 

2003 to 2002 pro forma comparisons 

our 2003 cable operating results reflect revenue growth of 91 and operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of 421 compared to the pro forma 2002 year the growth in revenue is primarily the result of growth in basic digital cable and highspeed internet subscribers and rate increases the increase in highspeed internet subscribers reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable internet service provided over our cable networks the increase in our video subscribers was driven by an increase of approximately 117000 subscribers in 2003 in the broadband systems that reversed a loss of approximately 483000 subscribers in 2002 the growth in digital cable subscribers reflects increased demand for additional programming choices and enhancements in digital service packages rate increases occurred in our traditional video service as well as from the repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel products in the broadband systems 

the 2003 operating income before depreciation and amortization results reflect the significant operating trends and efficiencies achieved in integrating the broadband operations the integration of broadband involved changing the organizational structure and refocusing priorities including 

       28 

   revenues 

video revenue consists of our basic expanded basic premium payperview equipment and digital cable services the increase in video revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service growth in digital subscribers and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the broadband systems from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 we added approximately 140000 basic subscribers and over 10 million digital subscribers or a 156 increase in digital subscribers we expect continued growth in our video services revenue 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the addition in 2003 of approximately 17 million highspeed internet subscribers or a 459 increase in highspeed internet subscribers as well as to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber we expect continued revenue growth as overall demand for our services continues to increase 

the decrease in phone revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily as a result of our focus on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business rather than focusing on subscriber growth as a result during 2003 our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 171000 subscribers 

the increase in advertising sales revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regionalnational advertising as a result of the continuing success of our regional interconnects offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market 

other revenue includes installation revenues guide revenues commissions from electronic retailing revenue from our regional sports programming networks and reduced revenue from other product offerings 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 

  expenses 

total expenses decreased 427 million or 37 in 2003 from 2002 which is primarily the result of the effects of approximately 425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by broadband in 2002 excluding the effects of these costs total expenses were nearly level with the 2002 amounts this is a result of cost efficiencies generated from the integration of broadband 

programming costs represent our single largest operating expense and represent fees paid to license programming from cable and broadcast networks that we distribute package and sell to our video subscribers programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates the number of subscribers and programming channels in 2003 programming costs increased 23 as compared to 2002 during 2003 we were able to negotiate reductions in programming rates primarily in premium channels we anticipate our programming costs will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased cost to produce and purchase programming and additional programming channels provided to our subscribers these increases are mitigated to some extent by additional volume discounts associated with our increased size and future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels 

other operating selling and general and administrative expenses decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the effects of approximately 425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by broadband in 2002 additionally in 2003 customer service expenses slightly declined because we no longer outsource broadband’s customer service operations we also reduced administrative and overhead expenses through reductions in headcount and the elimination of redundancies offsetting these decreases were increases in labor and other volume related operating expenses associated with the growth in our highspeed internet and digital cable services

  2003 to 2002 historical comparisons 

  a refer to footnote a on page 28 

video revenue increased 6580 billion from 2002 to 2003 of which 6286 billion is attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition and 294 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations driven principally by growth in our digital subscribers during 2003 we added over 10 million digital subscribers 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the broadband acquisition and growth in highspeed internet subscribers during 2003 we added approximately 17 million highspeed internet subscribers 

the increase in phone advertising sales and other revenue is principally attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition our historical operations prior to the broadband acquisition did not contain significant phone revenue 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply 

the increase in operating selling general and administrative expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the broadband acquisition as well as to the effects of an increase in the costs of cable programming an increase in labor costs and other volumerelated expenses in our historical operations and to a lesser extent to the effect of highspeed internet subscriber growth 

2002 to 2001 historical comparisons

video revenues increased 1238 billion from 2001 to 2002 of which 945 million is attributable to the effects of our acquisitions of cable systems and 293 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations driven principally by growth in digital subscribers during 2002 we added approximately 44 million digital subscribers as a result of the broadband acquisition and we added approximately 05 million digital subscribers through growth in our historical operations 

the increase in highspeed internet revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to the addition of highspeed internet subscribers during 2002 we added approximately 21 million highspeed internet subscribers as a result of the broadband acquisition and we added approximately 06 million highspeed internet subscribers through growth in our historical operations 

the increase in advertising sales revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the effects of the broadband acquisition as well as to the effects of a stronger advertising market and the continued success of our regional interconnects 

the increase from 2001 to 2002 in other revenue is primarily attributable to other product revenues including phone revenue as a result of the broadband acquisition the remaining increase from 2001 to 2002 is attributable to growth in our historical operations 

the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to the increases in our revenues upon which the fees apply

on september 28 2001 at home corporation “at home” our former provider of highspeed internet services filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in october 2001 we amended our agreement with at home to continue service to our existing and new subscribers during october and november 2001 we agreed to be charged a higher rate than we had incurred under our previous agreement on december 3 2001 we reached a definitive agreement approved by the bankruptcy court with at home pursuant to which at home agreed to continue to provide highspeed internet services to our existing and new subscribers through february 28 2002 in december 2001 we began to transfer our highspeed internet subscribers from the at home network to our new comcastowned and managed network we completed this transition in february 2002 operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2001 include 140 million of net incremental expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001 in the continuation of service to and transition of our highspeed internet subscribers from at home’s network to our network 

consolidated other income expense items 

  interest expense 

the increases in interest expense for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 from the previous year are due to our increased amount of debt outstanding as a result of the broadband acquisition 

  investment income loss net 

investment income loss net for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 includes the following in millions 

  31 

we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities investment income loss net includes the fair value adjustments related to our trading securities and derivative financial instruments the change in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities with the exception in 2003 of the unrealized gain on 118 million shares of our liberty common shares discussed below was substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives 

beginning in 2003 we are exposed to changes in the fair value of 118 million shares of liberty common stock we hold and account for as a trading security as we have not entered into a corresponding derivative to hedge this market exposure 

we are also exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the comcast exchangeable notes we have outstanding since the underlying 309 million shares of comcast class a special common stock we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and are not adjusted for changes in fair value 

accordingly our future results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of both the liberty common stock and the derivative component of the comcast exchangeable notes in future periods 

gains losses on sales and exchanges of investments net in 2001 relates principally to our investment in at home 

the investment impairment losses relate principally to other than temporary declines in our investment in att 

in connection with the reclassification of our investment in sprint pcs from an available for sale security to a trading security upon the adoption of sfas no 133 on january 1 2001 we reclassified to investment income loss net the accumulated unrealized gain of 1092 billion on our investment in sprint pcs that was previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  equity in net losses of affiliates 

equity in net losses of affiliates for 2003 results principally from the fullyear impact of losses of investees we acquired in the broadband acquisition 

the increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to an other than temporary decline in certain of our equity method investees the effects of our additional investments a change in the net income or loss of our equity method investees as well as to the effects of the discontinuance of amortization of equity method goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002 

  other income 

the increase in other income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to lease rental income related to certain assets acquired in the broadband acquisition 

on october 30 2001 we acquired from fox entertainment group inc “fox entertainment” the approximate 832 interest in outdoor life network “oln” not previously owned by us upon closing of the acquisition we exchanged our 145 interest in speedvision network “svn” together with a previously made loan for fox entertainment’s interest in oln in connection with the exchange of our interest in svn we recorded a pretax gain of 107 million representing the difference between the estimated fair value of our interest in svn as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in svn 

on january 1 2001 we completed our cable systems exchange with adelphia communications corporation “adelphia” we received cable systems serving approximately 445000 subscribers from adelphia and adelphia received certain of our cable systems serving approximately 441000 subscribers we recorded a pretax gain of 1199 billion representing the difference between the estimated fair value of 1799 billion as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged 

  income tax benefit expense 

the changes in income tax benefit expense are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income before taxes and minority interest and nondeductible goodwill amortization in 2001 

  minority interest 

the increases in minority interest are attributable to increases in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as in 2003 to dividends recorded to minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the broadband acquisition prior to the adoption of sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” 

 32 

  discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the 2003 period including qvc’s results through august 31 while the 2002 period includes qvc’s results for the full year as a result of the sale of qvc we recognized a 3290 billion gain net of approximately 2865 billion of related income taxes 

income from discontinued operations decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily as a result of an investment loss recognized by qvc during 2002 

  cumulative effect of accounting change 

upon adoption of sfas no 133 we recognized as income a cumulative effect of accounting change net of related income taxes of 385 million during the year ended december 31 2001 the income consisted of a 400 million adjustment to record the debt component of our 20 exchangeable subordinated debentures due 2029 at a discount from its value at maturity and 192 million principally related to the reclassification of gains previously recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our equity derivative instruments net of related deferred income taxes of 207 million 

we believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation

1   on november  18 2002  we  consummated  the  broadband  acquisition  for
      information as of december 31 2002 we provide data with respect to cable
      systems  attributable to comcast holdings  corporation  formerly  comcast
      corporation  and  now our  wholly  owned  subsidiary  under  the  heading
      historical  and data  with  respect  to cable  systems  attributable  to
      broadband  under the heading newly  acquired the broadband  acquisition
      substantially  increased  the  size of our  cable  operations  and  direct
      comparisons  of our cable  information  for periods  prior to november 18
      2002 to  subsequent  periods are not  meaningful  the  information  as of
      december 31 2002 excludes the operating  statistics for the cable systems
      held for sale to bresnan

      inc in january 2000 we acquired lenfest  communications  inc and began
      consolidating the results of comcast  cablevision of garden state lp in
      august 2000 we acquired  prime  communications  llc on december 31 2000
      and january 1 2001 we completed our cable  systems  exchanges  with att
      and  adelphia  communications  respectively  in april and june 2001  we
      acquired  cable  systems  serving an  aggregate of  approximately  697000
      subscribers from att the subscriber  information as of december 31 2000
      excludes the effects of our exchange with att

      further extending the transmission lines as described in note 4 below in
      the case of certain  multiple  dwelling units or mdus homes passed are
      counted on an adjusted basis

      connected  to a system  counts  as one  cable  subscriber  in the case of
      certain mdus we count cable subscribers on an fcc equivalent basis
5   a subscriber is digital  ready if the subscriber is in a market where we
      have launched our digital cable  service
6   a dwelling with one or more digital  converter boxes counts as one digital
      cable subscriber  on average as of december 31 2002 each digital cable
      subscriber had 14 digital settop boxes
7   a home is  available  if we can  connect it to our  distribution  system
      without further upgrading the transmission  lines and we offer the service
      in that area

      and subscribers was not material



     cable services

     we  offer  a  variety  of  services  over  our  cable  networks  including
traditional analog video digital cable  highspeed internet and phone service
available  service  offerings  depend  on the  bandwidth  capacity  of the cable
system the greater the bandwidth the greater the information carrying capacity
of the system prior to the broadband acquisition  86 of our cable subscribers
were  served by a system  with a  capacity  of at least  750mhz  and 95 with a
capacity of at least 550mhz and capable of handling twoway communications  as
of december 31 2002  approximately 82 of our cable subscribers were served by
a system  with a capacity of at least  550mhz  and capable of handling  twoway
communications we expect to make substantial capital expenditures over the next
two years to  complete  the  rebuild  and  upgrade of the newly  acquired  cable
systems  by deploying fiber optic cable and upgrading the technical  quality of
our cable networks  we can increase

the reliability and capacity of our systems and we can deliver  additional video
programming  and other  services  such as  enhanced  digital  video  highspeed
internet and phone

     traditional analog video services

     we  receive  the  majority  of our  revenues  from  subscription  services
subscribers  typically pay us on a monthly  basis and generally may  discontinue
services  at any time  monthly  subscription  rates and  related  charges  vary
according  to the type of service  selected  and the type of  equipment  used by
subscribers

     we offer a full range of traditional analog video services  we tailor both
our basic channel  lineup and our additional  channel  offerings to each system
according to demographics  programming  preferences and local  regulation  our
analog service offerings include the following

     basic  programming  our basic cable service typically  consists of between
1020 channels of programming  this service  generally  consists of programming
provided by national television  networks  local broadcast television stations
locallyoriginated  programming  including  governmental and public access and
limited satellitedelivered programming

     expanded basic  programming  our expanded  basic cable service  which may
vary in size depending on the systems channel  capacity  generally  includes a
group of  satellitedelivered or nonbroadcast channels in addition to the basic
channel lineup

     premium services  our premium services generally offer without commercial
interruption  feature motion pictures live and taped sporting events concerts
and other special  features  the charge for premium  services  depends upon the
type and number of premium channels selected by the subscriber

     payperview programming  our payperview service permits our subscribers
to order  for a separate fee  individual  feature motion  pictures and special
event programs such as professional boxing professional wrestling and concerts
on an unedited commercialfree basis

     digital cable services

     digital  compression  technology  enables us to substantially  increase the
number of channels our cable systems can carry  thereby providing a significant
number of additional programming choices to our subscribers digital compression
technology  can convert up to twelve  analog  signals into a digital  format and
compress  these  signals  into the  bandwidth  normally  occupied  by one analog
signal  at the home a settop video terminal  often referred to as a digital
settop box converts the digital signal into analog signals that can be viewed
on a television set

     subscribers  typically pay us on a monthly basis for digital cable services
and generally may discontinue services at any time monthly rates vary generally
according  to the level of  service  and the  number of  digital  settop  boxes
selected by the subscriber

     subscribers  to our  digital  cable  service  receive  one or  more  of the
following

      o     an interactive program guide

      o     multiple channels of digital music

      o     basic and expanded basic programming

      o     multiplexes  of  premium  channels  which are varied as to time of
            broadcast or programming content theme

      o     additional  payperview  programming  such  as  more  payperview
            options andor frequent showings of the most popular films

      o     videoondemand  service  commonly known as vod  including popular
            television programs at no additional charge and

      o     highdefinition television

     we have and will  continue to upgrade our cable systems so that we are able
to provide  these and other new services such as  interactive  television to our
subscribers

     highspeed internet services

     residential  subscribers  can connect  their  personal  computers via cable
modems to access online  information  including the internet  at faster speeds
than that of  conventional  modems  prior to march 2002 in areas served by our
cable  systems  we  marketed  high  speed  internet   services  operated  by  a
thirdparty  internet service  provider  by march 2002 we had moved all of our
highspeed  internet  subscribers  to our own high speed internet  gateway  in
addition to offering our own highspeed  internet  service  we have  agreements
with a number of thirdparty internet service providers or isps under which we
make  available  access  to our  facilities  and the isp  markets  a  highspeed
internet  service  that is  provided  over our cable  systems  we also  provide
businesses  with  internet   connectivity   solutions  and  networked   business
applications

     phone services

     in some of the areas where cable plant has been upgraded  we use our cable
network to provide  local  telephone  services  and to resell  thirdparty  long
distance services to our phone subscribers we currently offer phone services to
subscribers in 15 markets

     advertising sales

     we generate  revenues from the sale of advertising time to local  regional
and  national  advertisers  on non  broadcast  channels we carry over our cable
systems

     other revenue sources

     we also generate  revenues from  installation  services  commissions  from
thirdparty electronic retailing and from other services

     sales and marketing

     our sales  efforts are primarily  directed  toward  generating  incremental
revenues in our franchise  areas and  increasing  the number of  subscribers  we
serve we sell our products and services through

      o     telemarketing

      o     direct mail advertising

      o     doortodoor selling

      o     cable television advertising

      o     local media advertising and

      o     retail outlets

     programming

     we  generally  acquire  a  license  for  the  programming  we  sell  to our
subscribers  by paying a monthly  fee to the  licensor on a per  subscriber  per
channel basis our programming costs are increased by

      o     growth in the number of subscribers

      o     expansion of the number of channels provided to subscribers and

      o     increases in contract rates from programming suppliers

     we attempt to secure longterm  programming contracts with volume discounts
andor  marketing  support  and  incentives  from  programming  suppliers   our
programming  contracts  are generally for a fixed period of time and are subject
to negotiated  renewal  we expect our  programming  costs to remain our largest
single expense item for the foreseeable  future  in recent years the cable and
satellite video industries have  experienced a substantial  increase in the cost
of  programming  particularly  sports  programming  we expect this increase to
continue  and we may not be able to pass  programming  cost increases on to our
subscribers  the inability to pass these  programming  cost increases on to our
subscribers  would have a material adverse impact on our operating  results  in
addition  as we upgrade the channel capacity of our systems and add programming
to our  basic  expanded  basic  and  digital  programming  tiers  we may  face
increased programming costs

     we also expect to be subject to  increasing  financial and other demands by
broadcasters to obtain the required consent for the  retransmission of broadcast
programming to our subscribers  we cannot predict the financial impact of these
negotiations  or the effect on our  subscribers  should we be  required  to stop
offering this programming

     customer service

     we have  organized  most of our cable  systems  into  geographic  clusters
clustering  improves  our ability to sell  advertising  enhances our ability to
efficiently introduce and market new products and allows us to more efficiently
and effectively  provide customer service and support as part of our clustering
strategy  we have  consolidated  our local customer  service  operations of our
historical  operations  into large  regional call centers  these  regional call
centers have technologically advanced telephone systems that provide 24hour per
day 7day per week call answering capability telemarketing and other services
in 2003  we anticipate  opening new call centers and  expanding  certain of our
existing  call  centers to provide  customer  service  and  support to the newly
acquired cable systems

     competition

     analog video and digital cable services

     our cable systems compete with a number of different  sources which provide
news information and entertainment programming to consumers including

      o     program  distributors that use direct broadcast  satellite  or dbs
            systems   that   transmit   satellite   signals   containing   video
            programming  data and  other  information  to  receiving  dishes of
            varying sizes located on the subscribers premises

      o     local television broadcast stations that provide offair programming
            which can be received using an antenna and a television set

      o     satellite  master  antenna  television  systems  commonly  known as
            smatvs  which  generally

                                       6 


page

            serve  condominiums  apartment and office complexes and residential
            developments

      o     other  operators  who  build  and  operate  wireline  communications
            systems  in the same  communities  that we  serve  including  those
            operating as franchised  cable  operations  or under an  alternative
            regulatory scheme known as open video systems or ovs

      o     interactive   online   computer    services    including   internet
            distribution of movies

      o     newspapers magazines and book stores

      o     movie theaters

      o     live concerts and sporting events and

      o     video stores and home video products

     in recent years  congress has enacted  legislation and the fcc has adopted
regulatory  policies intended to provide a favorable  operating  environment for
existing  competitors  and for potential new  competitors  to our cable systems
these competitors include dbs wireline communications  providers also known as
overbuilders  smatvs and multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds
the fcc has recently created a new wireless service known as multichannel video
distribution and data service or mvdds that we also expect to compete with our
cable  systems  in order to compete  effectively  our cable systems  strive to
provide  at a reasonable  price to  subscribers  new  products  and  services
superior technical performance  superior customer service and a greater variety
of video programming

     dbs  systems   according  to  recent   government  and  industry  reports
conventional   medium  and  highpower   satellites   currently  provide  video
programming  to over 20 million  customers in the united  states  dbs providers
with highpower  satellites  typically offer to their  subscribers more than 300
channels of programming including programming services substantially similar to
those  provided by our cable  systems  two  companies  directv  and  echostar
provide service to substantially all of these dbs subscribers

     dbs  service can be  received  throughout  the  continental  united  states
through  the  installation  of a small  roof top or  sidemounted  antenna  dbs
systems use video  compression  technology  to  increase  channel  capacity  and
digital   technology  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  signals
transmitted to their subscribers  our digital cable service is competitive with
the programming  channel capacity and the digital quality of signals  delivered
to subscribers by dbs systems

     federal legislation establishes among other things a permanent compulsory
copyright license that permits satellite  carriers to retransmit local broadcast
television  signals to subscribers who reside in the local television  stations
market these companies are transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets
which we serve as a result  satellite carriers are competitive to cable system
operators like us because they offer programming which closely resembles what we
offer these satellite carriers are attempting to expand their service offerings
to include among other things highspeed internet service

     smatv  our cable systems also compete for subscribers  with smatv systems
smatv  system  operators  typically  are not  subject to  regulation  like local
franchised cable system operators smatv systems offer subscribers both improved
reception of local television stations and many of the same satellite delivered
programming  services  offered by franchised  cable systems  in addition  some
smatv operators are developing andor offering  packages of telephony  data and
video services to private residential and commercial developments  smatv system
operators often enter into exclusive service  agreements with building owners or
homeowners  associations  although  some states have  enacted  laws to provide
cable systems access to these complexes

     overbuilds  we  operate  our cable  systems  pursuant  to a  nonexclusive
franchise  that is  issued  by the  communitys  governing  body  such as a city
council a county board of supervisors or a state regulatory agency federal law
prohibits  franchising   authorities  from  unreasonably  denying  requests  for
additional franchises  and it permits franchising  authorities to operate cable
systems  companies that traditionally have not provided cable services and that
have substantial  financial resources such as public utilities that own certain
of the poles to which our cables are attached may also obtain cable  franchises
and may provide  competing  communications  services  certain  facilitiesbased
competitors offer cable and other communications services in various areas where
we hold franchises we anticipate that facilitiesbased competitors will develop
in other franchise areas that we serve

     local telephone companies  federal law allows local telephone companies to
provide  directly  to  subscribers   a  wide  variety  of  services  that  are
competitive  with our cable  services  including  video and  internet  services
within and outside their telephone service areas  telephone companies and other
businesses construct and operate  communications  facilities that provide access
to the internet and distribute  interactive  computerbased  services  data and
other nonvideo services to homes and businesses

     highspeed internet services

     most of our  cable  systems  are  currently  offering  highspeed  internet
services to subscribers these systems compete with a number of other companies
many of whom have substantial resources such as

      o     existing isps

      o     local telephone companies and

      o     long distance telephone companies

     the  deployment  of digital  subscriber  line  or dsl  technology  allows
internet  access to be  provided to  subscribers  over  telephone  lines at data
transmission  speeds  substantially  greater  than that of  conventional  analog
modems numerous companies  including telephone companies  have introduced dsl
service  and certain  telephone  companies  are seeking to provide  high speed
internet  services  without  regard  to  present  service  boundaries  and other
regulatory restrictions  the fcc recently adopted an order that will reduce the
obligations of local telephone companies to offer their broadband  facilities on
a wholesale basis to competitors and the fcc is considering further measures to
deregulate the retail broadband  offerings of local telephone companies as well
congress may also consider measures to deregulate such broadband offerings

     a number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated
isps access to their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements we
reached access agreements with several national and regional thirdparty isps
in addition  in connection with the  restructuring of twe we will enter into a
three year  nonexclusive  access agreement with aol time warner  we also have
agreed to offer  microsoft an access  agreement on terms no less  favorable than
those provided to other isps with respect to specified cable systems  we cannot
provide any assurance  however  that  regulatory  authorities  will not impose
open  access  or  similar  requirements  on us  as  part  of an  industrywide
requirement   these   requirements   could  adversely  affect  our  results  of
operations

     phone services

     our phone service  competes  against  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers
cellular  telephone  service  providers and competitive  local exchange carriers
including  established long distance companies in the provision of local voice
services  many of these  carriers  are  expanding  their  offerings  to include
highspeed internet service  such as dsl the incumbent local exchange carriers
have   substantial   capital   and  other   resources   longstanding   customer
relationships and extensive existing facilities and network rightsofway a few
competitive  local  exchange  carriers  also have  existing  local  networks and
significant financial resources

     we expect advances in communications  technology as well as changes in the
marketplace  and the  regulatory  and  legislative  environment  to occur in the
future  we refer you to page 11 for a detailed  discussion of  legislative  and
regulatory  factors  other new  technologies  and  services may develop and may
compete with services that our cable systems offer consequently  we are unable
to predict  the effect  that  ongoing or future  developments  might have on our
business and operations

transmission due to transponder failure  interruption or termination could have
a material adverse effect on qvcs results of operations

     program distributors

     qvc has entered into affiliation agreements with video program distributors
to carry qvc programming  there are no charges to the programming  distributors
for the  distribution  of qvc  in return for  carrying  qvc  each  programming
distributor  receives an allocated  portion  based upon market share  of up to
five percent of the net sales of  merchandise  sold to customers  located in the
programming   distributors  service  area  qvc  has  entered  into  multiyear
affiliation  agreements  with various cable and satellite  system  operators for
carriage  of qvc  programming  the  terms of most  affiliation  agreements  are
automatically  renewable for oneyear terms unless terminated by either party on
at least 90 days notice  prior to the end of the term  most of the  affiliation
agreements  provide for the  programming  distributor  to broadcast  commercials
regarding qvc on other channels and to distribute qvcs advertising  material to
subscribers

     qvcs business depends on its affiliation with programming distributors for
the  transmission of qvc programming  if a significant  number of homes were no
longer served because of  termination or nonrenewal of affiliation  agreements
our financial results could be adversely affected qvc has incentive programs to
induce programming  distributors to enter into or extend affiliation agreements
to increase the number of homes under  existing  affiliation  agreements  or to
enhance  channel  placement of the qvc  programming  these  incentives  include
various forms of marketing  carriage and launch  support  qvc will continue to
recruit additional programming distributors and seek to enlarge its audience

     competition

     qvc operates in a highly competitive environment  as a general merchandise
retailer  qvc  competes  for


                                       9 

page

consumer  expenditures  with the entire retail industry  including  department
discount  warehouse and specialty stores  mail order and other direct sellers
internet  retailers  shopping center and mall tenants and  conventional  retail
stores  on  television  qvc competes with other programs for channel space and
viewer loyalty  against similar  electronic  retailing  programming  as well as
against  alternative  programming  supplied by other  sources  including  news
public  affairs  entertainment  and  sports  programmers  the  use of  digital
compression  provides  programming  distributors  with greater channel capacity
while  greater  channel  capacity  increases  the  opportunity  for  qvc  to  be
distributed  it  also  may  adversely  impact  qvcs  ability  to  compete  for
television  viewers  to the  extent  it  results  in  higher  channel  position
placement of qvc in separate  programming  tiers or the addition of competitive
channels

                           legislation and regulation

     our  cable  and  phone  businesses  are  subject  to  numerous   regulatory
requirements  prohibitions and limitations imposed by various federal and state
laws  local ordinances and our franchise  agreements  our commerce and content
businesses  are generally  not subject to direct  governmental  regulation  our
highspeed internet business  while not currently regulated  may be subject to
regulation in the future  laws and regulations  affect the prices we can charge
for some services such as basic cable service and associated  customerpremises
equipment  the costs we incur  for example  for  attaching our wires to poles
owned by utility  companies  the relationships we establish with our suppliers
subscribers and competitors and many other aspects of our business

     the most  significant  federal law  affecting  our cable  businesses is the
communications act of 1934 as amended the provisions of the communications act
and the  manner in which the fcc  state and local  authorities  and the courts
implement  and  interpret  those  provisions  affect our ability to develop and
execute  business  plans  our  ability  to raise  capital  and the  competitive
dynamics  between  and  among  different  sectors  of  the   communications  and
entertainment  industries in which we operate the fcc also has the authority to
enforce its  regulations  through  the  imposition  of  substantial  fines  the
issuance of cease and desist orders and the  imposition of other  administrative
sanctions  such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate some of the
transmission facilities we use in connection with our cable businesses

     we believe we are currently in substantial


                                      11 

page

compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by
or under the communications  act but caution that the precise  requirements of
the law are not  always  clear  moreover  many  laws  and  regulations  can be
interpreted  in   afterthefact   enforcement   proceedings  or  private  party
litigation in a manner that is inconsistent  with the judgments we have made we
also note  that  regulators  at all  levels of  government  frequently  consider
changing and sometimes do change existing rules or interpretations of existing
rules  or prescribe new ones  judicial  decisions  often alter the  regulatory
framework in ways that are  inconsistent  with regulator  business and investor
expectations  in addition  our cable business can be significantly affected by
the  enactment  of new  legislation  owing  in  part to the  public  interest
ramifications  traditionally  associated  with  ownership of  electronic  media
congress  seriously  considers  the  enactment of new  legislative  requirements
virtually every year even though new laws  infrequently  result we always face
the risk that  congress  will approve  legislation  significantly  affecting the
cable industry

     a major objective of congress and the fcc is to increase competition in all
communications  services  including those central to our business for example
over the last ten years  congress removed barriers to local telephone companies
offering video services in their local service areas and the fcc has authorized
mvdds a new wireless service for providing multichannel video programming  and
may soon  consider a proposal that could allow utility power lines to be used to
provide video and  highspeed  internet  services  our cable  business could be
affected by any new competitors that enter the video  marketplace as a result of
these and similar  efforts by congress  or the fcc in  particular  we could be
materially  disadvantaged  if we are  subject  to new  regulations  that  do not
equally affect our satellite wireline and wireless competitors

     there are potential  risks  associated  with various  proceedings  that are
currently  pending  at the fcc  in the  courts  and before  federal  and state
legislatures  and  local  franchise   authorities   we  believe  few  of  these
proceedings  hold the potential to materially  affect our ability to conduct our
cable business among the more substantial areas of exposure are the following

     broadband  acquisition  the fcc  approved  the  broadband  acquisition  in
november  2002  subject  to  various  conditions  the  most  significant  are a
requirement for the  divestiture of our interest in twe a requirement  that the
twe interest be placed in trust pending divesture and safeguards that limit our
involvement in the  programmingrelated  activities of twe and two  partnerships
held  jointly  by us and twe  complying  with these  conditions  will limit our
flexibility  as to the timing and nature of a sale of the twe  interest  and in
the interim  will constrain our business dealings with twe and aol time warner
we have fully complied with those  conditions  and are committed to meeting our
obligations under the fccs merger order goingforward

     ownership limits  the fcc is considering  imposing  horizontal  ownership
limits that would limit the  percentage  of  multichannel  video  subscribers 
those that subscribe to cable dbs mmds and other  multichannel  distributors 
that any single  provider  could serve  nationwide  a federal  appellate  court
struck down the previous 30 limit  and the fcc is now  considering  this issue
anew as we already serve nearly 29 of multichannel video  subscribers  limits
similar to those originally imposed would restrict our ability to take advantage
of future  growth  opportunities  the fcc is also  assessing  whether it should
reinstate  vertical  ownership limits on the number of affiliated  programming
services a cable  operator may carry on its cable systems the previous limit of
40 of the first 75 channels had also been invalidated by the federal  appellate
court  while our video programming  interests are modest  new vertical limits
could  affect  our  content  related  business  plans   finally  the  fcc  is
considering revisions to its ownership attribution rules that would affect which
cable  subscribers  are counted under any horizontal  ownership  limit and which
programming interests are counted for purposes of a vertical ownership limit

     pricing  the  communications  act and the fccs  regulations  and policies
limit the prices that cable systems may charge for basic  services and equipment
in  communities  that are not subject to  effective  competition  as defined by
federal  law  failure to comply  with these  rate  rules  could  result in rate
reductions and refunds for subscribers in addition various advocacy groups are
urging congress to impose new rate regulations on the cable industry  we cannot
now predict  whether or when  congress may agree to these or similar  proposals
also  various  competitors  are  trying  to  persuade  the fcc and the  justice
department to limit our ability to respond to increased  competition by offering
promotions or other  discounts in an effort to retain  existing  subscribers  or
regain those we have lost  we believe our  competitive  pricing  practices  are
lawful  and  procompetitive   if  we  cannot  make  individualized  offers  to
subscribers  that would otherwise  choose a different  provider  our subscriber
attrition may increase or our overall prices may need to be reduced or both

     highspeed  internet service  ever since highspeed cable internet service
was introduced  some local governments and various competitors sought to impose
regulatory  requirements on how we deal with thirdparty  isps thus far only a
few local  governments  have


                                      12 

page

imposed  such  requirements  and  the  courts  have  invalidated  all of  them
likewise  the  fcc has  refused  to  treat  our  service  as a  common  carrier
telecommunications  service but has instead  classified it as an  interstate
information  service which has historically  meant that no regulations  apply
nonetheless  the fccs decision remains subject to judicial review  a decision
by a federal  appellate court is expected later this year in addition  the fcc
itself is still considering whether it should impose any regulatory requirements
and also whether  local  franchising  authorities  should be permitted to impose
fees or  other  requirements  such  as  service  quality  or  customer  service
standards  a few  franchising  authorities  have  sued us  seeking  payment  of
franchise fees on highspeed  internet service  revenues  further  a number of
software and content  providers and electronic  retailers are now urging the fcc
to adopt certain  nondiscrimination  principles that purport to be intended to
allow  internet  customers  access to the  internet  content  of their  choosing
something we already  provide  we cannot now predict whether these or similar
regulations will be adopted and if so what effects if any they would have on
our business

     internet  regulation  congress and federal  regulators have adopted a wide
range of measures  affecting  internet  use  including  for example  consumer
privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation and obscenity and
state  and  local  governmental   organizations  have  adopted  internetrelated
regulations   as  well  these  various  governmental  jurisdictions  are  also
considering  additional  regulations  in these and other areas  such as service
pricing  service and product quality and intellectual property ownership  the
adoption of new laws or the  adaptation of existing  laws to the internet  could
have a material adverse effect on our internet business

     mustcarryretransmission consent cable companies are currently subject to
a requirement that they carry without compensation the programming transmitted
by most commercial and noncommercial local television stations  alternatively
local television stations may negotiate for  retransmission  consent that is
terms and conditions to govern our ability to transmit the tv broadcast  signals
that cable subscribers expect to receive as broadcasters transition from analog
to digital transmission technologies  the fcc is considering whether to require
cable  companies to  simultaneously  carry both analog and digital  signals of a
single  broadcaster  and once  digital  carriage  is  required  whether  cable
companies may be required to carry multiple  digital  program  streams that each
broadcaster  may  transmit  if either of those  questions  is  answered  in the
affirmative  we would have less freedom to allocate the usable  spectrum of our
cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest
to our  subscribers  this could  diminish  our  ability  to attract  and retain
subscribers  we cannot now predict whether the fcc will impose these or similar
carriage obligations on us

     program access the communications act and the fccs program access rules
prevent  satellite  video  programmers  affiliated  with  cable  operators  from
favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video distributors such as
dbs and limit the ability of such  programmers to offer  exclusive  programming
arrangements  to cable  operators  the fcc recently  extended  the  exclusivity
restrictions through october 2007 the fcc has concluded that the program access
rules do not apply to programming services such as comcast sportsnet  that are
delivered  terrestrially  however the fcc has indicated that it may reconsider
how it regulates cable operators with regional sports  programming  interests in
its cable  ownership  rulemaking  any decision by the fcc or congress to single
out  for  new  regulation  cable  operators  like us who  have  regional  sports
programming interests could have an adverse impact on our cable and programming
businesses   some  initiatives  are  underway  to  enact  program   accesstype
regulations at the state or local level we believe any such  regulations  would
be preempted by federal law or otherwise unlawful but we cannot predict at this
time whether such regulations will be enacted or enforceable

     consumer  electronics  equipment  compatibility  the  fcc has  launched  a
rulemaking  to  implement  a recent  agreement  between  the cable and  consumer
electronics industries aimed at promoting the manufacture of plug andplay tv
sets that can  connect  directly  to the cable  network  without  the need for a
settop box  the fcc is  considering  adopting a number of proposed  rules that
would  among other  things  direct  cable  operators  to  implement  technical
standards in their networks to support these digital  television  sets  require
operators  to  provide a  sufficient  supply of  conditional  access  devices to
subscribers who want to receive scrambled  programming services on their digital
television  sets and require  operators to support basic home recording  rights
and copy protection rules for digital programming content failure by the fcc to
implement the agreement could adversely affect our  relationships  with consumer
electronics  retail outlets where dbs has  traditionally  enjoyed an advantage
and slow the growth of subscribership to our digital cable service

     phone service  our phone  business is subject to federal  state and local
regulation   in  general   the  communications  act  imposes   interconnection
requirements and universal service obligations on all telecommunications service
providers  including  those that  provide  traditional  circuitswitched  phone
service over cable  facilities  and more  significant  regulations on incumbent
local exchange carriers  such as verizon and

                                      13 

page

sbc the fcc has initiated several  rulemakings  which in the aggregate  could
significantly  change the rules that apply to telephone  competition  including
the  relationship  between  wireless and wireline  providers  long distance and
local  providers  and incumbents and new entrants  and it is unclear how those
proceedings  will affect our phone business  we are also  conducting  trials of
internet  protocol phone service on our cable network  and will begin a limited
commercial  offering  in 2003  while  the fcc and  most  state  public  utility
commissions  have thus far refrained  from  regulating  internet  protocol phone
service  it is  uncertain  whether  regulators  will  continue  to follow  that
approach

     franchise  matters  cable operators  generally operate their cable systems
pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a franchising authority or other
state or local governmental entity while the terms and conditions of franchises
vary materially from  jurisdiction to jurisdiction  these franchises  typically
last for a fixed term  obligate the  franchisee to pay franchise  fees and meet
service quality customer service and other requirements  and are terminable if
the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions  the communications act
includes provisions  governing the franchising process  including  among other
things  renewal procedures  designed to protect incumbent  franchisees  against
arbitrary  denials of renewal  we anticipate that our future franchise  renewal
prospects generally will be favorable

     state taxes  some states are  considering  imposing  new taxes  including
sales taxes on cable service we cannot predict at this time whether such taxes
will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business

     other regulatory  issues  there are a number of other  regulatory  matters
under review by congress  the fcc and other federal agencies that could affect
our cable business we briefly highlight those issues below

      o     cablebroadcast  crossownership  the  fcc  eliminated  regulations
            precluding the cross ownership of a national  broadcasting  network
            and a cable system and  pursuant to a federal court order  the fcc
            recently  repealed its regulations  prohibiting the common ownership
            of  other  broadcasting  interests  and  cable  systems  in the same
            geographical areas

      o     tier buy through the communications act requires cable operators to
            allow  subscribers  to  purchase  premium or  payperview  services
            without the necessity of subscribing  to any tier of service  other
            than the  basic  service  tier  the  applicability  of this rule in
            certain situations remains unclear and adverse decisions by the fcc
            on this  issue  could  affect  our  pricing  and  packaging  of such
            services

      o     leased  accesspeg   the  communications  act  permits  franchising
            authorities  to require  cable  operators to set aside  channels for
            public   educational  and  governmental  access  programming   and
            requires  a  cable  system  with 36 or more  activated  channels  to
            designate  a  significant   portion  of  its  channel  capacity  for
            commercial  leased  access by third  parties to provide  programming
            that may  compete  with  services  offered  by the  cable  operator
            neither  congress  nor  the  fcc is  considering  changes  to  these
            requirements but it is always possible that revisions could be made
            that would  place  further  burdens on the  channel  capacity of our
            cable systems

      o     obscenity  the  communications  act prohibits the  transmission  of
            obscene programming over cable systems some members of congress and
            the fcc  and  some  consumers  have  expressed  concerns  about  the
            distribution of certain adult programming over cable systems

      o     settop box  regulation  current fcc rules bar cable operators from
            leasing  subscribers  integrated  digital  settop  boxes  effective
            january 1 2005 we have urged elimination of the ban on the grounds
            that it will limit consumer choice increase the cost of settop box
            equipment  and slow the deployment of digital cable  services  but
            there is no assurance that the fcc will accept our position

      o     mdu access  the fcc has adopted rules to promote  competitive entry
            into the mdu market  these rules are intended to make it easier for
            new multichannel video service providers to compete with established
            cable operators although the fcc has declined to prohibit exclusive
            mdu service  agreements held by incumbent cable operators  including
            us that decision could be appealed and possibly changed

      o     pole  attachments  the  communications  act requires that utilities
            provide  cable  systems with  nondiscriminatory  access to any pole
            conduit or rightofway  controlled by the utility  and the fcc has
            adopted  rules  upheld  by the  courts  that  regulate  the  rates
            utilities  may charge for such  access  the  utilities  continue to
            litigate  various aspects of the fccs pole attachment  rulemakings
            and recent court decisions  leave open the possibility  that the fcc
            could alter the pole  attachment rate levels paid by cable


                                      14 

page


            operators  that provide  highspeed  internet  and cable  television
            offerings  over  those  attachments  although  the fcc has given no
            indication   that  it  will  do  so  adverse   decisions  in  these
            proceedings could potentially increase our pole attachment costs

      o     privacy  regulation  the communications act generally restricts the
            nonconsensual  collection  and disclosure of  subscribers  personal
            information  by  cable  operators  a strict  interpretation  of the
            communications  act could  severely  limit the  ability  of  service
            providers to collect and use  personal  information  for  commercial
            purposes  in addition  the federal  trade  commission  has adopted
            rules that will place sharp limits on the telemarketing practices of
            cable operators  and the fcc is considering  adopting similar rules
            as well

      o     copyright  regulation  in exchange for filing  certain  reports and
            contributing  a  percentage  of  their  revenue  to a  us  federal
            copyright   royalty  pool   cable   operators  can  obtain  blanket
            permission to retransmit  copyrighted material on broadcast signals
            the us  copyright office has recommended that congress revise this
            compulsory licensing scheme although congress has thus far declined
            to do so the  elimination or substantial  modification of the cable
            compulsory  license  could  adversely  affect our  ability to obtain
            certain  programming  and  substantially  increase  our  programming
            costs in addition  we pay standard industry  licensing fees to use
            music in the  programs we provide to  subscribers  including  local
            advertising  local origination programming and payperview events
            these licensing fees have been the source of litigation  between the
            cable industry and music  performance  rights  organizations  in the
            past  and we cannot  predict  with  certainty  whether  license fee
            disputes may arise in the future

      o     other areas  the fcc actively  regulates other aspects of our cable
            business  including  among  other  things  1  the  blackout  of
            syndicated  network  and sports programming  2 customer service
            standards 3 advertising in childrens programming  4 political
            advertising   5   origination   cablecasting   6   sponsorship
            identification  7 closed  captioning  of video  programming  8
            equal  employment   opportunity   9  lottery  programming   10
            emergency alert systems  and 11 technical  standards  relating to
            operation  of the  cable  network  the fcc is not  considering  any
            significant revisions to these rules at this time but we are unable
            to predict how these  regulations might be changed in the future and
            how any such changes might affect our business

     in all these  areas and a  variety  of  others  we face the  potential  of
increased regulation  given the intensely competitive nature of every aspect of
our business we believe that increased regulation is not warranted  we can not
provide  any  assurance  however  that  regulation  of our  business  will not
increase
                                    employees

     as of december 31 2002 we had approximately  82000  employees  of these
employees approximately 60000 were associated with cable approximately 15000
were associated with commerce and  approximately  7000 were associated with our
other divisions  approximately 4000 of our employees are covered by collective
bargaining  agreements  or have  organized  but are not  covered  by  collective
bargaining agreements  we believe that our relationships with our employees are
good

item 3 legal proceedings

     litigation  has been filed  against us as a result of our  alleged  conduct
with respect to our  investment in and  distribution  relationship  with at home
corporation  at home was a provider of highspeed  internet  access and content

other  corporate and  individual  defendants in the superior  court of san mateo
county  california  alleging  breaches of fiduciary duty on the part of us and
the other  defendants in connection  with  transactions  agreed to in march 2000
among at home us att and cox communications inc cox is also an investor in
at home and a former  distributor  of the at home  service  ii class  action
lawsuits  against  comcast cable  communications  inc  att and others in the
united states  district  court for the southern  district of new york  alleging
securities law violations  and common law fraud in connection  with  disclosures
made by at home in 2001  and  iii a  lawsuit  brought  in the  united  states
district court for the district of delaware in the name of at home by certain at
home bondholders against us brian l roberts cox and others alleging breaches
of fiduciary duty relating to the march 2000  transactions  and seeking recovery
of alleged  short swing  profits of at least 600  million  pursuant to section
16b  of the  securities  exchange  act of 1934  purported  to have  arisen  in
connection with certain transactions relating to at home stock effected pursuant
to the march 2000 agreements  the actions in san mateo county  california have
been stayed by the united states  bankruptcy court for the northern  district of
california  the court in which at home filed for  bankruptcy  as violating the
automatic  bankruptcy  stay in the southern  district of new york actions  the
court  ordered  the  actions  consolidated  into a  single  action  an  amended
consolidated  class action  complaint was filed on november 8 2002  all of the
defendants served motions to dismiss on february 11 2003

     under the terms of the broadband  acquisition  we are contractually liable
for 50 of any liabilities of att relating to at home  including any resulting
from any pending or threatened litigation att will be liable for the other 50
of these  liabilities  in addition to the actions against att described above
where we are also a defendant  there are two additional  actions  brought by at
homes bondholders liquidating trust against att not naming us i a lawsuit
filed against att and certain of its senior officers in santa clara california
state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties  misappropriation  of
trade secrets and other causes of action in connection with the  transactions in
march 2000 described above and prior and subsequent alleged conduct on the part
of the  defendants  and ii an action filed against att in the district court
for the northern district of california alleging that att infringes an at home
patent by using its broadband  distribution  and  highspeed  internet  backbone
networks  and  equipment  att moved to dismiss the santa  clara  action on the
grounds that  california is an inconvenient  forum  but the court denied atts
motion  att also moved to transfer the northern  district of california action
to the southern  district of new york as being a more convenient  venue  atts
motion is pending

     we deny any  wrongdoing in connection  with the claims which have been made
directly against us our subsidiaries and brian l roberts and intend to defend
all of these claims vigorously  in managements  opinion the final disposition
of these  claims  is not  expected  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on our
consolidated   financial  position  but  could  possibly  be  material  to  our
consolidated results of operations of any one period  further no assurance can
be given that any adverse  outcome  would not be  material  to our  consolidated
financial position

     management  is  continuing  to evaluate  this  litigation  and is unable to
currently  determine  what  impact  if any  that our 50  share of the at home
potential  liabilities  would have on our  consolidated  financial  position  or
results of operations  no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would
not be material

     some of the entities  formerly  attributed  to broadband  which are now our
subsidiaries  are parties to an  affiliation  term sheet with starz encore group
llc an affiliate of liberty media corporation  which extends to 2022 the term
sheet requires  annual fixed price  payments  subject to adjustment for various
factors  including inflation the term sheet also requires us to pay twothirds
of starz encores  programming  costs above levels designated in the term sheet
excess  programming  costs  that may be

payable  by us in  future  years  are not  presently  estimable  and  could  be
significant

     by letter dated may 29 2001  broadband disputed the enforceability of the
excess  programming pass through  provisions of the starz encore term sheet and
questioned the validity of the term sheet as a whole  broadband also has raised
certain issues  concerning  the  uncertainty of the provisions of the term sheet
and the contractual  interpretation and application of certain of its provisions
to among other things  the acquisition  and  disposition of cable systems  in
july 2001  starz encore filed a lawsuit in colorado state court seeking payment
of the 2001 excess  programming costs and a declaration that the term sheet is a
binding and enforceable  contract  in october 2001  broadband and starz encore
agreed to delay any further  proceedings in the litigation until august 31 2002
to allow the parties time to continue  negotiations  toward a potential business
resolution of this dispute as part of this standstill agreement  broadband and
starz encore settled starz encores claim for the 2001 excess programming costs
and broadband agreed to continue to make the standard monthly payments due under
the  term  sheet  with a full  reservation  of  rights  with  respect  to these
payments in connection with the standstill agreement  the court granted a stay
on  october  30  2001  the terms of the stay  order  allowed  either  party to
petition the court to lift the stay after april 30 2002 and to proceed with the
litigation broadband and starz encore agreed to extend the standstill agreement
to and including  january 31 2003 with a requirement  that the parties attempt
to mediate the dispute  a mediation session held in january 2003 did not result
in any resolution of the matter

     on november  18  2002  we filed suit  against  starz encore in the united
states  district  court for the  eastern  district  of  pennsylvania  we seek a
declaratory  judgment  that  pursuant  to our  rights  under a march  17  1999
contract  with a  predecessor  of  starz  encore  upon  the  completion  of the
broadband  acquisition  that  contract  now provides the terms under which starz
encore programming is acquired and transmitted by our cable systems  on january
8 2003  starz encore filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that
claims asserted by us raised issues of state law that the united states district
court should decline to decide  we have responded  contesting these assertions
the motion has been submitted to the court for decision

     on january 31 2003 starz encore filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit
against  broadband in colorado  state court  the amended  complaint adds us and
comcast  holdings as defendants and adds new claims against us comcast holdings
and  broadband  asserting  alleged  breaches  of  and  interference  with  the
standstill agreement relating to the lawsuit filed by us and comcast holdings in
federal  district court in  pennsylvania  and to the  defendants  position that
since the  completion of the broadband  acquisition  the march 17 1999 contract
provides  the terms  under  which  starz  encore  programming  is  acquired  and
transmitted by our cable systems

     on march 3 2003  starz  encore  filed a motion for leave to file a second
amended complaint that would add allegations that broadband has breached certain
jointmarketing  obligations  under  the  term  sheet  and  that we and  comcast
holdings have breached certain  jointmarketing  obligations under the march 17
1999 contract and other agreements we comcast holdings and broadband intend to
oppose starz encores  motion for leave to file a second amended  complaint and
in light of starz  encores  pending  motion for leave to amend  have sought an
extension of time from the court to respond to starz encores amended complaint

     an entity formerly attributed to broadband which is now our subsidiary is
party to a master  agreement that may not expire until december 31 2012  under
which it purchases  certain billing  services from csg systems  inc the master
agreement  requires monthly payments  subject to adjustment for inflation  the
master  agreement also contains a most favored nation  provision that may affect
the amounts paid thereunder

     on may 10  2002  broadband  filed a demand for  arbitration  against  csg
before the american arbitration  association asserting  among other things the
right to  terminate  the master  agreement  and seeking  damages  under the most
favored nation provision or otherwise on may 31 2002 csg answered broadbands
arbitration demand and asserted various counterclaims  including for i breach
of the master agreement  ii a declaration that we are now bound by the master
agreement to use csg as our exclusive  provider for certain billing and customer
care  services   iii  tortious  interference  with  prospective   contractual
relations  and iv civil conspiracy a hearing in the arbitration is scheduled
to commence on may 5 2003

     on june 21 2002 csg filed a lawsuit against  comcast  holdings in federal
court in denver  colorado  asserting claims related to the master agreement and
the pending arbitration on november 4 2002 csg withdrew its complaint against
comcast holdings without prejudice on november 15 2002 we initiated a lawsuit
against csg in federal court in philadelphia  pennsylvania asserting that cable
systems  owned by  comcast  holdings  are not  required  to use csg as a billing
service or customer care provider pursuant to the master agreement and that the
former  broadband  cable  systems  we now own may be added to a billing  service
agreement  between us and csg  csg moved to dismiss

or stay the lawsuit on the ground that the issues raised by the complaint  could
be wholly or substantially  determined by the  abovementioned  arbitration  by
order dated  february  10  2003  the court  stayed the lawsuit  until  further
notice

     on january 8 2003  liberty  digital  inc  filed a complaint in colorado
state court against us and comcast cable holdings  llc formerly att broadband
llc and telecommunications  inc our wholly owned subsidiary  the complaint
alleges that comcast cable  holdings  breached a 1997  contribution  agreement
between  liberty  digital  and comcast  cable  holdings  and that we  tortiously
interfered  with that  agreement  the  complaint  alleges  that this  purported
agreement  obligates  comcast  cable  holdings  to pay fees to  liberty  digital
totaling 18 million  increasing  at cpi per year through 2017 we and comcast
cable  holdings  filed our answer to the complaint on march 5 2003 in which we
denied  the  essential   allegations  of  the  complaint  and  asserted  various
affirmative defenses

     in managements opinion the final disposition of the starz encore csg and
liberty digital contractual  disputes is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations however
no assurance can be given that any adverse  outcome would not be material to our
consolidated financial position or results of operations

     we are subject to other legal  proceedings  and claims  which  arise in the
ordinary course of our business in the opinion of our management the amount of
ultimate  liability  with respect to such actions is not expected to  materially

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
       results of operations

overview

     we  have  grown  significantly  in  recent  years  through  both  strategic
acquisitions  and growth in our existing  businesses  on november 18 2002  we
completed the  acquisition of att corps  broadband  business the  broadband
acquisition the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our
cable  operations  and  caused  significant  changes in our  capital  structure
including a substantially higher amount of debt as a result direct comparisons
of our results of  operations  and  financial  condition  for  periods  prior to
november 18 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful

     in  february  2003  we  announced  that we had entered  into a  definitive
agreement with bresnan broadband holdings llc and bresnan  communications  llc
together  bresnan  pursuant to which we agreed to transfer to bresnan  cable
systems serving approximately 317000 subscribers in montana  wyoming colorado
and utah that we had acquired in connection with the broadband  acquisition  we
reflect these systems as assets held for sale in our consolidated  balance sheet
and as  discontinued  operations in our  consolidated  statement of  operations
accordingly  we have excluded  these  systems  results in our  discussions  of
liquidity  and  capital  resources  statement  of cash  flows  and  results  of
operations for all periods presented

     we have  historically  met our cash needs for  operations  through our cash
flows from operating activities we have generally financed our acquisitions and
capital  expenditures  through  issuances  of our common  stock  borrowings  of
longterm debt  sales of investments  and from existing cash cash  equivalents
and shortterm investments

general developments of business

     refer to general developments of our business in part i and note 5 to our
financial statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and
other significant events

significant and subjective estimates

     the  following  discussion  and  analysis of our  financial  condition  and
results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the united states the preparation of these financial  statements requires us
to make  estimates  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets  liabilities
revenues  and  expenses   and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results
of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

     refer  to  note 2 to our  financial  statements  included  in  item 8 for a
discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items

critical accounting judgments and estimates

     we  believe  our  judgments  and  related  estimates  associated  with  the
impairment  testing  and  valuation  of our  cable  franchise  rights  and  the
valuation of acquisition related assets liabilities and legal contingencies to
be  critical  in the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial  statements
management  has  discussed  the  development  and  selection  of these  critical
accounting  judgments  and  estimates  with the audit  committee of our board of
directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures  relating to them
presented below

     impairment testing and valuation of cable franchise rights

     our  cable  systems  are  constructed  and  operated  under   nonexclusive
franchises  granted  by state  or local  governmental  authorities  for  varying
lengths  of time  as of  december  31  2002  we  served  approximately  4600
franchise areas in the united states we have concluded that our cable franchise
rights have an  indefinite  useful  life since  there are no legal  regulatory
contractual  competitive  economic or other  factors  limiting the period over
which these rights will  contribute  to our cash flows  accordingly  our cable
franchise rights are not subject to amortization  but are assessed  periodically
for impairment in accordance  with statement of financial  accounting  standards
sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets

     we  have  acquired  these  franchise  rights  either  directly  from  local
franchise  authorities or through many separate cable system  acquisitions  that
include  multiple  franchise  territories  upon  acquisition  we integrate the
individual  franchise  territories into our national footprint  while our cable
division  is  organized  nationally  into six  geographic  divisions  which are
further  organized into  geographic  clusters of cable  systems  we operate our
cable  operations  and their  associated  franchise  rights  as a single  asset
essentially inseparable from one another

                                      22

we have concluded that the  preponderance  of indicators in emerging issues task
force   eitf   027   unit  of  accounting   for  testing   impairment  of
indefinitelived intangible assets supports the testing of our cable franchise
rights for  impairment  at the cable  segment  level  which is the same unit of
accounting used by us to test cablerelated goodwill for impairment

     we assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more
frequently  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable  we estimate the fair value of our cable
franchise  rights  primarily  based on a multiple  of  operating  income  before
depreciation and amortization ebitda generated by the underlying assets the
ebitda  multiple used in our  evaluation is determined  based on our analyses of
current market  transactions  profitability  information  including  estimated
future operating  results  trends or other  determinants of fair value we also
consider other valuation  methods such as discounted cash flow analyses  if the
value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than
its carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference
between the estimated  fair value and the carrying  value of the assets  future
adverse  changes in market  conditions or poor operating  results of the related
business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying  value of the assets
thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge

     as more fully described in note 5 to our financial  statements  included in
item 8 see  acquisition of broadband  the fair value of the shares issued for
broadband was based on the date the nonequity  or other  consideration being
paid was substantively  changed from the terms of the original merger agreement
the fair value of the shares issued for broadband  based on the new  measurement
date was approximately  onehalf the fair value assigned to the shares as of the
date  of  the  original  merger  agreement   accordingly  the  effect  of  the
modification was to reduce by approximately onehalf approximately 23 billion
the value  assigned to the equity  consideration  issued in connection  with the
broadband  acquisition  as a  significant  portion  of the  purchase  price was
allocated  to  indefinitelived  cable  franchise  rights and to  goodwill  the
reduction in the fair value of the equity  consideration  reduces the likelihood
of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights or goodwill

     the carrying  amount of cable  franchise  rights  related to our historical
cable  systems is  significantly  less than their current  estimated  fair value
largely  because we acquired many of these rights  directly from local franchise
authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions  conversely
the carrying amount of cable  franchise  rights for our more recent cable system
acquisitions has not been  significantly  reduced through  amortization and has
not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of sfas
no  142  nevertheless  testing for  impairment  at the cable  segment  level
reduces  the  likelihood  of a future  impairment  charge  related  to our cable
franchise rights

     fair  value  of  acquisition   related   assets   liabilities   and  legal
contingencies

     we allocate  the purchase  price of acquired  companies to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values in determining fair value  management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the recorded amounts  to assist in this process  third
party  valuation  specialists  are engaged to value  certain of these assets and
liabilities

     estimates used in valuing  acquired assets and liabilities  include but are
not  limited  to  expected  future cash  flows  market  rate  assumptions  for
contractual  obligations  actuarial  assumptions for benefit plans  settlement
plans  for  litigation  and  contingencies   and  appropriate  discount  rates
managements  estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions  believed to be
reasonable   but  which  are  inherently  uncertain  in  addition   estimated
liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations including the exiting
of contractual  obligations  and the  termination  of employees  are subject to
change as management  continues its  assessment of operations  and finalizes its
integration plans

     the assets and assumed  liabilities  related to the  broadband  acquisition
requiring  significant  judgment in estimating  fair value include  investments
cable  franchise  rights  franchise  related  customer  relationships  assumed
contractual and other obligations  and costs related to terminating  certain of
broadbands  contractual obligations and employees in addition we are party to
certain  broadband  legal  contingencies  including  those described in item 3
legal proceedings  if based on information available a potential loss arising
from these  lawsuits  claims and actions  was deemed  probable  and  reasonably
estimable we recorded the estimated liability in the purchase price allocation
while  management  believes the recorded  liabilities  are adequate  additional
information  related to these cases is still being  obtained  in addition  the
inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to
exceed expected losses

     our estimates associated with the accounting for the broadband  acquisition
have and will continue to change as final reports from valuation specialists are
obtained and additional  information becomes available regarding

                                      23

assets acquired and liabilities assumed  since the publication of our 2002 year
end earnings release  the ongoing valuation and allocation process has resulted
in   inconsequential   changes  to  the  balance  sheet   primarily   affecting
nonamortizable intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities  changes
in the amounts assigned to other acquisition  related assets and liabilities may
affect  operating  results  or gains or losses upon the  disposition  of assets
acquired in future periods

liquidity and capital resources

     the  cable  and  the  electronic   retailing  industries  are  experiencing
increasing  competition and rapid technological  changes  our future results of
operations  will  be  affected  by  our  ability  to  react  to  changes  in the
competitive  environment  and by our ability to implement new  technologies  we
believe that competition and technological changes will not significantly affect
our ability to obtain financing

     in  order  to  preserve  the  treatment  of the  broadband  acquisition  as
taxfree our ability to redeem stock or issue equity securities will be limited
through  december  2004 as of december 31 2002 we had the ability to issue at
least 250 million shares of our common stock without affecting the tax treatment
of the broadband acquisition

     we believe that we will be able to meet our current and longterm liquidity
and capital requirements  including fixed charges  through our cash flows from
operating  activities  existing cash  cash  equivalents and  investments  and
through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities

     available sources of financing to fund these requirements include

      o     our existing cash and cash  equivalents  which totaled 781 million
            as of december 31 2002

      o     amounts available under our and our  subsidiaries  lines of credit
            which totaled 5949 billion as of december 31 2002

      o     proceeds  of  approximately  525  million  from  the  sale of cable
            systems   to   bresnan   broadband   holdings   llc   and   bresnan
            communications  llc a transaction  we expect will close by the end
            of the first quarter of 2003

      o     proceeds of approximately 725 million from the sale of our interest
            in a cable  joint  venture  with  charter  communications  inc  a
            transaction we expect to close in april 2003 and

      o     through  the  sales  or  restructurings  of our  other  investments
            including  21 billion of cash due upon the  restructuring  of time
            warner entertainment lp twe

     in addition  as more fully described in note 5 to our financial statements
included  in  item  8  see  twe   restructuring   upon  closing  of  the  twe
restructuring  agreement  we will  receive  15 billion in common stock of aol
time warner and an approximate 21 equity interest in time warner cable inc

     refer to the contractual obligations table on page 29 and to note 13 to our
financial  statements included in item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and
contingencies

     cash and cash equivalents

     we have  traditionally  maintained  significant  levels  of cash  and  cash
equivalents to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements  our cash equivalents
are recorded at fair value  cash and cash  equivalents  as of december 31 2002
were 781 million substantially all of which is unrestricted

     investments

     a significant  portion of our investments are in publicly traded  companies
and are reflected at fair value which fluctuates with market changes

     we do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect
to any of our  investments  our ownership  interests in these  investments may
however be diluted if we do not fund our investees  nonbinding capital calls
we  continually  evaluate our existing  investments  as well as new  investment
opportunities

     refer  to  note 6 to our  financial  statements  included  in  item 8 for a
discussion of our investments

     capital expenditures

     during  2003  we expect to incur  approximately  42  billion  of capital
expenditures  in  our  cable   commerce  and  content   businesses   including
approximately 4 billion for our cable operations

     we  anticipate  capital  expenditures  for  years  subsequent  to 2003 will
continue  to be  significant  as of  december  31  2002  we do not  have  any
significant contractual obligations for capital expenditures

     cable

     we expect our 2003 cable capital  expenditures  will include  approximately
13 billion for the upgrading and  rebuilding of certain of our cable  systems
approximately

                                      24

18 billion for the  deployment of cable  modems  digital  converters  and new
service  offerings   and  approximately  09  billion  for  recurring  capital
projects

     we expect to  substantially  complete  the upgrade and rebuild of the newly
acquired  systems  by the end of 2004 for a total  cost of 22  billion to 25
billion  the amount of our capital  expenditures  for years  subsequent to 2003
will depend on numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including

      o     competition

      o     changes in technology and

      o     the timing and rate of deployment of new services

     commerce

     during  2003  we expect to incur  approximately  125  million  of capital
expenditures for qvc  primarily to maintain qvcs  distribution  facilities and
information  systems  capital  expenditures in qvcs  international  operations
represent nearly 40 of qvcs total capital expenditures

     on march 3 2003 we announced that liberty media  corporation  delivered a
notice to us  pursuant to the  stockholders  agreement  between us and liberty
that triggers an exit rights process with respect to libertys  approximate  42
interest in qvc we and liberty will attempt to negotiate  the fair market value
of qvc prior to march 31 2003  if we and liberty  cannot  agree  an appraisal
process will determine the value of qvc we will then have the right to purchase
libertys  interest in qvc at the determined  value  we may pay liberty for the
qvc stock in cash in a promissory note maturing not more than three years after
issuance  in our equity  securities  or in a combination  of these  subject to
libertys  right to request  payment in all equity  securities  and the parties
obligation to use reasonable  efforts to consummate the purchase in the most tax
efficient  method  available  provided  that  we  are  not  required  to  issue
securities  representing more than 49 of the outstanding equity or vote of our
common stock  if we elect not to purchase  libertys  interest in qvc liberty
then will have a similar right to purchase our  approximate 57 interest in qvc
if neither we nor liberty  elect to purchase the interest of the other  then we
and liberty are required to use our best efforts to sell qvc  either company is
permitted  to be a purchaser  in any such sale  we and liberty may agree not to
enter  into a  transaction  or may  agree  to a  transaction  other  than  that
specified  in  the  stockholders  agreement  under  the  current  terms  of the
stockholders agreement between us and liberty we would no longer control qvc if
we elect not to purchase libertys interest in qvc
     affiliation agreements

     certain  of  our  content   subsidiaries  and  qvc  enter  into  multiyear
affiliation  agreements  with various cable and satellite  system  operators for
carriage of their respective  programming  in connection with these affiliation
agreements we generally pay a fee to the cable or satellite operator based upon
the number of subscribers  during 2003 we expect to incur 150 million to 200
million related to these affiliation agreements excluding amounts applicable to
our cable systems

     financing

     as of  december  31  2002 and 2001  our  debt  including  capital  lease
obligations was 34910 billion and 12202 billion  respectively the 22708
billion  increase  from  december 31 2001 to december 31 2002 results from the
effects  of the  broadband  acquisition  offset  by  the  effects  of net  debt
repayments included in our debt as of december 31 2002 was shortterm debt and
current portion of longterm debt of 6953 billion

     in january and march 2003  we sold an  aggregate of 30 billion of public
debt  consisting of 600 million of 585 senior notes due 2010 900 million of
650  senior  notes due 2015  750  million of 550 senior notes due 2011 and
750  million of 705  senior  notes due 2033  we used all of the net proceeds
from the offerings to repay a portion of our shortterm debt

     as a result of the broadband  acquisition  we assumed  notes  exchangeable
into the common stock of  cablevision  ny group class a common stock  microsoft
corporation  microsoft  common  stock  vodafone  adrs  and comcast class a
special  common stock  together  the  exchangeable  notes  at maturity the
exchangeable notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into i a number of
shares of common stock or adrs equal to the underlying  shares  multiplied by an
exchange ratio as defined or ii its cash equivalent  the maturity value of
the  exchangeable  notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security
to which  it is  indexed  the  exchangeable  notes  are  collateralized  by our
investments in cablevision  microsoft and vodafone respectively and our class
a special common stock held in treasury

     as of december 31 2002  our debt includes an aggregate of 5459  billion
of  exchangeable  notes  including  1555  billion and 3904  billion  within
current  portion of  longterm  debt and  longterm  debt  respectively  as of
december 31 2002 our investments include  cablevision  microsoft and vodafone

noncurrent investments respectively upon closing of the broadband acquisition
we  classified  the comcast  shares  which are held by a subsidiary of ours as
treasury  stock  within  stockholders  equity  as of december  31  2002  the
securities held by us collateralizing  the exchangeable notes were sufficient to
satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding exchangeable notes

     excluding the effects of interest rate risk management  instruments  318
and 134 of our long term debt including shortterm debt and current portion
as of december  31 2002 and 2001  respectively  was at  variable  rates  the
increase  from  december 31 2001 to december 31 2002 in the  percentage of our
variable  rate  debt  was  due  principally  to the  effects  of  the  broadband
acquisition

     we have  and may from time to time in the  future  depending  on  certain
factors  including  market  conditions  make  optional  repayments  on our debt
obligations which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public
notes and debentures

     refer to notes 8 and 10 to our financial  statements included in item 8 for
a discussion of our financing activities

     interest rate risk management

     we are exposed to the market risk of adverse  changes in interest rates we
maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative
transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these
exposures  we  monitor  our  interest  rate  risk  exposures  using  techniques
including  market value and  sensitivity  analyses  we do not hold or issue any
derivative  financial  instruments  for trading  purposes and are not a party to
leveraged instruments we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative
financial   instruments   through  the   evaluation   and   monitoring   of  the
creditworthiness of the counterparties  although we may be exposed to losses in
the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we do not expect such losses
if any to be significant

     we  use  interest  rate  exchange  agreements  swaps  to  exchange  at
specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts
calculated by reference to an  agreedupon  notional  principal  amount  we use
interest rate lock  agreements  rate locks to hedge the risk that cash flows
related to the interest  payments on an  anticipated  issuance or  assumption of
fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations  we use
interest rate cap agreements  caps to lock in a maximum interest rate should
variable rates rise  but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates  we use
interest  rate  collar  agreements  collars  to limit  our  exposure  to and
benefits  from  interest  rate  fluctuations  on variable  rate debt to within a
certain range of rates

results of operations

     the effects of the broadband  acquisition and our other recent acquisitions
were to increase  our  revenues  and  expenses  resulting  in  increases in our
operating  income before  depreciation  and  amortization  the increases in our
property  and  equipment   intangible   assets  and  longterm  debt  and  the
corresponding  increases in depreciation  expense and interest expense from 2001
to 2002 are primarily due to the effects of the broadband  acquisition  and the
increases   from  2000  to  2001  are  primarily  due  to  the  effects  of  our
acquisitions  our cable systems  exchanges and our increased  levels of capital
expenditures

     as the effect of the broadband  acquisition was to  substantially  increase
the  size  of  our  cable  operations  direct  comparisons  of our  results  of
operations  and  financial  condition  for periods prior to november 18 2002 to
subsequent  periods are not meaningful  refer to pro forma 2002 results below

1  operating income before  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred
     to in our  businesses  as  ebitda  ebitda  is a measure  of a  companys
     ability to generate cash to service its obligations including debt service
     obligations and to finance capital and other expenditures  in part due to
     the  capital   intensive   nature  of  our  businesses  and  the  resulting
     significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense ebitda
     is  frequently  used as one of the bases for  comparing  businesses  in our
     industries  although  our  measure  of  ebitda  may not be  comparable  to
     similarly titled measures of other  companies  ebitda is the primary basis
     used  by  our  management  to  measure  the  operating  performance  of our
     businesses  ebitda  does not purport to  represent  net income or net cash
     provided  by  operating  activities  as  those  terms  are  defined  under
     generally accepted accounting  principles  and should not be considered as
     an alternative to such measurements as an indicator of our performance see
     statement  of cash flows above for a discussion  of net cash  provided by
     operating activities

     video revenue consists of our basic expanded basic premium payperview
equipment and digital  cable  services  of the 1238  billion and 627 million
increases  in video  revenues  from  2001 to 2002 and  from  2000 to 2001  945
million and 339 million  respectively  are attributable to the effects of our
acquisitions  of cable systems and 293 million and 288 million  respectively
relate to changes in rates and subscriber  growth in our historical  operations
driven principally by growth in digital subscribers  and to a lesser extent to
the effects of a higher priced digital service offering made in the second half
of 2000 during 2002 we added approximately  4374000 digital subscribers as a
result of the broadband  acquisition and we added approximately  505000 digital
subscribers through growth in our historical  operations  during 2001 and 2000
through  acquisitions  and  growth  in  our  historical  operations   we  added
approximately 534000 and 753000 digital subscribers respectively

     the  increases in  highspeed  internet  revenue from 2001 to 2002 and from
2000  to  2001  are  primarily  due  to  the  addition  of  highspeed  internet
subscribers  during 2002 we added approximately  2094000 highspeed internet
subscribers as a result of the broadband  acquisition and we added approximately
578000  high  speed  internet  subscribers  through  growth in our  historical
operations  during  2001 and  2000  through  acquisitions  and  growth  in our
historical  operations  we added  approximately  548000 and 258000 highspeed
internet subscribers respectively

     the increase in  advertising  sales revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the
effects of the  broadband  acquisition  as well as to the effects of a stronger
advertising  market  and  the  continued  leveraging  of our  marketwide  fiber
interconnects  the increase in advertising  sales revenue from 2000 to 2001 was
attributable  to the effects of new  advertising  contracts  marketwide  fiber
interconnects and

                                      31

the continued  leveraging of our existing fiber  networks  helping to offset an
otherwise weak advertising environment

     other  revenue  includes  phone  revenues   installation  revenues  guide
revenues commissions from electronic retailing revenues of our regional sports
programming networks and revenue from other product offerings the increase from
2001 to 2002 in other  revenue is  primarily  attributable  to  increased  phone
revenues and other product  revenues as a result of the  broadband  acquisition
the increase from 2000 to 2001 in other revenue is primarily attributable to the
effects of our acquisition of home team sports now known as csn  midatlantic
the remaining increases from 2000 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2002 are attributable
to growth in our historical operations

     the increase in operating  selling  general and  administrative  expenses
from 2001 to 2002 is  primarily  attributable  to the  effects of the  broadband
acquisition  as well as to the  effects  of  increases  in the  costs  of cable
programming  increases in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our
historical  operations  and to a lesser  extent  to the effects of highspeed
internet subscriber growth

     on september 28 2001 at home corporation at home our former provider
of highspeed  internet  services  filed for protection under chapter 11 of the
us  bankruptcy code in october 2001 we amended our agreement with at home to
continue service to our existing and new subscribers during october and november
2001  we agreed  to be  charged a higher  rate than we had  incurred  under our
previous  agreement  on december 3 2001  we reached a  definitive  agreement
approved by the bankruptcy  court with at home pursuant to which at home agreed
to continue to provide  highspeed  internet  services to our  existing  and new
subscribers  through  february 28 2002 in december  2001 we began to transfer
our  highspeed  internet  subscribers  from  the at  home  network  to our  new
comcastowned  and managed  network  we completed  this  transition in february
2002  operating  expenses in our  consolidated  statement of operations for the
year ended  december 31 2001 include 140 million of net  incremental  expenses
incurred  in the fourth  quarter of 2001 in the  continuation  of service to and
transition of our highspeed internet  subscribers from at homes network to our
network

     the remaining  increases from 2000 to 2001 in operating  selling  general
and administrative expenses are primarily due to the effects of our acquisitions
and  exchanges of cable  systems  as well as to the effects of increases in the
costs of cable programming  highspeed  internet  subscriber growth  and to a
lesser extent increases in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our
historical operations

     our  cost of  programming  increases  as a  result  of  changes  in  rates
subscriber  growth  additional  channel  offerings  and  our  acquisitions  and
exchanges of cable  systems  we anticipate the cost of cable  programming  will
increase  in the  future as cable  programming  rates  increase  and  additional
sources of cable programming become available

     of the 464 million and 381 million increases in net sales from electronic
retailing  from  2001 to 2002  and  from  2000 to 2001  296  million  and 332
million  respectively  is attributable to increases in net sales in the united
states this growth is principally the result of increases in the average number
of homes receiving qvc services and in net sales per home as follows



                                                                        year ended december 31
                                                                      2002                  2001
                                                               

                                                                                        
increase in average number of homes in us         36                   38
increase in net sales per home in us         53                   65


     it is  unlikely  that  the  number  of  homes  receiving  the  qvc  service
domestically  will  continue to grow at rates  comparable to prior periods given
that the qvc service is already received by approximately  97 of all us cable
television homes and  substantially  all satellite  television homes in the us
future growth in sales will depend  increasingly  on continued  additions of new
customers from homes already  receiving the qvc service and continued  growth in
repeat sales to existing customers

     the  remaining  increases of 168 million and 49 million in net sales from
electronic  retailing  from  2001 to 2002  and from  2000 to 2001 are  primarily
attributable to increases in net sales in germany japan and the united kingdom
offset  in part by the effects of  fluctuations in foreign  currency  exchange
rates during the periods

     the increases in cost of goods sold from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001
are primarily  related to the growth in net sales the increases in gross margin
are primarily due to the effects of increases in product margins

     the increases in operating  selling  general and administrative  expenses
from 2001 to 2002 and from  2000 to 2001 are  primarily  attributable  to higher
variable costs and personnel costs associated with the increase in sales volume

     consolidated analysis

     interest expense

     the increase in interest  expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to our increased
amount  of debt  outstanding  as a  result  of the  broadband  acquisition  the
increase in interest expense from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the increases
in our net borrowings

     we anticipate  that for the foreseeable  future  interest expense will be
significant  we believe  we will  continue  to be able to meet our  obligations
through our ability both to generate  operating  income before  depreciation and
amortization and to obtain external financing

     the investment  impairment losses for the years ended december 31 2002 and
2001 relate  principally to an other than temporary decline in our investment in
att

     during the year ended  december 31 2001 we wroteoff our investment in at
home common  stock based upon a decline in the  investment  that was  considered
other than  temporary  in connection  with the  realization of this  impairment
loss we reclassified to investment income expense the accumulated  unrealized
gain of 238  million  on our  investment  in at home  common  stock  which  was
previously  recorded as a component of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
loss we recorded this accumulated unrealized gain prior to our designation of
our right under a stockholders agreement as a hedge of our investment in the at
home common stock

     in june 2001  we and att  entered  into an  amended  and  restated  share
issuance  agreement  the  share  issuance  agreement   att  issued  to  us
approximately  803  million  unregistered  shares of att  common  stock and we
agreed to settle our right  under the share  exchange  agreement  to exchange an
aggregate 312 million at home shares and warrants held by us for shares of att
common stock under the terms of the share issuance  agreement  we retained the
at home  shares  and  warrants  held by us we  recorded  to  investment  income
expense a pretax  gain of 296  million  representing  the fair value of the
increased  consideration  received  by us to settle  our  right  under the share
exchange agreement

     in connection  with the  reclassification  of our  investment in sprint pcs
from  an  available  for  sale  security  to a  trading  security  in  2001  we
reclassified to investment  income expense the accumulated  unrealized gain of
1092 billion on our investment in sprint pcs which was previously  recorded as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss

     income related to indexed debt

     prior to the adoption of sfas no 133 on january 1 2001  we accounted for
the zones as an indexed debt  instrument  since the maturity  value is dependent
upon the fair value of sprint pcs common stock  during the year ended  december
31 2000 we recorded  income related to indexed debt of 666 million to reflect
the fair value of the underlying sprint pcs stock

     equity in net losses of affiliates

     the  increase  in equity in net losses of  affiliates  from 2001 to 2002 is
primarily due to other than  temporary  declines in certain of our equity method
investees the effects of our additional investments changes in the net

                                      34

income or loss of our equity method investees  as well as to the effects of the
discontinuance  of  amortization  of equity  method  goodwill as a result of the
adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002  the increase  from 2000 to 2001 is
primarily attributable to the effects of our additional investments  as well as
the effects of changes in the net income or loss of our equity method investees

     other income

     on october 30 2001 we acquired from fox  entertainment  group inc fox
entertainment  the approximate  832 interest in outdoor life network oln
not previously  owned by us upon closing of the  acquisition  we exchanged our
145 interest in speedvision  network svn  together with a previously made
loan for fox  entertainments  interest in oln in connection with the exchange
of our interest in svn we recorded a pretax gain of 107 million representing
the difference between the estimated fair value of our interest in svn as of the
closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in svn

     on january 1 2001 we completed  our cable systems  exchange with adelphia
communications  corporation  adelphia  we received  cable  systems  serving
approximately 445000 subscribers from adelphia and adelphia received certain of
our cable systems serving approximately 441000 subscribers  we recorded a pre
tax gain of 1199 billion  representing  the difference  between the estimated
fair value of 1799 billion as of the closing date of the  transaction  and our
cost basis in the systems exchanged

     on december 31 2000 we completed our cable systems exchange with att we
received cable systems serving  approximately  770000 subscribers from att and
att  received  certain  of our  cable  systems  serving  approximately  700000
subscribers  we recorded a pretax  gain of 1711  billion  representing  the
difference  between the estimated fair value of 2840 billion as of the closing
date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged

     in august  2000  we obtained  the right to  exchange  our at home series a
common  stock with att and we waived  certain  of our at home  board  level and
shareholder rights under a stockholders  agreement we also agreed to cause our
existing  appointee to the at home board of directors to resign  in  connection
with the transaction we recorded a pretax gain of 1045 billion representing
the estimated fair value of the investment as of the closing date

     in august  2000  we exchanged  all of the capital  stock of a wholly owned
subsidiary which held certain wireless  licenses for  approximately  32 million
shares of att common stock  in connection  with the exchange  we recognized a
pretax gain of 98 million  representing the difference between the fair value
of the  att  shares  received  of  100  million  and  our  cost  basis  in the
subsidiary

     income tax expense

     the decreases in income tax expense from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001
are  primarily  the result of the effects of changes in our income  before taxes
and minority interest and nondeductible goodwill amortization

     minority interest

     the  increase in minority  interest  from 2001 to 2002 is  attributable  to
increases  in the  net  income  of  our  less  than  wholly  owned  consolidated
subsidiaries  as well as to the  minority  interests  in  certain  subsidiaries
acquired in connection with the broadband acquisition  the increase in minority
interest from 2000 to 2001 is primarily  attributable  to the effects of changes
in  the  net  income  or  loss  of  our  less  than  wholly  owned  consolidated
subsidiaries

     cumulative effect of accounting change

     upon adoption of sfas no 133 we recognized as income a cumulative  effect
of accounting  change  net of related income taxes  of 385 million during the
year ended december 31 2001 the income consisted of a 400 million  adjustment
to  record  the debt  component  of our  zones at a  discount  from its value at
maturity and 192 million principally  related to the  reclassification of gains
previously  recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  income
loss on our equity  derivative  instruments  net of related  deferred  income
taxes of 207 million

     we believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation
